<head>NPNF1-05. St. Augustine: Anti-Pelagian Writings</head>

<pb n="ii"/>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series. The first series focuses on two classical Christian
theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. St.
Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most
popular two works--the Confessions and the City of
God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important
works of St. Augustine, such as On the Holy Trinity,
Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom was an
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St.
John took a more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much
of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly
what is now called social justice. He advocated for
the poor, and challenged abuses of authority. This volume
contains the majority of Augustine's writings against the
Pelagians. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive
in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive
and illuminating texts from some of the greatest theologians
of the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts
have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain
instructive and fruitful even today!

<p>Extract from Augustin’s Retractations. 115</p>
<p>Book I 116</p>
<p>Introductory, in the Shape of an Inscription to His Friend Marcellinus. 117</p>
<p>If Adam Had Not Sinned, He Would Never Have Died. 118</p>
<p>It is One Thing to Be Mortal, Another Thing to Be Subject to Death. 119</p>
<p>Even Bodily Death is from Sin. 120</p>
<p>The Words, Mortale (Capable of Dying), Mortuum (Dead), and Moriturus 
(Destined to Die).121</p>
<p>How It is that the Body Dead Because of Sin. 122</p>
<p>The Life of the Body the Object of Hope, the Life of the Spirit Being a Prelude 
to It.124</p>
<p>Bodily Death from Adam’s Sin. 125</p>
<p>Sin Passes on to All Men by Natural Descent, and Not Merely by Imitation. 126</p>
<p>The Analogy of Grace. 127</p>
<p>Distinction Between Actual and Original Sin. 128</p>

<pb n="iv"/>
<p>The Law Could Not Take Away Sin. 129</p>
<p>Meaning of the Apostle’s Phrase 'The Reign of Death.' 130</p>
<p>Superabundance of Grace. 131</p>
<p>The One Sin Common to All Men. 132</p>
<p>How Death is by One and Life by One. 133</p>
<p>Whom Sinners Imitate. 134</p>
<p>Only Christ Justifies. 135</p>
<p>Sin is from Natural Descent, as Righteousness is from Regeneration; How ‘All’ 
Are Sinners Through Adam, and ‘All’ Are Just Through Christ.136</p>
<p>Original Sin Alone is Contracted by Natural Birth. 138</p>
<p>Unbaptized Infants Damned, But Most Lightly; The Penalty of Adam’s Sin, the 
Grace of His Body Lost.139</p>
<p>To Infants Personal Sin is Not to Be Attributed. 140</p>
<p>He Refutes Those Who Allege that Infants are Baptized Not for the Remission 
of Sins, But for the Obtaining of the Kingdom of Heaven.141</p>
<p>Infants Saved as Sinners. 142</p>
<p>Infants are Described as Believers and as Penitents. Sins Alone Separate Between 
God and Men.143</p>
<p>No One, Except He Be Baptized, Rightly Comes to the Table of the Lord. 144</p>
<p>Infants Must Feed on Christ. 145</p>
<p>Baptized Infants, of the Faithful; Unbaptized, of the Lost. 146</p>
<p>It is an Inscrutable Mystery Why Some are Saved, and Others Not. 147</p>
<p>Why One is Baptized and Another Not, Not Otherwise Inscrutable. 148</p>
<p>He Refutes Those Who Suppose that Souls, on Account of Sins Committed in 
Another State, are Thrust into Bodies Suited to Their Merits, in Which They
are More or Less Tormented.149</p>
<p>The Case of Certain Idiots and Simpletons. 151</p>
<p>Christ is the Saviour and Redeemer Even of Infants. 153</p>
<p>Baptism is Called Salvation, and the Eucharist, Life, by the Christians of Carthage. 154</p>
<p>Unless Infants are Baptized, They Remain in Darkness. 156</p>
<p>Infants Not Enlightened as Soon as They are Born. 157</p>
<p>How God Enlightens Every Person. 158</p>
<p>What ‘Lighteth’ Means. 159</p>

<pb n="v"/>
<p>The Conclusion Drawn, that All are Involved in Original Sin. 161</p>
<p>A Collection of Scripture Testimonies. From the Gospels. 162</p>
<p>From the First Epistle of Peter. 163</p>
<p>From the First Epistle of John. 164</p>
<p>From the Epistle to the Romans. 165</p>
<p>From the Epistles to the Corinthians. 167</p>
<p>From the Epistle to the Galatians. 168</p>
<p>From the Epistle to the Ephesians. 169</p>
<p>From the Epistle to the Colossians. 170</p>
<p>From the Epistles to Timothy. 171</p>
<p>From the Epistle to Titus. 172</p>
<p>From the Epistle to the Hebrews. 173</p>
<p>From the Apocalypse. 175</p>
<p>From the Acts of the Apostles. 176</p>
<p>The Utility of the Books of the Old Testament. 177</p>
<p>By the Sacrifices of the Old Testament, Men Were Convinced of Sins and Led 
to the Saviour.178</p>
<p>He Concludes that All Men Need the Death of Christ, that They May Be Saved.
Unbaptized Infants Will Be Involved in the Condemnation of the Devil. How
All Men Through Adam are Unto Condemnation; And Through Christ Unto
Justification. No One is Reconciled with God, Except Through Christ. 180</p>
<p>No One is Reconciled to God Except Through Christ. 182</p>
<p>The Good of Marriage; Four Different Cases of the Good and the Evil Use of 
Matrimony.183</p>
<p>In What Respect the Pelagians Regarded Baptism as Necessary for Infants. 184</p>
<p>The Context of Their Chief Text. 185</p>
<p>Christ, the Head and the Body; Owing to the Union of the Natures in the Person 
of Christ, He Both Remained in Heaven, and Walked About on Earth; How the
One Christ Could Ascend to Heaven; The Head, and the Body, the One Christ.186</p>
<p>The Serpent Lifted Up in the Wilderness Prefigured Christ Suspended on the 
Cross; Even Infants Themselves Poisoned by the Serpent’s Bite.188</p>
<p>No One Can Be Reconciled to God, Except by Christ. 189</p>
<p>The Form, or Rite, of Baptism. Exorcism. 190</p>

<pb n="vi"/>
<p>A Twofold Mistake Respecting Infants. 191</p>
<p>In Infants There is No Sin of Their Own Commission. 192</p>
<p>Infants’ Faults Spring from Their Sheer Ignorance. 193</p>
<p>On the Ignorance of Infants, and Whence It Arises. 194</p>
<p>If Adam Was Not Created of Such a Character as that in Which We are Born, 
How is It that Christ, Although Free from Sin, Was Born an Infant and in
Weakness?195</p>
<p>The Ignorance and the Infirmity of an Infant. 196</p>
<p>How Far Sin is Done Away in Infants by Baptism, Also in Adults, and What 
Advantage Results Therefrom.197</p>
<p>Book II 198</p>
<p>What Has Thus Far Been Dwelt On; And What is to Be Treated in This Book. 199</p>
<p>Some Persons Attribute Too Much to the Freedom of Man’s Will; Ignorance 
and Infirmity.200</p>
<p>In What Way God Commands Nothing Impossible. Works of Mercy, Means 
of Wiping Out Sins.201</p>
<p>Concupiscence, How Far in Us; The Baptized are Not Injured by Concupiscence, 
But Only by Consent Therewith.202</p>
<p>The Will of Man Requires the Help of God. 204</p>
<p>Wherein the Pharisee Sinned When He Thanked God; To God’s Grace Must 
Be Added the Exertion of Our Own Will.205</p>
<p>Four Questions on the Perfection of Righteousness: (1.) Whether a Man Can 
Be Without Sin in This Life.206</p>
<p>(2) Whether There is in This World a Man Without Sin. 208</p>
<p>The Beginning of Renewal; Resurrection Called Regeneration; They are the Sons 
of God Who Lead Lives Suitable to Newness of Life.209</p>
<p>Perfection, When to Be Realized. 211</p>
<p>An Objection of the Pelagians: Why Does Not a Righteous Man Beget a Righteous 
Man?212</p>
<p>He Reconciles Some Passages of Scripture. 213</p>
<p>A Subterfuge of the Pelagians. 214</p>
<p>Job Was Not Without Sin. 215</p>
<p>Carnal Generation Condemned on Account of Original Sin. 217</p>

<pb n="vii"/>
<p>Job Foresaw that Christ Would Come to Suffer; The Way of Humility in Those 
that are Perfect.218</p>
<p>No One Righteous in All Things. 219</p>
<p>Perfect Human Righteousness is Imperfect. 220</p>
<p>Zacharias and Elisabeth, Sinners. 221</p>
<p>Paul Worthy to Be the Prince of the Apostles, and Yet a Sinner. 222</p>
<p>All Righteous Men Sinners. 224</p>
<p>An Objection of the Pelagians; Perfection is Relative; He is Rightly Said to Be 
Perfect in Righteousness Who Has Made Much Progress Therein.225</p>
<p>Why God Prescribes What He Knows Cannot Be Observed. 227</p>
<p>An Objection of the Pelagians. The Apostle Paul Was Not Free From Sin So 
Long as He Lived.228</p>
<p>God Punishes Both in Wrath and in Mercy. 230</p>
<p>(3)Why No One in This Life is Without Sin. 231</p>
<p>The Divine Remedy for Pride. 232</p>
<p>A Good Will Comes from God. 233</p>
<p>A Subterfuge of the Pelagians. 234</p>
<p>All Will is Either Good, and Then It Loves Righteousness, or Evil, When It Does 
Not Love Righteousness.235</p>
<p>Grace is Given to Some Men in Mercy; Is Withheld from Others in Justice and 
Truth.236</p>
<p>God’s Sovereignity in His Grace. 237</p>
<p>Through Grace We Have Both the Knowledge of Good, and the Delight Which 
It Affords.238</p>
<p>(4) That No Man, with the Exception of Christ, Has Ever Lived, or Can Live 
Without Sin.240</p>
<p>Adam and Eve; Obedience Most Strongly Enjoined by God on Man. 241</p>
<p>Man’s State Before the Fall. 243</p>
<p>The Corruption of Nature is by Sin, Its Renovation is by Christ. 245</p>
<p>What Benefit Has Been Conferred on Us by the Incarnation of the Word; Christ’s 
Birth in the Flesh, Wherein It is Like and Wherein Unlike Our Own Birth.246</p>
<p>An Objection of Pelagians. 248</p>
<p>An Argument Anticipated. 249</p>

<p>Sanctification Manifold; Sacrament of Catechumens. 251</p>
<p>Why the Children of the Baptized Should Be Baptized. 253</p>
<p>An Objection of the Pelagians. 254</p>
<p>The Law of Sin is Called Sin; How Concupiscence Still Remains After Its Evil 
Has Been Removed in the Baptized.255</p>
<p>Guilt May Be Taken Away But Concupiscence Remain. 256</p>
<p>All the Predestinated are Saved Through the One Mediator Christ, and by One 
and the Same Faith.257</p>
<p>Christ the Saviour Even of Infants; Christ, When an Infant, Was Free from 
Ignorance and Mental Weakness.258</p>
<p>An Objection of the Pelagians. 259</p>
<p>Why It is that Death Itself is Not Abolished, Along with Sin, by Baptism. 260</p>
<p>Why the Devil is Said to Hold the Power and Dominion of Death. 262</p>
<p>Why Christ, After His Resurrection, Withdrew His Presence from the World. 263</p>
<p>An Objection of the Pelagians. 264</p>
<p>Why Punishment is Still Inflicted, After Sin Has Been Forgiven. 265</p>
<p>To Recover the Righteousness Which Had Been Lost by Sin, Man Has to Struggle, 
with Abundant Labour and Sorrow.266</p>
<p>The Case of David, in Illustration. 267</p>
<p>Turn to Neither Hand. 268</p>
<p>'Likeness of Sinful Flesh' Implies the Reality. 269</p>
<p>Whether the Soul is Propagated; On Obscure Points, Concerning Which the 
Scriptures Give Us No Assistance, We Must Be on Our Guard Against Forming
Hasty Judgments and Opinions; The Scriptures are Clear Enough on Those
Subjects Which are Necessary to Salvation.270</p>

<p>The Occasion of Writing This Work; A Thing May Be Capable of Being Done, 
and Yet May Never Be Done.304</p>
<p>The Examples Apposite. 305</p>
<p>Theirs is Comparatively a Harmless Error, Who Say that a Man Lives Here Without 
Sin.306</p>
<p>Theirs is a Much More Serious Error, Requiring a Very Vigorous Refutation, Who 
Deny God’s Grace to Be Necessary.307</p>

<p>How that is to Be the Reward of All; The Apostle Earnestly Defends Grace. 352</p>
<p>The Law Written in the Heart, and the Reward of the Eternal Contemplation of

<p>A Question Touching the Passage in the Apostle About the Gentiles Who are Said 
to Do by Nature the Law’s Commands, Which They are Also Said to Have Written
on Their Hearts.358</p>
<p>The Answer Is, that the Passage Must Be Understood of the Faithful of the New 
Covenant.359</p>
<p>It is Not by Their Works, But by Grace, that the Doers of the Law are Justified; 
God’s Saints and God’s Name Hallowed in Different Senses.361</p>
<p>How the Passage of the Law Agrees with that of the Prophet. 363</p>
<p>The Law ‘Being Done by Nature’ Means, Done by Nature as Restored by Grace. 365</p>

<p>It Was a Matter of Justice that All Should Be Condemned. 405</p>
<p>The Pelagians Have Very Strong and Active Minds. 406</p>
<p>He Proceeds to Confute the Work of Pelagius; He Refrains as Yet from Mentioning 
Pelagius’ Name.407</p>
<p>A Distinction Drawn by Pelagius Between the Possible and Actual. 408</p>
<p>Even They Who Were Not Able to Be Justified are Condemned. 409</p>
<p>He Could Not Be Justified, Who Had Not Heard of the Name of Christ; Rendering 
the Cross of Christ of None Effect.410</p>

<p>What Prayer Pelagius Would Admit to Be Necessary. 420</p>
<p>Pelagius Denies that Human Nature Has Been Depraved or Corrupted by Sin. 421</p>
<p>How Our Nature Could Be Vitiated by Sin, Even Though It Be Not a Substance. 422</p>
<p>Adam Delivered by the Mercy of Christ. 423</p>
<p>Sin and the Penalty of Sin the Same. 424</p>
<p>God Forsakes Only Those Who Deserve to Be Forsaken. We are Sufficient of 
Ourselves to Commit Sin; But Not to Return to the Way of Righteousness. Death
is the Punishment, Not the Cause of Sin.426</p>
<p>Christ Died of His Own Power and Choice. 428</p>
<p>Even Evils, Through God’s Mercy, are of Use. 429</p>
<p>The Disposition of Nearly All Who Go Astray. With Some Heretics Our Business 
Ought Not to Be Disputation, But Prayer.430</p>
<p>A Simile to Show that God’s Grace is Necessary for Doing Any Good Work

<p>God Forsakes Us to Some Extent that We May Not Grow Proud. 434</p>
<p>Not Every Sin is Pride. How Pride is the Commencement of Every Sin. 435</p>
<p>A Man’s Sin is His Own, But He Needs Grace for His Cure. 436</p>
<p>Why God Does Not Immediately Cure Pride Itself. The Secret and Insidious 
Growth of Pride. Preventing and Subsequent Grace.437</p>
<p>Pride Even in Such Things as are Done Aright Must Be Avoided. Free Will is Not 
Taken Away When Grace is Preached.438</p>
<p>Being Wholly Without Sin Does Not Put Man on an Equality with God. 440</p>
<p>We Must Not Lie, Even for the Sake of Moderation. The Praise of Humility Must 
Not Be Placed to the Account of Falsehood.441</p>
<p>Pelagius Glorifies God as Creator at the Expense of God as Saviour. 442</p>

Fruit.665</p>
<p>How a Man Makes a Good or a Bad Tree. 666</p>
<p>Love the Root of All Good Things; Cupidity, of All Evil Ones. 667</p>

<p>Pelagius’ Double Dealing Concerning the Ground of the Conferrence of Grace. 669</p>
<p>Pelagius Places Free Will at the Basis of All Turning to God for Grace. 670</p>
<p>God by His Wonderful Power Works in Our Hearts Good Dispositions of Our 
Will. 672</p>
<p>The Pelagian Grace of ‘Capacity’ Exploded. The Scripture Teaches the Need of 
God’s Help in Doing, Speaking, and Thinking, Alike.673</p>
<p>What True Grace Is, and Wherefore Given. Merits Do Not Precede Grace. 675</p>
<p>Pelagius Teaches that Satan May Be Resisted Without the Help of the Grace of 
God. 676</p>
<p>When He Speaks of God’s Help, He Means It Only to Help Us Do What Without 
It We Still Could Do.677</p>
<p>What Pelagius Thinks is Needful for Ease of Performance is Really Necessary 
for the Performance. 678</p>
<p>Pelagius and Coelestius Nowhere Really Acknowledge Grace. 679</p>
<p>Why the Pelagians Deemed Prayers to Be Necessary. The Letter Which Pelagius 
Despatched to Pope Innocent with an Exposition of His Belief.680</p>
<p>Pelagius Professes Nothing on the Subject of Grace Which May Not Be 
Understood of the Law and Teaching.681</p>
<p>Pelagius Says that Grace is Given According to Men’s Merits. The Beginning, 
However, of Merit is Faith; And This is a Gratuitous Gift, Not a Recompense
for Our Merits.682</p>
<p>Pelagius Believes that Infants Have No Sin to Be Remitted in Baptism. 684</p>

<pb n="xxii"/>
<p>Coelestius Openly Declares Infants to Have No Original Sin. 685</p>

<p>Grace Placed by Pelagius in the Remission of Sins and the Example of Christ. 691</p>

the Most Hardened Sinner.692</p>
<p>Pelagius Once More Guards Himself Against the Necessity of Grace. 693</p>

Shame.750</p>
<p>The Evil of Lust Ought Not to Be Ascribed to Marriage. The Three Good Results 
of the Nuptial Ordinance: Offspring, Chastity, and the Sacramental Union.751</p>
<p>Human Offspring, Even Previous to Birth, Under Condemnation at the Very 
Root. Uses of Matrimony Undertaken for Mere Pleasure Not Without Venial
Fault.752</p>

<p>A Letter Addressed to the Count Valerius. 762</p>
<p>On Marriage and Concupiscence 764</p>
<p>Concerning the Argument of This Treatise. 765</p>
<p>Why This Treatise Was Addressed to Valerius. 766</p>
<p>Conjugal Chastity the Gift of God. 767</p>

<pb n="xxv"/>
<p>A Difficulty as Regards the Chastity of Unbelievers. None But a Believer is Truly 
a Chaste Man.768</p>
<p>The Natural Good of Marriage. All Society Naturally Repudiates a Fraudulent
Companion. What is True Conjugal Purity? No True Virginity and Chastity
Except in Devotion to True Faith. 769</p>
<p>The Censuring of Lust is Not a Condemnation of Marriage; Whence Comes 
Shame in the Human Body. Adam and Eve Were Not Created Blind; Meaning
of Their 'Eyes Being Opened.'771</p>
<p>Man’s Disobedience Justly Requited in the Rebellion of His Own Flesh; The 
Blush of Shame for the Disobedient Members of the Body.773</p>
<p>The Evil of Lust Does Not Take Away the Good of Marriage. 774</p>
<p>This Disease of Concupiscence in Marriage is Not to Be a Matter of Will, But 
of Necessity; What Ought to Be the Will of Believers in the Use of Matrimony;
Who is to Be Regarded as Using, and Not Succumbing To, the Evil of
Concupiscence; How the Holy Fathers of the Old Testament Formerly Used
Wives.775</p>
<p>Why It Was Sometimes Permitted that a Man Should Have Several Wives, Yet 
No Woman Was Ever Allowed to Have More Than One Husband. Nature
Prefers Singleness in Her Dominations.776</p>
<p>The Sacrament of Marriage; Marriage Indissoluble; The World’s Law About 
Divorce Different from the Gospel’s.777</p>
<p>Marriage Does Not Cancel a Mutual Vow of Continence; There Was True 
Wedlock Between Mary and Joseph; In What Way Joseph Was the Father of
Christ.779</p>
<p>In the Marriage of Mary and Joseph There Were All the Blessings of the Wedded 
State; All that is Born of Concubinage is Sinful Flesh.781</p>
<p>Before Christ It Was a Time for Marrying; Since Christ It Has Been a Time for 7
Continence.782</p>
<p>The Teaching of the Apostle on This Subject. 783</p>
<p>A Certain Degree of Intemperance is to Be Tolerated in the Case of Married 
Persons; The Use of Matrimony for the Mere Pleasure of Lust is Not Without
Sin, But Because of the Nuptial Relation the Sin is Venial.784</p>
<p>What is Sinless in the Use of Matrimony? What is Attended With Venial Sin, 
and What with Mortal? 786</p>
<p>Continence Better Than Marriage; But Marriage Better Than Fornication. 787</p>
<p>Blessing of Matrimony. 788</p>

<pb n="xxvi"/>
<p>Why Children of Wrath are Born of Holy Matrimony. 789</p>
<p>Thus Sinners are Born of Righteous Parents, Even as Wild Olives Spring from 
the Olive.791</p>
<p>Even Infants, When Unbaptized, are in the Power of the Devil; Exorcism in the 
Case of Infants, and Renunciation of the Devil.792</p>
<p>Sin Has Not Arisen Out of the Goodness of Marriage; The Sacrament of 
Matrimony a Great One in the Case of Christ and the Church—A Very Small
One in the Case of a Man and His Wife.793</p>
<p>Lust and Shame Come from Sin; The Law of Sin; The Shamelessness of the 
Cynics.794</p>
<p>Concupiscence in the Regenerate Without Consent is Not Sin; In What Sense 
Concupiscence is Called Sin.795</p>
<p>Whatever is Born Through Concupiscence is Not Undeservedly in Subjection 
to the Devil by Reason of Sin; The Devil Deserves Heavier Punishment Than
Men.796</p>
<p>Through Lust Original Sin is Transmitted; Venial Sins in Married Persons; 
Concupiscence of the Flesh, the Daughter and Mother of Sin.797</p>
<p>Concupiscence Remains After Baptism, Just as Languor Does After Recovery 
from Disease; Concupiscence is Diminished in Persons of Advancing Years,
and Increased in the Incontinent.798</p>
<p>How Concupiscence Remains in the Baptized in Act, When It Has Passed Away 
as to Its Guilt.799</p>
<p>The Evil Desires of Concupiscence; We Ought to Wish that They May Not Be. 800</p>
<p>Who is the Man that Can Say, ‘It is No More I that Do It’? 801</p>
<p>When Good Will Be Perfectly Done. 802</p>
<p>True Freedom Comes with Willing Delight in God’s Law. 803</p>
<p>How Concupiscence Made a Captive of the Apostle; What the Law of Sin Was 
to the Apostle.804</p>
<p>The Flesh, Carnal Affection. 805</p>
<p>Even Now While We Still Have Concupiscence We May Be Safe in Christ. 807</p>
<p>The Law of Sin with Its Guilt in Unbaptized Infants. By Adam’s Sin the Human 
Race Has Become a 'Wild Olive Tree.'808</p>
<p>To Baptism Must Be Referred All Remission of Sins, and the Complete Healing 
of the Resurrection. Daily Cleansing.809</p>

<pb n="xxvii"/>
<p>By the Holiness of Baptism, Not Sins Only, But All Evils Whatsoever, Have to 
Be Removed. The Church is Not Yet Free from All Stain.810</p>

to Show that the Desire of the Flesh is a Natural Good.811</p>

<p>Augustin Adduces a Passage Selected from the Preface of Julianus. (See ‘The 
Unfinished Work,’ i. 73.)820</p>
<p>Augustin Refutes the Passage Adduced Above. 821</p>
<p>The Catholics Maintain the Doctrine of Original Sin, and Thus are Far from 
Being Manicheans.822</p>
<p>In What Manner the Adversary’s Cavils Must Be Refuted. 824</p>
<p>The Devil the Author, Not of Nature, But Only of Sin. 825</p>
<p>Eve’s Name Means Life, and is a Great Sacrament of the Church. 826</p>
<p>The Pelagian Argument to Show that the Devil Has No Rights in the Fruits of 
Marriage.828</p>
<p>Concupiscence Alone, in Marriage, is Not of God. 829</p>
<p>Man, by Birth, is Placed Under the Dominion of the Devil Through Sin; We 
Were All One in Adam When He Sinned.830</p>
<p>It is Not of Us, But Our Sins, that the Devil is the Author. 832</p>
<p>The Pelagians are Not Ashamed to Eulogize Concupiscence, Although They 
are Ashamed to Mention Its Name.833</p>
<p>The Same Continued. 834</p>
<p>The Pelagians Misunderstand ‘Seed’ In Scripture. 835</p>
<p>Original Sin is Derived from the Faulty Condition of Human Seed. 836</p>
<p>It is the Good God That Gives Fruitfulness, and the Devil That Corrupts the 
Fruit.837</p>

<pb n="xxviii"/>
<p>Shall We Be Ashamed of What We Do, or of What God Does? 838</p>
<p>The Pelagians Affirm that God in the Case of Abraham and Sarah Aroused 
Concupiscence as a Gift from Heaven.839</p>
<p>What Covenant of God the New-Born Babe Breaks. What Was the Value of 
Circumcision.840</p>
<p>Augustin Not the Deviser of Original Sin. 842</p>
<p>The Child in No Sense Formed by Concupiscence. 843</p>
<p>The Pelagians Argue that God Sometimes Closes the Womb in Anger, and 
Opens It When Appeased.844</p>
<p>Augustin’s Answer to This Argument. Its Dealing with Scripture. 846</p>
<p>The Same Continued. Augustin Also Asserts that God Forms Man at Birth. 847</p>
<p>The Case of Abimelech and His House Examined. 848</p>
<p>Why God Proceeds to Create Human Beings, Who He Knows Will Be Born in 
Sin.849</p>
<p>God Not the Author of the Evil in Those Whom He Creates. 850</p>
<p>Though God Makes Us, We Perish Unless He Re-makes Us in Christ. 851</p>
<p>The Pelagians Argue that Cohabitation Rightly Used is a Good, and What is 
Born from It is Good.852</p>
<p>He Answers the Arguments of Julianus. What is the Natural Use of the Woman? 
What is the Unnatural Use?854</p>
<p>God Made Nature Good: the Saviour Restores It When Corrupted. 855</p>
<p>If There is No Marriage Without Cohabitation, So There is No Cohabitation
Without Shame.856</p>
<p>Jovinian Used Formerly to Call Catholics Manicheans; The Arians Also Used 
to Call Catholics Sabellians.857</p>
<p>Man Born of Whatever Parentage is Sinful and Capable of Redemption. 858</p>
<p>Augustin Declines the Dilemma Offered Him. 859</p>
<p>The Pelagians Argue that Original Sin Cannot Come Through Marriage If 
Marriage is Good.860</p>
<p>The Pelagians Try to Get Rid of Original Sin by Their Praise of God’s Works; 
Marriage, in Its Nature and by Its Institution, is Not the Cause of Sin.861</p>
<p>The Good Tree in the Gospel that Cannot Bring Forth Evil Fruit, Does Not
Mean Marriage.863</p>

<pb n="xxix"/>
<p>The Pelagians Argue that If Sin Comes by Birth, All Married People Deserve 
Condemnation.864</p>
<p>Answer to This Argument: The Apostle Says We All Sinned in One. 865</p>
<p>The Reign of Death, What It Is; The Figure of the Future Adam; How All Men
are Justified Through Christ.866</p>
<p>The Scriptures Repeatedly Teach Us that All Sin in One. 868</p>
<p>Original Sin Arose from Adam’s Depraved Will. Whence the Corrupt Will 
Sprang.869</p>
<p>In Infants Nature is of God, and the Corruption of Nature of the Devil. 870</p>
<p>The Rise and Origin of Evil. The Exorcism and Exsufflation of Infants, a Primitive
Christian Rite.871</p>
<p>To Call Those that Teach Original Sin Manicheans is to Accuse Ambrose, 
Cyprian, and the Whole Church.873</p>
<p>Sin Was the Origin of All Shameful Concupiscence. 874</p>
<p>Concupiscence Need Not Have Been Necessary for Fruitfulness. 875</p>
<p>How Marriage is Now Different Since the Existence of Sin. 877</p>
<p>Lust is a Disease; The Word ‘Passion’ In the Ecclesiastical Sense. 878</p>
<p>The Pelagians Allow that Christ Died Even for Infants; Julianus Slays Himself 
with His Own Sword.879</p>
<p>The Great Sin of the First Man. 881</p>
<p>Adam’s Sin is Derived from Him to Every One Who is Born Even of Regenerate 
Parents; The Example of the Olive Tree and the Wild Olive.882</p>
<p>The Pelagians Can Hardly Venture to Place Concupiscence in Paradise Before 
the Commission of Sin.883</p>
<p>Let Not the Pelagians Indulge Themselves in a Cruel Defence of Infants. 885</p>

<p>Extract from Augustin’s Retractations. 887</p>

<p>Treatise on the Soul and Its Origin 890</p>
<p>Renatus Had Done Him a Kindness by Sending Him the Books Which Had 
Been Addressed to Him.891</p>

<pb n="xxx"/>
<p>He Receives with a Kindly and Patient Feeling the Books of a Young and
Inexperienced Man Who Wrote Against Him in a Tone of Arrogance. Vincentius
Victor Converted from the Sect of the Rogatians.892</p>
<p>The Eloquence of Vincentius, Its Dangers and Its Tolerableness. 893</p>
<p>The Errors Contained in the Books of Vincentius Victor. He Says that the Soul
Comes from God, But Was Not Made Either Out of Nothing or Out of Any
Created Thing.894</p>
<p>Another of Victor’s Errors, that the Soul is Corporeal. 895</p>
<p>Another Error Out of His Second Book, to the Effect, that the Soul Deserved to 
Be Polluted by the Body.896</p>
<p>Victor Entangles Himself in an Exceedingly Difficult Question. God’s 
Foreknowledge is No Cause of Sin.897</p>
<p>Victor’s Erroneous Opinion, that the Soul Deserved to Become Sinful. 898</p>
<p>Victor Utterly Unable to Explain How the Sinless Soul Deserved to Be Made 
Sinful.899</p>
<p>Another Error of Victor’s, that Infants Dying Unbaptized May Attain to the 
Kingdom of Heaven. Another, that the Sacrifice of the Body of Christ Must Be
Offered for Infants Who Die Before They are Baptized.901</p>
<p>Martyrdom for Christ Supplies the Place of Baptism. The Faith of the Thief 
Who Was Crucified Along with Christ Taken as Martyrdom and Hence for
Baptism.902</p>
<p>Dinocrates, Brother of the Martyr St. Perpetua, is Said to Have Been Delivered 
from the State of Condemnation by the Prayers of the Saint.904</p>
<p>The Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ Will Not Avail for Unbaptized 
Persons, and Can Not Be Offered for the Majority of Those Who Die Unbaptized.905</p>
<p>Victor’s Dilemma: He Must Either Say All Infants are Saved, or Else God Slays 
the Innocent.906</p>
<p>God Does Not Judge Any One for What He Might Have Done If His Life Had 
Been Prolonged, But Simply for the Deeds He Actually Commits.907</p>
<p>Difficulty in the Opinion Which Maintains that Souls are Not by Propagation. 909</p>
<p>He Shows that the Passages of Scripture Adduced by Victor Do Not Prove that 
Souls are Made by God in Such a Way as Not to Be Derived by Propagation:
First Passage.910</p>
<p>By ‘Breath’ Is Signified Sometimes the Holy Spirit. 911</p>

<p>His Fourth Quotation. 918</p>
<p>Whether or No the Soul is Derived by Natural Descent (Ex Traduce), His Cited 
Passages Fail to Show.919</p>
<p>Just as the Mother Knows Not Whence Comes Her Child Within Her, So We 
Know Not Whence Comes the Soul.920</p>
<p>The Fifth Passage of Scripture Quoted by Victor. 922</p>
<p>Augustin Did Not Venture to Define Anything About the Propagation of the 
Soul.924</p>
<p>A Natural Figure of Speech Must Not Be Literally Pressed. 926</p>
<p>The Sixth Passage of Scripture Quoted by Victor. 928</p>
<p>The Danger of Arguing from Silence. 929</p>
<p>The Argument of the Apollinarians to Prove that Christ Was Without the 
Human Soul of This Same Sort.930</p>
<p>The Self-Contradiction of Victor as to the Origin of the Soul. 931</p>
<p>Augustin Has No Objection to the Opinion About the Propagation of Souls 
Being Refuted, and that About Their Insufflation Being Maintained.932</p>
<p>The Mistakes Which Must Be Avoided by Those Who Say that Men’s Souls are 
Not Derived from Their Parents, But are Afresh Inbreathed by God in Every
Instance.933</p>
<p>Conclusion. 934</p>
<p>Book II 935</p>
<p>Depraved Eloquence an Injurious Accomplishment. 936</p>
<p>He Asks What the Great Knowledge is that Victor Imparts. 937</p>
<p>The Difference Between the Senses of the Body and Soul. 938</p>
<p>To Believe the Soul is a Part of God is Blasphemy. 939</p>
<p>In What Sense Created Beings are Out of God. 940</p>
<p>Shall God’s Nature Be Mutable, Sinful, Impious, Even Eternally Damned. 941</p>
<p>To Think the Soul Corporeal an Error. 942</p>
<p>The Thirst of the Rich Man in Hell Does Not Prove the Soul to Be Corporeal. 943</p>
<p>How Could the Incorporeal God Breathe Out of Himself a Corporeal Substance? 945</p>
<p>Children May Be Found of Like or of Unlike Dispositions with Their Parents. 947</p>

<pb n="xxxii"/>
<p>Victor Implies that the Soul Had a ‘State’ And ‘Merit’ Before Incarnation. 948</p>
<p>How Did the Soul Deserve to Be Incarnated? 949</p>
<p>Victor Teaches that God Thwarts His Own Predestination. 950</p>
<p>Victor Sends Those Infants Who Die Unbaptized to Paradise and the Heavenly 
Mansions, But Not to the Kingdom of Heaven.952</p>
<p>Victor ‘Decides’ That Oblations Should Be Offered Up for Those Who Die 
Unbaptized.954</p>
<p>Victor Promises to the Unbaptized Paradise After Their Death, and the Kingdom 
of Heaven After Their Resurrection, Although He Admits that This Opposes
Christ’s Statement.955</p>

<p>Why Heretical Writings Must Be Answered. 1047</p>
<p>Why He Addresses His Book to Boniface. 1048</p>
<p>The Calumny of Julian,—That the Catholics Teach that Free Will is Taken Away 
by Adam’s Sin.1049</p>
<p>Free Choice Did Not Perish With Adam ’s Sin. What Freedom Did Perish. 1050</p>
<p>Grace is Not Given According to Merits. 1051</p>
<p>He Concludes that He Does Not Deprive the Wicked of Free Will. 1053</p>
<p>The Pelagians Demolish Free Will. 1054</p>
<p>Another Calumny of Julian,—That 'It is Said that Marriage is Not Appointed 
by God.'1055</p>
<p>The Third Calumny,—The Assertion that Conjugal Intercourse is Condemned. 1056</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Pelagians in Praising the Innocence of Conjugal Intercourse. 1057</p>
<p>The Fourth Calumny,—That the Saints of the Old Testament are Said to Be Not 
Free from Sins.1058</p>
<p>The Fifth Calumny,—That It is Said that Paul and the Rest of the Apostles Were 
Polluted by Lust.1059</p>
<p>That the Apostle is Speaking in His Own Person and that of Others Who Are 
Under Grace, Not Still Under Law.1061</p>
<p>He Sins in Will Who is Only Deterred from Sinning by Fear. 1062</p>
<p>How Sin Died, and How It Revived. 1063</p>
<p>'The Law is Spiritual, But I Am Carnal,' To Be Understood of Paul. 1064</p>
<p>How the Apostle Said that He Did the Evil that He Would Not. 1065</p>
<p>What It is to Accomplish What is Good. 1066</p>
<p>In Me, that Is, in My Flesh. 1067</p>

Grace.1069</p>
<p>What It is to Be Delivered from the Body of This Death. 1070</p>

<pb n="xxxvi"/>
<p>He Concludes that the Apostle Spoke in His Own Person, and that of Those 
Who are Under Grace.1071</p>
<p>The Sixth Calumny,—That Augustin Asserts that Even Christ Was Not Free
from Sins.1072</p>
<p>The Seventh Calumny,—That Augustin Asserts that in Baptism All Sins are Not
Remitted.1073</p>
<p>In What Sense Lust is Called Sin in the Regenerate. 1074</p>
<p>Many Without Crime, None Without Sin. 1075</p>
<p>Julian Opposes the Faith of His Friends to the Opinions of Catholic Believers.
First of All, of Free Will. 1076</p>
<p>Secondly, of Marriage. 1077</p>
<p>Thirdly, of Conjugal Intercourse. 1078</p>

<p>The Shame of Nakedness. 1080</p>
<p>Whether There Could Be Sensual Appetite in Paradise Before the Fall. 1081</p>
<p>Desire in Paradise Was Either None at All, or It Was Obedient to the Impulse 
of the Will.1082</p>
<p>Julian’s Fourth Objection, that Man is God’s Work, and is Not Constrained to 
Evil or Good by His Power.1083</p>
<p>The Beginning of a Good Will is the Gift of Grace. 1084</p>
<p>The Power of God’s Grace is Proved. 1086</p>
<p>Julian’s Fifth Objection Concerning the Saints of the Old Testament. 1088</p>
<p>The Sixth Objection, Concerning the Necessity of Grace for All, and Concerning
the Baptism of Infants.1089</p>
<p>The Seventh Objection, of the Effect of Baptism. 1090</p>
<p>He Rebuts the Conclusion of Julian’s Letter. 1091</p>

<p>He Replies to the Calumnies of the Pelagians. 1102</p>
<p>Why the Pelagians Falsely Accuse Catholics of Maintaining Fate Under the 
Name of Grace.1103</p>
<p>The Accusation of Fate is Thrown Back Upon the Adversaries. 1105</p>
<p>What is Meant Under the Name of Fate. 1107</p>
<p>He Repels the Calumny Concerning the Acceptance of Persons. 1108</p>
<p>He Illustrates His Argument by an Example. 1110</p>
<p>The Apostle Meets the Question by Leaving It Unsolved. 1111</p>
<p>The Pelagians are Refuted by the Case of the Twin Infants Dying, the One After, 
and the Other Without, the Grace of Baptism.1113</p>
<p>Even the Desire of an Imperfect Good is a Gift of Grace, Otherwise Grace Would 
Be Given According to Merits.1114</p>
<p>The Desire of Good is God’s Gift. 1115</p>
<p>He Interprets the Scriptures Which the Pelagians Make Ill Use of. 1117</p>
<p>God’s Agency is Needful Even in Man’s Doings. 1118</p>
<p>Man Does No Good Thing Which God Does Not Cause Him to Do. 1119</p>

<p>The New Testament is More Ancient Than the Old; But It Was Subsequently
Revealed.1132</p>

<p>The Subterfuges of the Pelagians are Five. 1162</p>
<p>The Praise of the Creature. 1163</p>

Wise as to Condemn as Well Pelagians as Manicheans.1165</p>

<pb n="xl"/>
<p>Abstract. 1222</p>
<p>The Occasion and Argument of This Work. 1223</p>
<p>He Proves the Existence of Free Will in Man from the Precepts Addressed to 
Him by God.1224</p>
<p>Sinners are Convicted When Attempting to Excuse Themselves by Blaming 
God, Because They Have Free Will.1225</p>
<p>The Divine Commands Which are Most Suited to the Will Itself Illustrate Its 
Freedom.1226</p>
<p>He Shows that Ignorance Affords No Such Excuse as Shall Free the Offender 
from Punishment; But that to Sin with Knowledge is a Graver Thing Than to
Sin in Ignorance.1228</p>
<p>God’s Grace to Be Maintained Against the Pelagians; The Pelagian Heresy Not
an Old One.1230</p>
<p>Grace is Necessary Along with Free Will to Lead a Good Life. 1231</p>
<p>Conjugal Chastity is Itself the Gift of God. 1232</p>
<p>Entering into Temptation. Prayer is a Proof of Grace. 1234</p>
<p>Free Will and God’s Grace are Simultaneously Commended. 1235</p>
<p>Other Passages of Scripture Which the Pelagians Abuse. 1236</p>
<p>He Proves Out of St. Paul that Grace is Not Given According to Men’s Merits. 1237</p>
<p>The Grace of God is Not Given According to Merit, But Itself Makes All Good 
Desert.1239</p>
<p>Paul First Received Grace that He Might Win the Crown. 1240</p>
<p>The Pelagians Profess that the Only Grace Which is Not Given According to 
Our Merits is that of the Forgiveness of Sins.1241</p>
<p>Paul Fought, But God Gave the Victory: He Ran, But God Showed Mercy. 1242</p>
<p>The Faith that He Kept Was the Free Gift of God. 1243</p>
<p>Faith Without Good Works is Not Sufficient for Salvation. 1244</p>
<p>How is Eternal Life Both a Reward for Service and a Free Gift of Grace? 1245</p>
<p>The Question Answered. Justification is Grace Simply and Entirely, Eternal Life 
is Reward and Grace.1246</p>
<p>Eternal Life is 'Grace for Grace.' 1248</p>
<p>Who is the Transgressor of the Law? The Oldness of Its Letter. The Newness of 
Its Spirit.1250</p>

<pb n="xli"/>
<p>The Pelagians Maintain that the Law is the Grace of God Which Helps Us Not 
to Sin.1252</p>
<p>Who May Be Said to Wish to Establish Their Own Righteousness. ‘God’s 
Righteousness,’ So Called, Which Man Has from God.1253</p>
<p>As The Law is Not, So Neither is Our Nature Itself that Grace by Which We are 
Christians.1255</p>
<p>The Pelagians Contend that the Grace, Which is Neither the Law Nor Nature,
Avails Only to the Remission of Past Sins, But Not to the Avoidance of Future
Ones.1256</p>
<p>Grace Effects the Fulfilment of the Law, the Deliverance of Nature, and the 
Suppression of Sin’s Dominion.1257</p>
<p>Faith is the Gift of God. 1258</p>
<p>God is Able to Convert Opposing Wills, and to Take Away from the Heart Its 
Hardness.1259</p>
<p>The Grace by Which the Stony Heart is Removed is Not Preceded by Good 
Deserts, But by Evil Ones.1260</p>
<p>Free Will Has Its Function in the Heart’s Conversion; But Grace Too Has Its. 1262</p>
<p>In What Sense It is Rightly Said That, If We Like, We May Keep God’s 
Commandments.1263</p>
<p>A Good Will May Be Small and Weak; An Ample Will, Great Love. Operating 
and Co-operating Grace.1265</p>
<p>The Apostle’s Eulogy of Love. Correction to Be Administered with Love. 1267</p>
<p>Commendations of Love. 1269</p>
<p>Love Commended by Our Lord Himself. 1270</p>
<p>The Love Which Fulfils the Commandments is Not of Ourselves, But of God. 1271</p>
<p>We Would Not Love God Unless He First Loved Us. The Apostles Chose Christ 
Because They Were Chosen; They Were Not Chosen Because They Chose Christ.1272</p>
<p>The Spirit of Fear a Great Gift of God. 1273</p>
<p>The Ignorance of the Pelagians in Maintaining that the Knowledge of the Law
Comes from God, But that Love Comes from Ourselves.1274</p>
<p>The Wills of Men are So Much in the Power of God, that He Can Turn Them 
Whithersoever It Pleases Him.1275</p>
<p>God Does Whatsoever He Wills in the Hearts of Even Wicked Men. 1277</p>
<p>God Operates on Men’s Hearts to Incline Their Wills Whithersoever He Pleases. 1280</p>
<p>Gratuitous Grace Exemplified in Infants. 1281</p>

<p>The Necessity and Advantage of Rebuke. 1295</p>
<p>Further Replies to Those Who Object to Rebuke. 1296</p>
<p>Why They May Justly Be Rebuked Who Do Not Obey God, Although They Have 
Not Yet Received the Grace of Obedience.1297</p>
<p>All Perseverance is God’s Gift. 1298</p>
<p>They Who Have Not Received the Gift of Perseverance, and Have Relapsed into 
Mortal Sin and Have Died Therein, Must Righteously Be Condemned.1301</p>
<p>They Who Have Not Received Perseverance are Not Distinguished from the Mass 
of Those that are Lost.1302</p>
<p>Election is of Grace, Not of Merit. 1303</p>
<p>None of the Elect and Predestinated Can Perish. 1304</p>
<p>Perseverance is Given to the End. 1306</p>
<p>Whosoever Do Not Persevere are Not Distinguished from the Mass of Perdition 
by Predestination.1307</p>
<p>Why Perseverance Should Be Given to One and Not Another is Inscrutable. 1308</p>
<p>Some Instances of God’s Amazing Judgments. 1309</p>
<p>God’s Ways Past Finding Out. 1310</p>
<p>Some are Children of God According to Grace Temporally Received, Some 
According to God’s Eternal Foreknowledge.1312</p>
<p>Who May Be Understood as Given to Christ. 1314</p>

<pb n="xliii"/>
<p>True Children of God are True Disciples of Christ. 1315</p>
<p>Those Who are Called According to the Purpose Alone are Predestinated. 1316</p>
<p>Even the Sins of the Elect are Turned by God to Their Advantage. 1317</p>
<p>Therefore Rebuke is to Be Used. 1319</p>
<p>Whether Adam Received the Gift of Perseverance. 1320</p>
<p>The Answer. 1321</p>
<p>The First Man Himself Also Might Have Stood by His Free Will. 1322</p>
<p>Distinction Between the Grace Given Before and After the Fall. 1323</p>
<p>The Incarnation of the Word. 1324</p>
<p>The First Man Had Received the Grace Necessary for His Perseverance, But Its 
Exercise Was Left in His Free Choice.1326</p>
<p>The Gifts of Grace Conferred on Adam in Creation. 1327</p>
<p>What is the Difference Between the Ability Not to Sin, to Die, and Forsake Good, 
and the Inability to Sin, to Die, and to Forsake Good?1328</p>
<p>The Aid Without Which a Thing Does Not Come to Pass, and the Aid with Which
a Thing Comes to Pass.1329</p>
<p>There is a Greater Freedom Now in the Saints Than There Was Before in Adam. 1330</p>
<p>God Not Only Foreknows that Men Will Be Good, But Himself Makes Them So. 1332</p>
<p>To a Sound Will is Committed the Power of Persevering or of Not Persevering. 1333</p>
<p>What is the Nature of the Gift of Perseverance that is Now Given to the Saints. 1334</p>
<p>The Number of the Predestinated is Certain and Defined. 1335</p>
<p>No One is Certain and Secure of His Own Predestination and Salvation. 1336</p>
<p>Even in Judgment God’s Mercy Will Be Necessary to Us. 1337</p>
<p>The Reprobate are to Be Punished for Merits of a Different Kind. 1338</p>
<p>Rebuke and Grace Do Not Set Aside One Another. 1339</p>
<p>In What Way God Wills All Men to Be Saved. 1340</p>
<p>Scriptural Instances Wherein It is Proved that God Has Men’s Wills More in His 
Power Than They Themselves Have.1341</p>
<p>Rebuke Must Be Varied According to the Variety of Faults. There is No

<head>Preface to the American Edition.</head>
<p>“This volume contains all the Anti-Pelagian writings of Augustin, collected by the Benedictine
editors in their tenth volume, with the exception only of the two long works Against
Julian, and The Unfinished Work, which have been necessarily excluded on account of their
bulk. The translation here printed is that of the English version of Augustin’s works, published
by Messrs. T. and T. Clark at Edinburgh. This translation has been carefully compared with
the Latin throughout, and corrected on every page into more accurate conformity to its
sense. But this has not so altered its character that it ceases to be the Edinburgh translation,—
bettered somewhat, but still essentially the same. The excellent translation of the
three treatises, On the Spirit and the Letter, On Nature and Grace, and On the Proceedings
of Pelagius, published in the early summer of this year by two Oxford scholars, Messrs.
Woods and Johnston (London: David Nutt), was unfortunately too late in reaching America
to be of any service to the editor.</p>
<p>“What may be called the explanatory matter of the Edinburgh translation, has been
treated here even more freely than the text. The headings to the chapters have been added
to until nearly every chapter is now provided with a caption. The brackets which distinguished
the notes added by the translator from those which he translated from the Benedictine editor,
have been generally removed, and the notes themselves often verbally changed, or otherwise
altered. A few notes have been added,—chiefly with the design of rendering the allusions
in the text intelligible to the uninstructed reader; and the more lengthy of these have been
enclosed in brackets, and signed with a W. The result of all this is, that it is unsafe to hold
the Edinburgh translators too closely responsible for the unbracketed matter; but that the
American editor has not claimed as his own more than is really his.</p>
<p>“In preparing an Introductory Essay for the volume, two objects have been kept in view:
to place the necessary Prolegomena to the following treatises in the hands of the reader, and
to furnish the English reader with some illustrations of the Anti-Pelagian treatises from the
other writings of Augustin. In the former interest, a brief sketch of the history of the Pelagian
controversy and of the Pelagian and Augustinian systems has been given, and the occasions,
objects, and contents of the several treatises have been briefly stated. In the latter, Augustin’s
letters and sermons have been as copiously extracted as the limits of space allowed. In the
nature of the case, the sources have been independently examined for these materials; but
those who have written of Pelagianism and of Augustin’s part in the controversy with it,
have not been neglected. Above others, probably special obligations ought to be acknowledged
to the Benedictine preface to their tenth volume, and to Canon Bright’s Introduction to his
edition of Select Anti-Pelagian Treatises. The purpose of this essay will be subserved if it

<pb n="7"/>
enables the reader to attack the treatises themselves with increased interest and readiness
to assimilate and estimate their contents.</p>
<p>“References to the treatises in the essay, and cross-references in the treatises themselves,
have been inserted wherever they seemed absolutely necessary; but they have been often
omitted where otherwise they would have been inserted because it has been thought that
the Index of Subjects will suffice for all the needs of comparison of passages that are likely
to arise. In the Index of Texts, an asterisk marks some of those places where a text is fully
explained; and students of the history of Biblical Interpretation may find this feature helpful
to them. It will not be strange, if, on turning up a few passages, they will find their notion
of the power, exactness, and devout truth of Augustin as an interpreter of Scripture very
much raised above what the current histories of interpretation have taught them.”</p>
<p>The above has been prepared by Dr. Warfield. I need only add that the present volume
contains the most important of the doctrinal and polemical works of Augustin, which exerted
a powerful influence upon the Reformers of the sixteenth century and upon the Jansenists
in the seventeenth. They constitute what is popularly called the Augustinian system, though
they only represent one side of it. Enough has been said on their merits in the Prolegomena
to the first volume, and in the valuable Introductory Essay of Dr. Warfield, who has been
called to fill the chair of systematic theology once adorned by the learning and piety of the
immortal Hodges, father and son.</p>
<p>The remaining three volumes will contain the exegetical writings of the great Bishop of
Hippo.</p>

xi.): viz., the Expositions on Paul’s Epistles, written before 410 (but somewhat, especially in
Romans, interpolated); the Epistle to Demetrias, 413; and the Confession of Faith, 417, addressed
to Innocent I. Copious fragments of other works (On Nature, In Defence of Free
Will, Chapters, Letter to Innocent) are found quoted in Augustin’s refutations; as also of
certain works by Coelestius (e.g., his Definitions, Confession to Zosimus), and of the writings
of Julian. Here also belong Cassian’s Collationes Patrum, and the works of the other semi-
Pelagian writers.</p>
<p>II. Augustin’s anti-Pelagian treatises; also his work On Heresies, 88, 428; many of his
letters, as e.g., those numbered by the Benedictines, 140, 157, 178, 179, 190, 191, 193, 194;
and many of his letters, as e.g., 155, 163, 165, 168, 169, 174, 176, 293, 294, etc. Jerome’s Letter
to Ctesiphon (133), and his three books of Dialogue against the Pelagians (vol. ii. of Vallarsius);

<head>I. The Origin and Nature of Pelagianism.</head>
<p>It was inevitable that the energy of the Church in intellectually realizing and defining
its doctrines in relation to one another, should first be directed towards the objective side
of Christian truth. The chief controversies of the first four centuries and the resulting
definitions of doctrine, concerned the nature of God and the person of Christ; and it was
not until these theological and Christological questions were well upon their way to final
settlement, that the Church could turn its attention to the more subjective side of truth.
Meanwhile she bore in her bosom a full recognition, side by side, of the freedom of the will,
the evil consequences of the fall, and the necessity of divine grace for salvation. Individual
writers, or even the several sections of the Church, might exhibit a tendency to throw emphasis
on one or another of the elements that made up this deposit of faith that was the
common inheritance of all. The East, for instance, laid especial stress on free will: and the
West dwelt more pointedly on the ruin of the human race and the absolute need of God’s
grace for salvation. But neither did the Eastern theologians forget the universal sinfulness
and need of redemption, or the necessity, for the realization of that redemption, of God’s
gracious influences; nor did those of the West deny the self-determination or accountability
of men. All the elements of the composite doctrine of man were everywhere confessed; but
they were variously emphasized, according to the temper of the writers or the controversial
demands of the times. Such a state of affairs, however, was an invitation to heresy, and a
prophecy of controversy; just as the simultaneous confession of the unity of God and the
Deity of Christ, or of the Deity and the humanity of Christ, inevitably carried in its train a
series of heresies and controversies, until the definitions of the doctrines of the Trinity and
of the person of Christ were complete. In like manner, it was inevitable that sooner or later
some one should arise who would so one-sidedly emphasize one element or the other of
the Church’s teaching as to salvation, as to throw himself into heresy, and drive the Church,
through controversy with him, into a precise definition of the doctrines of free will and
grace in their mutual relations.</p>
<p>This new heresiarch came, at the opening of the fifth century, in the person of the British
monk, Pelagius. The novelty of the doctrine which he taught is repeatedly asserted by Augustin1,
and is evident to the historian; but it consisted not in the emphasis that he laid on
free will, but rather in the fact that, in emphasizing free will, he denied the ruin of the race
and the necessity of grace. This was not only new in Christianity; it was even anti-Christian.

Jerome, as well as Augustin, saw this at the time, and speaks of Pelagianism as the “heresy
of Pythagoras and Zeno;”2 and modern writers of the various schools have more or less fully
recognized it. Thus Dean Milman thinks that “the greater part” of Pelagius’ letter to Demetrias
“might have been written by an ancient academic;”3 Dr. De Pressensé identifies the Pelagian
idea of liberty with that of Paganism;4 and Bishop Hefele openly declares that their fundamental
doctrine, “that man is virtuous entirely of his own merit, not of the gift of grace,”
seems to him “to be a rehabilitation of the general heathen view of the world,” and compares
with it Cicero’s words:5 “For gold, lands, and all the blessings of life, we have to return thanks
to the Gods; but no one ever returned thanks to the Gods for virtues.”6 The struggle with
Pelagianism was thus in reality a struggle for the very foundations of Christianity; and even
more dangerously than in the previous theological and Christological controversies, here
the practical substance of Christianity was in jeopardy. The real question at issue was
whether there was any need for Christianity at all; whether by his own power man might
not attain eternal felicity; whether the function of Christianity was to save, or only to render
an eternity of happiness more easily attainable by man.7</p>
<p>Genetically speaking, Pelagianism was the daughter of legalism; but when it itself conceived,
it brought forth an essential deism. It is not without significance that its originators
were “a certain sort of monks;” that is, laymen of ascetic life. From this point of view the
Divine law is looked upon as a collection of separate commandments, moral perfection as
a simple complex of separate virtues, and a distinct value as a meritorious demand on Divine
approbation is ascribed to each good work or attainment in the exercises of piety. It was
because this was essentially his point of view that Pelagius could regard man’s powers as
sufficient to the attainment of sanctity,—nay, that he could even assert it to be possible for
a man to do more than was required of him. But this involved an essentially deistic conception
of man’s relations to his Maker. God had endowed His creature with a capacity (possibilitas)
or ability (posse) for action, and it was for him to use it. Man was thus a machine, which,
just because it was well made, needed no Divine interference for its right working; and the
Creator, having once framed him, and endowed him with the posse, henceforth leaves the
velle and the esse to him.</p>
<p>At this point we have touched the central and formative principle of Pelagianism. It lies
in the assumption of the plenary ability of man; his ability to do all that righteousness can

demand,—to work out not only his own salvation, but also his own perfection. This is the
core of the whole theory; and all the other postulates not only depend upon it, but arise out
of it. Both chronologically and logically this is the root of the system.</p>
<p>When we first hear of Pelagius, he is already advanced in years, living in Rome in the
odour of sanctity,8 and enjoying a well-deserved reputation for zeal in exhorting others to
a good life, which grew especially warm against those who endeavoured to shelter themselves,
when charged with their sins, behind the weakness of nature.9 He was outraged by the universal
excuses on such occasions,—“It is hard!” “it is difficult!” “we are not able!” “we are
men!”—“Oh, blind madness!” he cried: “we accuse God of a twofold ignorance,—that He
does not seem to know what He has made, nor what He has commanded,—as if forgetting
the human weakness of which He is Himself the Author, He has imposed laws on man
which He cannot endure.”10 He himself tells us11 that it was his custom, therefore,
whenever he had to speak on moral improvement and the conduct of a holy life, to begin
by pointing out the power and quality of human nature, and by showing what it was capable
of doing. For (he says) he esteemed it of small use to exhort men to what they deemed impossible:
hope must rather be our companion, and all longing and effort die when we despair
of attaining. So exceedingly ardent an advocate was he of man’s unaided ability to do all
that God commanded, that when Augustin’s noble and entirely scriptural prayer—“Give
what Thou commandest, and command what Thou wilt”—was repeated in his hearing, he
was unable to endure it; and somewhat inconsistently contradicted it with such violence as
almost to become involved in a strife.12 The powers of man, he held, were gifts of God; and
it was, therefore, a reproach against Him as if He had made man ill or evil, to believe that
they were insufficient for the keeping of His law. Nay, do what we will, we cannot rid
ourselves of their sufficiency: “whether we will, or whether we will not, we have the capacity
of not sinning.”13 “I say,” he says, “that man is able to be without sin, and that he is able to
keep the commandments of God;” and this sufficiently direct statement of human ability is
in reality the hinge of his whole system.</p>
<p>There were three specially important corollaries which flowed from this assertion of
human ability, and Augustin himself recognized these as the chief elements of the system.14
It would be inexplicable on such an assumption, if no man had ever used his ability in

<pb n="15"/>
keeping God’s law; and Pelagius consistently asserted not only that all might be sinless if
they chose, but also that many saints, even before Christ, had actually lived free from sin.
Again, it follows from man’s inalienable ability to be free from sin, that each man comes
into the world without entailment of sin or moral weakness from the past acts of men; and
Pelagius consistently denied the whole doctrine of original sin. And still again, it follows
from the same assumption of ability that man has no need of supernatural assistance in his
striving to obey righteousness; and Pelagius consistently denied both the need and reality
of divine grace in the sense of an inward help (and especially of a prevenient help) to man’s
weakness.</p>
<p>It was upon this last point that the greatest stress was laid in the controversy, and Augustin
was most of all disturbed that thus God’s grace was denied and opposed. No doubt
the Pelagians spoke constantly of “grace,” but they meant by this the primal endowment of
man with free will, and the subsequent aid given him in order to its proper use by the revelation
of the law and the teaching of the gospel, and, above all, by the forgiveness of past sins
in Christ and by Christ’s holy example.15 Anything further than this external help they utterly
denied; and they denied that this external help itself was absolutely necessary, affirming that
it only rendered it easier for man to do what otherwise he had plenary ability for doing.
Chronologically, this contention seems to have preceded the assertion which must logically
lie at its base, of the freedom of man from any taint, corruption, or weakness due to sin. It
was in order that they might deny that man needed help, that they denied that Adam’s sin
had any further effect on his posterity than might arise from his bad example. “Before the
action of his own proper will,” said Pelagius plainly, “that only is in man which God made.”16
“As we are procreated without virtue,” he said, “so also without vice.”17 In a word, “Nothing
that is good and evil, on account of which we are either praiseworthy or blameworthy, is
born with us,—it is rather done by us; for we are born with capacity for either, but provided
with neither.”18 So his later follower, Julian, plainly asserts his “faith that God creates men
obnoxious to no sin, but full of natural innocence, and with capacity for voluntary virtues.”19
So intrenched is free will in nature, that, according to Julian, it is “just as complete after sins
as it was before sins;”20 and what this means may be gathered from Pelagius’ definition in

<pb n="16"/>
the “Confession of Faith,” that he sent to Innocent: “We say that man is always able both
to sin and not to sin, so as that we may confess that we have free will.” That sin in such circumstances
was so common as to be well-nigh universal, was accounted for by the bad exxvi
ample of Adam and the power of habit, the latter being simply the result of imitation of the
former. “Nothing makes well-doing so hard,” writes Pelagius to Demetrias, “as the long
custom of sins which begins from childhood and gradually brings us more and more under
its power until it seems to have in some degree the force of nature (vim naturæ).” He is even
ready to allow for the force of habit in a broad way, on the world at large; and so divides all
history into progressive periods, marked by God’s (external) grace. At first the light of nature
was so strong that men by it alone could live in holiness. And it was only when men’s
manners became corrupt and tarnished nature began to be insufficient for holy living, that
by God’s grace the Law was given as an addition to mere nature; and by it “the original lustre
was restored to nature after its blush had been impaired.” And so again, after the habit of
sinning once more prevailed among men, and “the law became unequal to the task of curing
it,”21 Christ was given, furnishing men with forgiveness of sins, exhortations to imitation
of the example and the holy example itself.22 But though thus a progressive deterioration
was confessed, and such a deterioration as rendered desirable at least two supernatural interpositions
(in the giving of the law and the coming of Christ), yet no corruption of nature,
even by growing habit, is really allowed. It was only an ever-increasing facility in imitating
vice which arose from so long a schooling in evil; and all that was needed to rescue men
from it was a new explanation of what was right (in the law), or, at the most, the encouragement
of forgiveness for what was already done, and a holy example (in Christ) for imitation.
Pelagius still asserted our continuous possession of “a free will which is unimpaired for
sinning and for not sinning;” and Julian, that “our free will is just as full after sins as it was
before sins;” although Augustin does not fail to twit him with a charge of inconsistency.23</p>
<p>The peculiar individualism of the Pelagian view of the world comes out strongly in their
failure to perceive the effect of habit on nature itself. Just as they conceived of virtue as a
complex of virtuous acts, so they conceived of sin exclusively as an act, or series of disconnected
acts. They appear not to have risen above the essentially heathen view which had no
notion of holiness apart from a series of acts of holiness, or of sin apart from a like series of
sinful acts.24 Thus the will was isolated from its acts, and the acts from each other, and all

<note type="footnote">23 The Unfinished Work, i. 91; compare 69.</note>
<note type="footnote">24 Dr. Matheson finely says (Expositor, i. ix. 21), “There is the same difference between the Chrstian and
Pagan idea of prayer as there is between the Christian and Pagan idea of sin. Paganism knows nothing of sin, it
knows only sins: it has no conception of the principle of evil, it comprehends only a succession of sinful acts.”
This is Pelagianism too.</note>

<pb n="17"/>
organic connection or continuity of life was not only overlooked but denied.25 After each
act of the will, man stood exactly where he did before: indeed, this conception scarcely allows
for the existence of a “man”—only a willing machine is left, at each click of the action of
which the spring regains its original position, and is equally ready as before to reperform
its function. In such a conception there was no place for character: freedom of will was all.
Thus it was not an unnatural mistake which they made, when they forgot the man altogether,
and attributed to the faculty of free will, under the name of “possibilitas” or “posse,” the
ability that belonged rather to the man whose faculty it is, and who is properly responsible
for the use he makes of it. Here lies the essential error of their doctrine of free will: they
looked upon freedom in its form only, and not in its matter; and, keeping man in perpetual
and hopeless equilibrium between good and evil, they permitted no growth of character
and no advantage to himself to be gained by man in his successive choices of good. It need
not surprise us that the type of thought which thus dissolved the organism of the man into
a congeries of disconnected voluntary acts, failed to comprehend the solidarity of the race.
To the Pelagian, Adam was a man, nothing more; and it was simply unthinkable that any
act of his that left his own subsequent acts uncommitted, could entail sin and guilt upon
other men. The same alembic that dissolved the individual into a succession of voluntary
acts, could not fail to separate the race into a heap of unconnected units. If sin, as Julian
declared, is nothing but will, and the will itself remained intact after each act, how could
the individual act of an individual will condition the acts of men as yet unborn? By “imitation”
of his act alone could (under such a conception) other men be affected. And this carried
with it the corresponding view of man’s relation to Christ. He could forgive us the sins we
had committed; He could teach us the true way; He could set us a holy example; and He
could exhort us to its imitation. But He could not touch us to enable us to will the good,
without destroying the absolute equilibrium of the will between good and evil; and to destroy
this was to destroy its freedom, which was the crowning good of our divinely created nature.
Surely the Pelagians forgot that man was not made for will, but will for man.</p>
<p>In defending their theory, as we are told by Augustin, there were five claims that they
especially made for it.26 It allowed them to praise as was their due, the creature that God
had made, the marriage that He had instituted, the law that He had given, the free will which
was His greatest endowment to man, and the saints who had followed His counsels. By this
they meant that they proclaimed the sinless perfection of human nature in every man as he
was brought into the world, and opposed this to the doctrine of original sin; the purity and
holiness of marriage and the sexual appetites, and opposed this to the doctrine of the
transmission of sin; the ability of the law, as well as and apart from the gospel, to bring men

<pb n="18"/>
into eternal life, and opposed this to the necessity of inner grace; the integrity of free will to
choose the good, and opposed this to the necessity of divine aid; and the perfection of the
lives of the saints, and opposed this to the doctrine of universal sinfulness. Other questions,
concerning the origin of souls, the necessity of baptism for infants, the original immortality
of Adam, lay more on the skirts of the controversy, and were rather consequences of their
teaching than parts of it. As it was an obvious fact that all men died, they could not admit
that Adam’s death was a consequence of sin lest they should be forced to confess that his
sin had injured all men; they therefore asserted that physical death belonged to the very
nature of man, and that Adam would have died even had he not sinned.27 So, as it was impossible
to deny that the Church everywhere baptized infants, they could not refuse them
baptism without confessing themselves innovators in doctrine; and therefore they contended
that infants were not baptized for forgiveness of sins, but in order to attain a higher state of
salvation. Finally, they conceived that if it was admitted that souls were directly created by
God for each birth, it could not be asserted that they came into the world soiled by sin and
under condemnation; and therefore they loudly championed this theory of the origin of
souls.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Pelagians, it will be readily seen, easily welded themselves into a
system, the essential and formative elements of which were entirely new in the Christian
Church; and this startlingly new reading of man’s condition, powers, and dependence for
salvation, it was, that broke like a thunderbolt upon the Western Church at the opening of
the fifth century, and forced her to reconsider, from the foundations, her whole teaching as
to man and his salvation.</p>

<head>II. The External History of the Pelagian Controversy.</head>
<p>Pelagius seems to have been already somewhat softened by increasing age when he came
to Rome about the opening of the fifth century. He was also constitutionally averse to controversy;
and although in his zeal for Christian morals, and in his conviction that no man
would attempt to do what he was not persuaded he had natural power to perform, he diligently
propagated his doctrines privately, he was careful to rouse no opposition, and was
content to make what progress he could quietly and without open discussion. His methods
of work sufficiently appear in the pages of his “Commentary on the Epistles of Saint Paul,”
which was written and published during these years, and which exhibits learning and a sober
and correct but somewhat shallow exegetical skill. In this work, he manages to give expression
to all the main elements of his system, but always introduces them indirectly, not as the true
exegesis, but by way of objections to the ordinary teaching, which were in need of discussion.
The most important fruit of his residence in Rome was the conversion to his views of the
Advocate Coelestius, who brought the courage of youth and the argumentative training of
a lawyer to the propagation of the new teaching. It was through him that it first broke out
into public controversy, and received its first ecclesiastical examination and rejection.
Fleeing from Alaric’s second raid on Rome, the two friends landed together in Africa (A.D.
411), whence Pelagius soon afterwards departed for Palestine, leaving the bolder and more
contentious28 Coelestius behind at Carthage. Here Coelestius sought ordination as a presbyter.
But the Milanese deacon Paulinus stood forward in accusation of him as a heretic, and the
matter was brought before a synod under the presidency of Bishop Aurelius.29</p>
<p>Paulinus’ charge consisted of seven items,30 which asserted that Coelestius taught the
following heresies: that Adam was made mortal, and would have died, whether he sinned
or did not sin; that the sin of Adam injured himself alone, not the human race; that newborn
children are in that state in which Adam was before his sin; that the whole human race
does not, on the one hand, die on account of the death or the fall of Adam, nor, on the
other, rise again on account of the resurrection of Christ; that infants, even though not
baptized, have eternal life; that the law leads to the kingdom of heaven in the same way as
the gospel; and that, even before the Lord’s coming, there had been men without sin. Only
two fragments of the proceedings of the synod in investigating this charge have come down
to us;31 but it is easy to see that Coelestius was contumacious, and refused to reject any of

<pb n="20"/>
the propositions charged against him, except the one which had reference to the salvation
of infants that die unbaptized,—the sole one that admitted of sound defence. As touching
the transmission of sin, he would only say that it was an open question in the Church, and
that he had heard both opinions from Church dignitaries; so that the subject needed investigation,
and should not be made the ground for a charge of heresy. The natural result was,
that, on refusing to condemn the propositions charged against him, he was himself condemned
and excommunicated by the synod. Soon afterwards he sailed to Ephesus, where
he obtained the ordination which he sought.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Pelagius was living quietly in Palestine, whither in the summer of 415 a
young Spanish presbyter, Paulus Orosius by name, came with letters from Augustin to
Jerome, and was invited, near the end of July in that year, to a diocesan synod, presided over
by John of Jerusalem. There he was asked about Pelagius and Coelestius, and proceeded to
give an account of the condemnation of the latter at the synod of Carthage, and of Augustin’s
literary refutation of the former. Pelagius was sent for, and the proceedings became an examination
into his teachings. The chief matter brought up was his assertion of the possibility
of men living sinlessly in this world; but the favour of the bishop towards him, the intemperance
of Orosius, and the difficulty of communication between the parties arising from
difference of language, combined so to clog proceedings that nothing was done; and the
whole matter, as Western in its origin, was referred to the Bishop of Rome for examination
and decision.32</p>
<p>Soon afterwards two Gallic bishops,—Heros of Arles, and Lazarus of Aix,—who were
then in Palestine, lodged a formal accusation against Pelagius with the metropolitan, Eulogius
of Cæsarea; and he convened a synod of fourteen bishops which met at Lydda
(Diospolis), in December of the same year (415), for the trial of the case. Perhaps no greater
ecclesiastical farce was ever enacted than this synod exhibited.33 When the time arrived,
the accusers were prevented from being present by illness, and Pelagius was confronted only
by the written accusation. This was both unskilfully drawn, and was written in Latin which
the synod did not understand. It was, therefore, not even consecutively read, and was only
head by head rendered into Greek by an interpreter. Pelagius began by reading aloud several
letters to himself from various men of reputation in the Episcopate,—among them a friendly
note from Augustin. Thoroughly acquainted with both Latin and Greek, he was enabled
skillfully to thread every difficulty, and pass safely through the ordeal. Jerome called this a
“miserable synod,” and not unjustly: at the same time it is sufficient to vindicate the honesty
and earnestness of the bishops’ intentions, that even in such circumstances, and despite the
more undeveloped opinions of the East on the questions involved, Pelagius escaped condem-

<pb n="21"/>
nation only by a course of most ingenious disingenuousness, and only at the cost both of
disowning Coelestius and his teachings, of which he had been the real father, and of leading
the synod to believe that he was anathematizing the very doctrines which he was himself
proclaiming. There is really no possibility of doubting, as any one will see who reads the
proceedings of the synod, that Pelagius obtained his acquittal here either by a “lying condemnation
or a tricky interpretation” 34 of his own teachings; and Augustin is perfectly
justified in asserting that the “heresy was not acquitted, but the man who denied the heresy,”35
and who would himself have been anathematized had he not anathematized the heresy.</p>
<p>However obtained, the acquittal of Pelagius was yet an accomplished fact. Neither he
nor his friends delayed to make the most widely extended use of their good fortune. Pelagius
himself was jubilant. Accounts of the synodal proceedings were sent to the West, not altogether
free from uncandid alterations; and Pelagius soon put forth a work In Defence of
Free-Will, in which he triumphed in his acquittal and “explained his explanations” at the
synod. Nor were the champions of the opposite opinion idle. As soon as the news arrived
in North Africa, and before the authentic records of the synod had reached that region, the
condemnation of Pelagius and Coelestius was re-affirmed in two provincial synods,—one,
consisting of sixty-eight bishops, met at Carthage about midsummer of 416; and the other,
consisting of about sixty bishops, met soon afterwards at Mileve (Mila). Thus Palestine and
North Africa were arrayed against one another, and it became of great importance to obtain
the support of the Patriarchal See of Rome. Both sides made the attempt, but fortune favored
the Africans. Each of the North-African synods sent a synodal letter to Innocent I., then
Bishop of Rome, engaging his assent to their action: to these, five bishops, Aurelius of
Carthage and Augustin among them, added a third “familiar” letter of their own, in which
they urged upon Innocent to examine into Pelagius’ teaching, and provided him with the
material on which he might base a decision. The letters reached Innocent in time for him
to take advice of his clergy, and send favorable replies on Jan. 27, 417. In these he expressed
his agreement with the African decisions, asserted the necessity of inward grace, rejected
the Pelagian theory of infant baptism, and declared Pelagius and Coelestius excommunicated
until they should return to orthodoxy. In about six weeks more he was dead: but Zosimus,
his successor, was scarcely installed in his place before Coelestius appeared at Rome in person
to plead his cause; while shortly afterwards letters arrived from Pelagius addressed to Innocent,
and by an artful statement of his belief and a recommendation from Praylus, lately
become bishop of Jerusalem in John’s stead, attempting to enlist Rome in his favour. Zosimus,
who appears to have been a Greek and therefore inclined to make little of the merits of this
Western controversy, went over to Coelestius at once, upon his profession of willingness to

<pb n="22"/>
anathematize all doctrines which the pontifical see had condemned or should condemn;
and wrote a sharp and arrogant letter to Africa, proclaiming Coelestius “catholic,” and requiring
the Africans to appear within two months at Rome to prosecute their charges, or
else to abandon them. On the arrival of Pelagius’ papers, this letter was followed by another
(September, 417), in which Zosimus, with the approbation of the clergy, declared both
Pelagius and Coelestius to be orthodox, and severely rebuked the Africans for their hasty
judgment. It is difficult to understand Zosimus’ action in this matter: neither of the confessions
presented by the accused teachers ought to have deceived him, and if he was seizing
the occasion to magnify the Roman see, his mistake was dreadful. Late in 417, or early in
418, the African bishops assembled at Carthage, in number more than two hundred, and
replied to Zosimus that they had decided that the sentence pronounced against Pelagius
and Coelestius should remain in force until they should unequivocally acknowledge that
“we are aided by the grace of God, through Christ, not only to know, but to do what is right,
in each single act, so that without grace we are unable to have, think, speak, or do anything
pertaining to piety.” This firmness made Zosimus waver. He answered swellingly but timidly,
declaring that he had maturely examined the matter, but it had not been his intention finally
to acquit Coelestius; and now he had left all things in the condition in which they were before,
but he claimed the right of final judgment to himself. Matters were hastening to a conclusion,
however, that would leave him no opportunity to escape from the mortification of an entire
change of front. This letter was written on the 21st of March, 418; it was received in Africa
on the 29th of April; and on the very next day an imperial decree was issued from Ravenna
ordering Pelagius and Coelestius to be banished from Rome, with all who held their opinions;
while on the next day, May 1, a plenary council of about two hundred bishops met at
Carthage, and in nine canons condemned all the essential features of Pelagianism. Whether
this simultaneous action was the result of skillful arrangement, can only be conjectured: its
effect was in any case necessarily crushing. There could be no appeal from the civil decision,
and it played directly into the hands of the African definition of the faith. The synod’s nine
canons part naturally into three triads.36 The first of these deals with the relation of mankind
to original sin, and anathematizes in turn those who assert that physical death is a necessity
of nature, and not a result of Adam’s sin; those who assert that new-born children derive
nothing of original sin from Adam to be expiated by the laver of regeneration; and those
who assert a distinction between the kingdom of heaven and eternal life, for entrance into
the former of which alone baptism is necessary. The second triad deals with the nature of
grace, and anathematizes those who assert that grace brings only remission of past sins, not
aid in avoiding future ones; those who assert that grace aids us not to sin, only by teaching
us what is sinful, not by enabling us to will and do what we know to be right; and those whof
<note type="footnote">36 Compare Canon Bright’s Introduction in his Select Anti-Pelagian Treatises, p. xli.</note>

<pb n="23"/>
assert that grace only enables us to do more easily what we should without it still be able to
do. The third triad deals with the universal sinfulness of the race, and anathematizes those
who assert that the apostles’ (1 John i. 8) confession of sin is due only to their humility;
those who say that “Forgive us our trespasses” in the Lord’s Prayer, is pronounced by the
saints, not for themselves, but for the sinners in their company; and those who say that the
saints use these words of themselves only out of humility and not truly. Here we see a careful
traversing of the whole ground of the controversy, with a conscious reference to the three
chief contentions of the Pelagian teachers.37</p>
<p>The appeal to the civil power, by whomsoever made, was, of course, indefensible, although
it accorded with the opinions of the day, and was entirely approved by Augustin.
But it was the ruin of the Pelagian cause. Zosimus found himself forced either to go into
banishment with his wards, or to desert their cause. He appears never to have had any personal
convictions on the dogmatic points involved in the controversy, and so, all the more
readily, yielded to the necessity of the moment. He cited Coelestius to appear before a
council for a new examination; but that heresiarch consulted prudence, and withdrew from
the city. Zosimus, possibly in the effort to appear a leader in the cause he had opposed, not
only condemned and excommunicated the men whom less than six months before he had
pronounced “orthodox” after a ‘mature consideration of the matters involved,’ but, in
obedience to the imperial decree, issued a stringent paper which condemned Pelagius and
the Pelagians, and affirmed the African doctrines as to corruption of nature, true grace, and
the necessity of baptism. To this he required subscription from all bishops as a test of orthodoxy.
Eighteen Italian bishops refused their signature, with Julian of Eclanum, henceforth
to be the champion of the Pelagian party, at their head, and were therefore deposed, although
several of them afterwards recanted, and were restored. In Julian, the heresy obtained an
advocate, who, if aught could have been done for its re-instatement, would surely have
proved successful. He was the boldest, the strongest, at once the most acute and the most
weighty, of all the disputants of his party. But the ecclesiastical standing of this heresy was
already determined. The policy of Zosimus’ test act was imposed by imperial authority on
North Africa in 419. The exiled bishops were driven from Constantinople by Atticus in 424;
and they are said to have been condemned at a Cilician synod in 423, and at an Antiochian
one in 424. Thus the East itself was preparing for the final act in the drama. The exiled
bishops were with Nestorius at Constantinople in 429; and that patriarch unsuccessfully
interceded for them with Coelestine, then Bishop of Rome. The conjunction was ominous.
And at the ecumenical synod at Ephesus in 431, we again find the “Coelestians” side by side
with Nestorius, sharers in his condemnation.</p>
<note type="footnote">37 See above, p. xv., and the passages in Augustin cited in note 3.</note>

<pb n="24"/>
<p>But Pelagianism did not so die as not to leave a legacy behind it. “Remainders of Pelagianism”
38 soon showed themselves in Southern Gaul, where a body of monastic leaders attempted
to find a middle ground on which they could stand, by allowing the Augustinian
doctrine of assisting grace, but retaining the Pelagian conception of our self-determination
to good. We first hear of them in 428, through letters from two laymen, Prosper and Hilary,
to Augustin, as men who accepted original sin and the necessity of grace, but asserted that
men began their turning to God, and God helped their beginning. They taught39 that all
men are sinners, and that they derive their sin from Adam; that they can by no means save
themselves, but need God’s assisting grace; and that this grace is gratuitous in the sense that
men cannot really deserve it, and yet that it is not irresistible, nor given always without the
occasion of its gift having been determined by men’s attitude towards God; so that, though
not given on account of the merits of men, it is given according to those merits, actual or
foreseen. The leader of this new movement was John Cassian, a pupil of Chrysostom (to
whom he attributed all that was good in his life and will), and the fountain-head of Gallic
monasticism; and its chief champion at a somewhat later day was Faustus of Rhegium (Riez).</p>
<p>The Augustinian opposition was at first led by the vigorous controversialist, Prosper of
Aquitaine, and, in the next century, by the wise, moderate, and good Cæsarius of Arles, who
brought the contest to a conclusion in the victory of a softened Augustinianism. Already in
431 a letter was obtained from Pope Coelestine, designed to close the controversy in favor
of Augustinianism, and in 496 Pope Gelasius condemned the writings of Faustus in the first
index of forbidden books; while, near the end of the first quarter of the sixth century, Pope
Hormisdas was appealed to for a renewed condemnation. The end was now in sight. The
famous second Synod of Orange met under the presidency of Cæsarius at that ancient town
on the 3d of July, 529, and drew up a series of moderate articles which received the ratification
of Boniface II. in the following year. In these articles there is affirmed an anxiously guarded
Augustinianism, a somewhat weakened Augustinianism, but yet a distinctive Augustinianism;
and, so far as a formal condemnation could reach, semi-Pelagianism was suppressed by
them in the whole Western Church. But councils and popes can only decree; and Cassian
and Vincent and Faustus, despite Cæsarius and Boniface and Gregory, retained an influence
among their countrymen which never died away.</p>

<head>III. Augustin’s Part in the Controversy.</head>
<p>Both by nature and by grace, Augustin was formed to be the champion of truth in this
controversy. Of a naturally philosophical temperament, he saw into the springs of life with
a vividness of mental perception to which most men are strangers; and his own experiences
in his long life of resistance to, and then of yielding to, the drawings of God’s grace, gave
him a clear apprehension of the great evangelic principle that God seeks men, not men God,
such as no sophistry could cloud. However much his philosophy or theology might undergo
change in other particulars, there was one conviction too deeply imprinted upon his heart
ever to fade or alter,—the conviction of the ineffableness of God’s grace. Grace,—man’s
absolute dependence on God as the source of all good,—this was the common, nay, the
formative element, in all stages of his doctrinal development, which was marked only by the
ever growing consistency with which he built his theology around this central principle.
Already in 397,—the year after he became bishop,—we find him enunciating with admirable
clearness all the essential elements of his teaching, as he afterwards opposed them to Pelagius.
40 It was inevitable, therefore, that although he was rejoiced when he heard, some years
later, of the zealous labours of this pious monk in Rome towards stemming the tide of luxury
and sin, and esteemed him for his devout life, and loved him for his Christian activity, he
yet was deeply troubled when subsequent rumours reached him that he was “disputing
against the grace of God.” He tells us over and over again, that this was a thing no pious
heart could endure; and we perceive that, from this moment, Augustin was only biding his
time, and awaiting a fitting opportunity to join issue with the denier of the Holy of holies
of his whole, I will not say theology merely, but life. “Although I was grieved by this,” he
says, “and it was told me by men whom I believed, I yet desired to have something of such
sort from his own lips or in some book of his, so that, if I began to refute it, he would not
be able to deny it.”41 Thus he actually excuses himself for not entering into the controversy
earlier. When Pelagius came to Africa, then, it was almost as if he had deliberately sought
his fate. But circumstances secured a lull before the storm. He visited Hippo; but Augustin
was absent, although he did not fail to inform himself on his return that Pelagius while there
had not been heard to say “anything at all of this kind.” The controversy against the
Donatists was now occupying all the energies of the African Church, and Augustin himself
was a ruling spirit in the great conference now holding at Carthage with them. While there,
he was so immersed in this business, that, although he once or twice saw the face of Pelagius,
he had no conversation with him; and although his ears were wounded by a casual remark
which he heard, to the effect “that infants were not baptized for remission of sins, but for

<pb n="26"/>
consecration to Christ,” he allowed himself to pass over the matter, “because there was no
opportunity to contradict it, and those who said it were not such men as could cause him
solicitude for their influence.”42</p>
<p>It appears from these facts, given us by himself, that Augustin was not only ready for,
but was looking for, the coming controversy. It can scarcely have been a surprise to him
when Paulinus accused Coelestius (412); and, although he was not a member of the council
which condemned him, it was inevitable that he should at once take the leading part in the
consequent controversy. Coelestius and his friends did not silently submit to the judgment
that had been passed upon their teaching: they could not openly propagate their heresy, but
they were diligent in spreading their plaints privately and by subterraneous whispers among
the people.43 This was met by the Catholics in public sermons and familiar colloquies held
everywhere. But this wise rule was observed,—to contend against the erroneous teachings,
but to keep silence as to the teachers, that so (as Augustin explains44) “the men might rather
be brought to see and acknowledge their error through fear of ecclesiastical judgment than
be punished by the actual judgment.” Augustin was abundant in these oral labours; and
many of his sermons directed against Pelagian error have come down to us, although it is
often impossible to be sure as to their date. For one of them (170) he took his text from Phil.
iii. 6–16, “as touching the righteousness which is by the law blameless; howbeit what things
were gain to me, those have I counted loss for Christ.” He begins by asking how the apostle
could count his blameless conversation according to the righteousness which is from the
law as dung and loss, and then proceeds to explain the purpose for which the law was given,
our state by nature and under law, and the kind of blamelessness that the law could produce,
ending by showing that man can have no righteousness except from God, and no perfect
righteousness except in heaven. Three others (174, 175, 176) had as their text 1 Tim. i. 15,
16, and developed its teaching, that the universal sin of the world and its helplessness in sin
constituted the necessity of the incarnation; and especially that the necessity of Christ’s
grace for salvation was just as great for infants as for adults. Much is very forcibly said in
these sermons which was afterwards incorporated in his treatises. “There was no reason,”
he insists, “for the coming of Christ the Lord except to save sinners. Take away diseases,
take away wounds, and there is no reason for medicine. If the great Physician came from
heaven, a great sick man was lying ill through the whole world. That sick man is the human
race” (175, 1). “He who says, ‘I am not a sinner,’ or ‘I was not,’ is ungrateful to the Saviour.
No one of men in that mass of mortals which flows down from Adam, no one at all of men
is not sick: no one is healed without the grace of Christ. Why do you ask whether infants

<pb n="27"/>
are sick from Adam? For they, too, are brought to the church; and, if they cannot run
thither on their own feet, they run on the feet of others that they may be healed. Mother
Church accommodates others’ feet to them so that they may come, others’ heart so that they
may believe, others’ tongue so that they may confess; and, since they are sick by another’s
sin, so when they are healed they are saved by another’s confession in their behalf. Let, then,
no one buzz strange doctrines to you. This the Church has always had, has always held; this
she has received from the faith of the elders; this she will perseveringly guard until the end.
Since the whole have no need of a physician, but only the sick, what need, then, has the infant
of Christ, if he is not sick? If he is well, why does he seek the physician through those who
love him? If, when infants are brought, they are said to have no sin of inheritance (peccatum
propaginis) at all, and yet come to Christ, why is it not said in the church to those that bring
them, ‘take these innocents hence; the physician is not needed by the well, but by the sick;
Christ came not to call the just, but sinners’? It never has been said, and it never will be said.
Let each one therefore, brethren, speak for him who cannot speak for himself. It is much
the custom to intrust the inheritance of orphans to the bishops; how much more the grace
of infants! The bishop protects the orphan lest he should be oppressed by strangers, his
parents being dead. Let him cry out more for the infant who, he fears, will be slain by his
parents. Who comes to Christ has something in him to be healed; and he who has not, has
no reason for seeking the physician. Let parents choose one of two things: let them either
confess that there is sin to be healed in their infants, or let them cease bringing them to the
physician. This is nothing else than to wish to bring a well person to the physician. Why do
you bring him? To be baptized. Whom? The infant. To whom do you bring him? To Christ.
To Him, of course, who came into the world? Certainly, he says. Why did He come into the
world? To save sinners. Then he whom you bring has in him that which needs saving?”45
So again: “He who says that the age of infancy does not need Jesus’ salvation, says nothing
else than that the Lord Christ is not Jesus to faithful infants; i.e., to infants baptized in Christ.
For what is Jesus? Jesus means saviour. He is not Jesus to those whom He does not save, who
do not need to be saved. Now, if your hearts can bear that Christ is not Jesus to any of the
baptized, I do not know how you can be acknowledged to have sound faith. They are infants,
but they are made members of Him. They are infants, but they receive His sacraments. They
are infants, but they become partakers of His table, so that they may have life.”46 The preveniency
of grace is explicitly asserted in these sermons. In one he says, “Zaccheus was seen,
and saw; but unless he had been seen, he would not have seen. For ‘whom He predestinated,
them also He called.’ In order that we may see, we are seen; that we may love, we are loved.
‘My God, may His pity prevent me!’”47 And in another, at more length: “His calling has

<pb n="28"/>
preceded you, so that you may have a good will. Cry out, ‘My God, let Thy mercy prevent
me’ (Ps. lviii. 11). That you may be, that you may feel, that you may hear, that you may
consent, His mercy prevents you. It prevents you in all things; and do you too prevent His
judgment in something. In what, do you say? In what? In confessing that you have all these
things from God, whatever you have of good; and from yourself whatever you have of evil”
(176, 5). “We owe therefore to Him that we are, that we are alive, that we understand: that
we are men, that we live well, that we understand aright, we owe to Him. Nothing is ours
except the sin that we have. For what have we that we did not receive?” (1 Cor. ix. 7) (176,
6).</p>
<p>It was not long, however, before the controversy was driven out of the region of sermons
into that of regular treatises. The occasion for Augustin’s first appearance in a written document
bearing on the controversy, was given by certain questions which were sent to him
for answer by “the tribune and notary” Marcellinus, with whom he had cemented his intimacy
at Carthage, the previous year, when this notable official was presiding, by the emperor’s
orders, over the great conference of the catholics and Donatists. The mere fact that Marcellinus,
still at Carthage, where Coelestius had been brought to trial, wrote to Augustin at
Hippo for written answers to important questions connected with the Pelagian heresy,
speaks volumes for the prominent position he had already assumed in the controversy. The
questions that were sent, concerned the connection of death with sin, the transmission of
sin, the possibility of a sinless life, and especially infants’ need of baptism.48 Augustin was
immersed in abundant labours when they reached him:49 but he could not resist this appeal,
and that the less as the Pelagian controversy had already grown to a place of the first importance
in his eyes. The result was his treatise, On the Merits and Remission of Sins and on the
Baptism of Infants, consisting of two books, and written in 412. The first book of this work
is an argument for original sin, drawn from the universal reign of death in the world (2–8),
from the teaching of Rom. v. 12–21 (9–20), and chiefly from the baptism of infants (21–70).50
It opens by exploding the Pelagian contention that death is of nature, and Adam would have
died even had he not sinned, by showing that the penalty threatened to Adam included
physical death (Gen. iii. 19), and that it is due to him that we all die (Rom. viii. 10, 11; 1 Cor.
xv. 21) (2–8). Then the Pelagian assertion that we are injured in Adam’s sin only by its bad
example, which we imitate, not by any propagation from it, is tested by an exposition of
<note type="footnote">48 On the Merits and Remission of Sins, iii. 1.</note>

<note type="footnote">50 On the prominence of infant baptism in the controversy, and why it was so, see Sermon 165, 7 sq. “What
do you say? ‘Just this,’ he says, ‘that God creates every man immortal.’ Why, then do infant children die? For if
I say, ‘Why do adult men die?’ you would say to me, ‘They have sinned.’ Therefore I do not argue about the
adults: I cite infancy as a witness against you,” and so on, eloquently developing the argument.</note>

<pb n="29"/>
Rom. v. 12 sq. (9–20). And then the main subject of the book is reached, and the writer
sharply presses the Pelagians with the universal and primeval fact of the baptism of infants,
as a proof of original sin (21–70). He tracks out all their subterfuges,—showing the absurdity
of the assertions that infants are baptized for the remission of sins that they have themselves
committed since birth (22), or in order to obtain a higher stage of salvation (23–28), or because
of sin committed in some previous state of existence (31–33). Then turning to the
positive side, he shows at length that the Scriptures teach that Christ came to save sinners,
that baptism is for the remission of sins, and that all that partake of it are confessedly sinners
(34 sq.); then he points out that John ii. 7, 8, on which the Pelagians relied, cannot be held
to distinguish between ordinary salvation and a higher form, under the name of “the kingdom
of God” (58 sq.); and he closes by showing that the very manner in which baptism was administered,
with its exorcism and exsufflation, implied the infant to be a sinner (63), and
by suggesting that the peculiar helplessness of infancy, so different not only from the earliest
age of Adam, but also from that of many young animals, may possibly be itself penal (64–69).
The second book treats, with similar fulness, the question of the perfection of human
righteousness in this life. After an exordium which speaks of the will and its limitations,
and of the need of God’s assisting grace (1–6), the writer raises four questions. First,
whether it may be said to be possible, by God’s grace, for a man to attain a condition of entire
sinlessness in this life (7). This he answers in the affirmative. Secondly, he asks, whether any
one has ever done this, or may ever be expected to do it, and answers in the negative on the
testimony of Scripture (8–25). Thirdly, he asks why not, and replies briefly because men are
unwilling, explaining at length what he means by this (26–33). Finally, he inquires whether
any man has ever existed, exists now, or will ever exist, entirely without sin,—this question
differing from the second inasmuch as that asked after the attainment in this life of a state
in which sinning should cease, while this seeks a man who has never been guilty of sin, implying
the absence of original as well as of actual sin. After answering this in the negative
(34), Augustin discusses anew the question of original sin. Here after expounding from the
positive side (35–38) the condition of man in paradise, the nature of his probation, and of
the fall and its effects both on him and his posterity, and the kind of redemption that has
been provided in the incarnation, he proceeds to answer certain cavils (39 sq.), such as,
“Why should children of baptized people need baptism?”—“How can a sin be remitted to
the father and held against the child?”—“If physical death comes from Adam, ought we not
to be released from it on believing in Christ?”—and concludes with an exhortation to hold
fast to the exact truth, turning neither to the right nor left,—neither saying that we have no
sin, nor surrendering ourselves to our sin (57 sq.).</p>
<p>After these books were completed, Augustin came into possession of Pelagius’ Commentary
on Paul’s Epistles, which was written while he was living in Rome (before 410), and
found it to contain some arguments that he had not treated,—such arguments, he tells us,

<pb n="30"/>
as he had not imagined could be held by any one.51 Unwilling to re-open his finished argument,
he now began a long supplementary letter to Marcellinus, which he intended to serve
as a third and concluding book to his work. He was some time in completing this letter. He
had asked to have the former two books returned to him; and it is a curious indication of
his overworked state of mind, that he forgot what he wanted with them:52 he visited Carthage
while the letter was in hand, and saw Marcellinus personally; and even after his return to
Hippo, it dragged along, amid many distractions, slowly towards completion.53 Meanwhile,
a long letter was written to Honoratus, in which a section on the grace of the New Testament
was incorporated. At length the promised supplement was completed. It was professedly a
criticism of Pelagius’ Commentary, and therefore naturally mentioned his name; but Augustin
even goes out of his way to speak as highly of his opponent as he can,54—although it is apparent
that his esteem is not very high for his strength of mind, and is even less high for the
moral quality that led to his odd, oblique way of expressing his opinions. There is even a
half sarcasm in the way he speaks of Pelagius’ care and circumspection, which was certainly
justified by the event. The letter opens by stating and criticising in a very acute and telling
dialectic, the new arguments of Pelagius, which were such as the following: “If Adam’s sin
injured even those who do not sin, Christ’s righteousness ought likewise to profit even those
who do not believe” (2–4); “No man can transmit what he has not; and hence, if baptism
cleanses from sin, the children of baptized parents ought to be free from sin;” “God remits
one’s own sins, and can scarcely, therefore, impute another’s to us; and if the soul is created,
it would certainly be unjust to impute Adam’s alien sin to it” (5). The stress of the letter,
however, is laid upon two contentions,—1. That whatever else may be ambiguous in the
Scriptures, they are perfectly clear that no man can have eternal life except in Christ, who
came to call sinners to repentance (7); and 2. That original sin in infants has always been,
in the Church, one of the fixed facts, to be used as a basis of argument, in order to reach the
truth in other matters, and has never itself been called in question before (10–14). At this
point, the writer returns to the second and third of the new arguments of Pelagius mentioned
above, and discusses them more fully (15–20), closing with a recapitulation of the three
great points that had been raised; viz., that both death and sin are derived from Adam’s sin
by all his posterity; that infants need salvation, and hence baptism; and that no man ever
attains in this life such a state of holiness that he cannot truly pray, “Forgive us our trespasses.”</p>

<pb n="31"/>
<p>Augustin was now to learn that one service often entails another. Marcellinus wrote to
say that he was puzzled by what had been said in the second book of this work, as to the
possibility of man’s attaining to sinlessness in this life, while yet it was asserted that no man
ever had attained, or ever would attain, it. How, he asked, can that be said to be possible
which is, and which will remain, unexampled? In reply, Augustin wrote, during this same
year (412), and sent to his noble friend, another work, which he calls On the Spirit and the
Letter, from the prominence which he gives in it to the words of 2 Cor. iii. 6.55 He did not
content himself with a simple, direct answer to Marcellinus’ question, but goes at length
into a profound disquisition into the roots of the doctrine, and thus gives us, not a mere
explanation of a former contention, but a new treatise on a new subject,—the absolute necessity
of the grace of God for any good living. He begins by explaining to Marcellinus that
he has affirmed the possibility while denying the actuality of a sinless life, on the ground
that all things are possible to God,—even the passage of a camel through the eye of a needle,
which nevertheless has never occurred (1, 2). For, in speaking of man’s perfection, we are
speaking really of a work of God,—and one which is none the less His work because it is
wrought through the instrumentality of man, and in the use of his free will. The Scriptures,
indeed, teach that no man lives without sin, but this is only the proclamation of a matter of
fact; and although it is thus contrary to fact and Scripture to assert that men may be found
that live sinlessly, yet such an assertion would not be fatal heresy. What is unbearable, is
that men should assert it to be possible for man, unaided by God, to attain this perfection.
This is to speak against the grace of God: it is to put in man’s power what is only possible
to the almighty grace of God (3, 4). No doubt, even these men do not, in so many words,
exclude the aid of grace in perfecting human life,—they affirm God’s help; but they make
it consist in His gift to man of a perfectly free will, and in His addition to this of commandments
and teachings which make known to him what he is to seek and what to avoid, and
so enable him to direct his free will to what is good. What, however, does such a “grace”
amount to? (5). Man needs something more than to know the right way: he needs to love
it, or he will not walk in it; and all mere teaching, which can do nothing more than bring
us knowledge of what we ought to do, is but the letter that killeth. What we need is some
inward, Spirit-given aid to the keeping of what by the law we know ought to be kept. Mere
knowledge slays: while to lead a holy life is the gift of God,—not only because He has given
us will, nor only because He has taught us the right way, but because by the Holy Spirit He
sheds love abroad in the hearts of all those whom He has predestinated, and will call and
justify and glorify (Rom. viii. 29, 30). To prove this, he states to be the object of the present
treatise; and after investigating the meaning of 2 Cor. iii. 6, and showing that “the letter”
there means the law as a system of precepts, which reveals sin rather than takes it away,
<note type="footnote">55 Sermon 163 treats the text similarly.</note>

<pb n="32"/>
points out the way rather than gives strength to walk in it, and therefore slays the soul by
shutting it up under sin,—while “the Spirit” is God’s Holy Ghost who is shed abroad in our
hearts to give us strength to walk aright,—he undertakes to prove this position from the
teachings of the Epistle to the Romans at large. This contention, it will be seen, cut at the
very roots of Pelagianism: if all mere teaching slays the soul, as Paul asserts, then all that
what they called “grace” could, when alone, do, was to destroy; and the upshot of “helping”
man by simply giving him free will, and pointing out the way to him, would be the loss of
the whole race. Not that the law is sin: Augustin teaches that it is holy and good, and God’s
instrument in salvation. Not that free will is done away: it is by free will that men are led
into holiness. But the purpose of the law (he teaches) is to make men so feel their lost estate
as to seek the help by which alone they may be saved; and will is only then liberated to do
good when grace has made it free. “What the law of works enjoins by menace, that the law
of faith secures by faith. What the law of works does is to say, ‘Do what I command thee;’
but by the law of faith we say to God, ‘Give me what thou commandest.’”(22).56 In the midst
of this argument, Augustin is led to discuss the differentiating characteristics of the Old and
New Testaments; and he expounds at length (33–42) the passage in Jer. xxxi. 31–34, showing
that, in the prophet’s view, the difference between the two covenants is that in the Old, the
law is an external thing written on stones; while in the New, it is written internally on the
heart, so that men now wish to do what the law prescribes. This writing on the heart is
nothing else, he explains, than the shedding abroad by the Holy Spirit of love in our hearts,
so that we love God’s will, and therefore freely do it. Towards the end of the treatise (50–61),
he treats in an absorbingly interesting way of the mutual relations of free will, faith, and
grace, contending that all co-exist without the voiding of any. It is by free will that we believe;
but it is only as grace moves us, that we are able to use our free will for believing; and it is
only after we are thus led by grace to believe, that we obtain all other goods. In prosecuting
this analysis, Augustin is led to distinguish very sharply between the faculty and use of free
will (58), as well as between ability and volition (53). Faith is an act of the man himself; but
only as he is given the power from on high to will to believe, will he believe (57, 60).</p>
<p>By this work, Augustin completed, in his treatment of Pelagianism, the circle of that
triad of doctrines which he himself looked upon as most endangered by this
heresy,57—original sin, the imperfection of human righteousness, the necessity of grace. In
his mind, the last was the kernel of the whole controversy; and this was a subject which he
could never approach without some heightened fervour. This accounts for the great attractiveness
of the present work,—through the whole fabric of which runs the golden thread of
the praise of God’s ineffable grace. In Canon Bright’s opinion, it “perhaps, next to the
<note type="footnote">56 See this prayer beautifully illustrated from Scripture in On the Merits and Remission of Sins, ii. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">57 See above, p. xv.</note>

<pb n="33"/>
‘Confessions,’ tells us most of the thoughts of that ‘rich, profound, and affectionate mind’
on the soul’s relations to its God.”58</p>
<p>After the publication of these treatises, the controversy certainly did not lull; but it relapsed
for nearly three years again, into less public courses. Meanwhile, Augustin was busy,
among other most distracting cares (Ep. 145, 1), still defending the grace of God, by letters
and sermons. A fair illustration of his state of mind at this time, may be obtained from his
letter to Anastasius (145), which assuredly must have been written soon after the treatise
On the Spirit and the Letter. Throughout this letter, there are adumbrations of the same
train of thought that filled this treatise; and there is one passage which may almost be taken
as a summary of it. Augustin is so weary of the vexatious cares that filled his life, that he is
ready to long for the everlasting rest, and yet bewails the weakness which allowed the
sweetness of external things still to insinuate itself into his heart. Victory over, and emancipation
from, this, he asserts, “cannot, without God’s grace, be achieved by the human will,
which is by no means to be called free so long as it is subject to enslaving lusts.” Then he
proceeds: “The law, therefore, by teaching and commanding what cannot be fulfilled without
grace, demonstrates to man his weakness, in order that the weakness, thus proved, may resort
to the Saviour, by whose healing the will may be able to do what it found impossible in its
weakness. So, then, the law brings us to faith, faith obtains the Spirit in fuller measure, the
Spirit sheds love abroad in us, and love fulfils the law. For this reason the law is called a
schoolmaster, under whose threatening and severity ‘whosoever shall call on the name of
the Lord shall be delivered.’ But ‘how shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?’
Wherefore, that the letter without the Spirit may not kill, the life-giving Spirit is given to
those that believe and call upon Him; but the love of God is poured out into our hearts by
the Holy Spirit who is given to us, so that the words of the same apostle, ‘Love is the fulfilling
of the law,’ may be realized. Thus the law is good to him that uses it lawfully; and he uses it
lawfully, who, understanding wherefore it was given, betakes himself, under the pressure
of its threatening, to liberating grace. Whoever ungratefully despises this grace by which
the ungodly is justified, and trusts in his own strength for fulfilling the law, being ignorant
of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish his own righteousness, is not submitting
himself to the righteousness of God; and therefore the law is made to him not a help to
pardon, but the bond of guilt; not because the law is evil, but because ‘sin,’ as it is written,
‘works death to such persons by that which is good.’ For by the commandment, he sins
more grievously, who, by the commandment, knows how evil are the sins which he commits.”
Although Augustin states clearly that this letter is written against those “who arrogate too
much to the human will, imagining that, the law being given, the will is, of its own strength,
sufficient to fulfil the law, though not assisted by any grace imparted by the Holy Ghost, in
<note type="footnote">58 As quoted above, p. xx.</note>

<pb n="34"/> 
addition to instruction in the law,”—he refrains still from mentioning the names of the authors
of this teaching, evidently out of a lingering tenderness in his treatment of them. This
will help us to explain the courtesy of a note which he sent to Pelagius himself at about this
time, in reply to a letter he had received some time before from him; of which Pelagius afterwards
(at the Synod of Diospolis) made, to say the least of it, an ungenerous use. This
note,59 Augustin tells us, was written with “tempered praises” (wherefrom we see his
lessening respect for the man), and so as to admonish Pelagius to think rightly concerning
grace,—so far as could be done without raising the dregs of the controversy in a formal note.
This he accomplished by praying from the Lord for him, those good things by which he
might be good forever, and might live eternally with Him who is eternal; and by asking his
prayers in return, that he, too, might be made by the Lord such as he seemed to suppose he
already was. How Augustin could really intend these prayers to be understood as an admonition
to Pelagius to look to God for what he was seeking to work out for himself, is fully illustrated
by the closing words of this almost contemporary letter to Anastasius: “Pray,
therefore, for us,” he writes, “that we may be righteous,—an attainment wholly beyond a
man’s reach, unless he know righteousness, and be willing to practise it, but one which is
immediately realized when he is perfectly willing; but this cannot be in him unless he is
healed by the grace of the Spirit, and aided to be able.” The point had already been made in
the controversy, that, by the Pelagian doctrine, so much power was attributed to the human
will, that no one ought to pray, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”</p>
<p>If he was anxious to avoid personal controversy with Pelagius himself in the hope that
he might even yet be reclaimed, Augustin was equally anxious to teach the truth on all possible
occasions. Pelagius had been intimate, when at Rome, with the pious Paulinus, bishop
of Nola; and it was understood that there was some tendency at Nola to follow the new
teachings. It was, perhaps, as late as 414, when Augustin made reply in a long letter,60 to a
request of Paulinus’ for an exposition of certain difficult Scriptures, which had been sent
him about 410.61 Among them was Rom. xi. 28; and, in explaining it, Augustin did not
withhold a tolerably complete account of his doctrine of predestination, involving the essence
of his whole teaching as to grace: “For when he had said, ‘according to the election they are
beloved for their father’s sake,’ he added, ‘for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.’
You see that those are certainly meant who belong to the number of the predestinated.…‘
Many indeed are called, but few chosen;’ but those who are elect, these are called
‘according to His purpose;’ and it is beyond doubt that in them God’s foreknowledge cannot
be deceived. These He foreknew and predestinated to be conformed to the image of His

<pb n="35"/>
Son, in order that He might be the first born among many brethren. But ‘whom He predestinated,
them He also called.’ This calling is ‘according to His purpose,’ this calling is ‘without
repentance,’”etc., quoting Rom. v. 28–31. Then continuing, he says, “Those are not in this
vocation, who do not persevere unto the end in the faith that worketh by love, although
they walk in it a little while.…But the reason why some belong to it, and some do not, can
easily be hidden, but cannot be unjust. For is there injustice with God? God forbid! For this
belongs to those high judgments which, so to say, terrified the wondering apostle to look
upon.”</p>
    
<p>Among the most remarkable of the controversial sermons that were preached about
this time, especial mention is due to two that were delivered at Carthage, midsummer of
413. The former of these62 was preached on the festival of John the Baptist’s birth (June 24),
and naturally took the forerunner for its subject. The nativity of John suggesting the nativity
of Christ, the preacher spoke of the marvel of the incarnation. He who was in the beginning,
and was the Word of God, and was Himself God, and who made all things, and in whom
was life, even this one “came to us. To whom? To the worthy? Nay, but to the unworthy!
For Christ died for the ungodly, and for the unworthy, though He was worthy. We indeed
were unworthy whom He pitied; but He was worthy who pitied us, to whom we say, ‘For
Thy pity’s sake, Lord, free us!’ Not for the sake of our preceding merits, but ‘for Thy pity’s
sake, Lord, free us;’ and ‘for Thy name’s sake be propitious to our sins,’ not for our merit’s
sake.…For the merit of sins is, of course, not reward, but punishment.” He then dwelt upon
the necessity of the incarnation, and the necessity of a mediator between God and “the whole
mass of the human race alienated from Him by Adam.” Then quoting 1 Cor. iv. 7, he asserts
that it is not our varying merits, but God’s grace alone, that makes us differ, and that we are
all alike, great and small, old and young, saved by one and the same Saviour. “What then,
some one says,” he continues, “even the infant needs a liberator? Certainly he needs one.
And the witness to it is the mother that faithfully runs to church with the child to be baptized.
The witness is Mother Church herself, who receives the child for washing, and either for
dismissing him [from this life] freed, or nurturing him in piety.…Last of all, the tears of his
own misery are witness in the child himself.…Recognize the misery, extend the help. Let
all put on bowels of mercy. By as much as they cannot speak for themselves, by so much
more pityingly let us speak for the little ones,”—and then follows a passage calling on the
Church to take the grace of infants in their charge as orphans committed to their care, which
is in substance repeated from a former sermon.63 The speaker proceeded to quote Matt. i.
21, and apply it. If Jesus came to save from sins, and infants are brought to Him, it is to
confess that they, too, are sinners. Then, shall they be withheld from baptism? “Certainly,
<note type="footnote">62 Sermon 293.</note>
<note type="footnote">63 Sermon 176, 2.</note>

<pb n="36"/>
if the child could speak for himself, he would repel the voice of opposition, and cry out,
‘Give me Christ’s life! In Adam I died: give me Christ’s life; in whose sight I am not clean,
even if I am an infant whose life has been but one day in the earth.’” “No way can be found,”
adds the preacher, “of coming into the life of this world except by Adam; no way can be
found of escaping punishment in the next world except by Christ. Why do you shut up the
one door?” Even John the Baptist himself was born in sin; and absolutely no one can be
found who was born apart from sin, until you find one who was born apart from Adam.
“‘By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin, death; and so it passed through upon
all men.’ If these were my words, could this sentiment be expressed more expressly, more
clearly, more fully?”</p>
    
<p>Three days afterwards,64 on the invitation of the Bishop of Carthage, Augustin preached
a sermon professedly directed against the Pelagians,65 which takes up the threads hinted at
in the former discourse, and develops a full polemic with reference to the baptism of infants.
He began, formally enough, with the determination of the question in dispute. The Pelagians
concede that infants should be baptized. The only question is, for what are they baptized?
We say that they would not otherwise have salvation and eternal life; but they say it is not
for salvation, not for eternal life, but for the kingdom of God.…“The child, they say, although
not baptized, by the desert of his innocence, in that he has no sin at all, either actual or orixxx
ginal, either from himself or contracted from Adam, necessarily has salvation and eternal
life even if not baptized; but is to be baptized for this reason,—that he may enter into the
kingdom of God, i.e., into the kingdom of heaven.” He then shows that there is no eternal
life outside the kingdom of heaven, no middle place between the right and left hand of the
judge at the last day, and that, therefore, to exclude one from the kingdom of God is to
consign him to the pains of eternal fire; while, on the other side, no one ascends into heaven
unless he has been made a member of Christ, and this can only be by faith,—which, in an
infant’s case, is professed by another in his stead. He then treats, at length, some of the
puzzling questions with which the Pelagians were wont to try the catholics; and then
breaking off suddenly, he took a volume in his hands. “I ask you,” he said, “to bear with me
a little: I will read somewhat. It is St. Cyprian whom I hold in my hand, the ancient bishop
of this see. What he thought of the baptism of infants,—nay, what he has shown that the
Church always thought,—learn in brief. For it is not enough for them to dispute and argue,
I know not what impious novelties: they even try to charge us with asserting something
novel. It is on this account that I read here St. Cyprian, in order that you may perceive that
<note type="footnote">64 The inscription says, “V Calendus Julii,” i.e., June 27; but it also says, “In natalis martyris Guddentis,”
whose day appears to have been July 18. Some of the martyrologies assign 28th of June to Gaudentius (which
some copies read here), but possibly none to Guddene.</note>
<note type="footnote">65 Sermon 294.</note>

<pb n="37"/>
the orthodox understanding and catholic sense reside in the words which I have been just
now speaking to you. He was asked whether an infant ought to be baptized before he was
eight days old, seeing that by the ancient law no infant was allowed to be circumcised unless
he was eight days old. A question arose from this as to the day of baptism,—for concerning
the origin of sin there was no question; and therefore from this thing of which there was no
question, that question that had arisen was settled.” And then he read to them the passage
out of Cyprian’s letter to Fidus, which declared that he, and all the council with him, unanimously
thought that infants should be baptized at the earliest possible age, lest they should
die in their inherited sin, and so pass into eternal punishment.66 The sermon closed with a
tender warning to the teachers of these strange doctrines: he might call them heretics with
truth, but he will not; let the Church seek still their salvation, and not mourn them as dead;
let them be exhorted as friends, not striven with as enemies. “They disparage us,” he says,
“we will bear it; let them not disparage the rule [of faith], let them not disparage the truth;
let them not contradict the Church, which labours every day for the remission of infants’
original sin. This thing is settled. The errant disputer may be borne with in other questions
that have not been thoroughly canvassed, that are not yet settled by the full authority of the
Church,—their error should be borne with: it ought not to extend so far, that they endeavour
to shake even the very foundation of the Church!” He hints that although the patience
hitherto exhibited towards them is “perhaps not blameworthy,” yet patience may cease to
be a virtue, and become culpable negligence: in the mean time, however, he begs that the
catholics should continue amicable, fraternal, placid, loving, long suffering.</p>
<p>Augustin himself gives us a view of the progress of the controversy at this time in a letter
written in 414.67 The Pelagians had everywhere scattered the seeds of their new error; and
although some, by his ministry and that of his brother workers, had, “by God’s mercy,” been
cured of their pest, yet they still existed in Africa, especially about Carthage, and were
everywhere propagating their opinions in subterraneous whispers, for fear of the judgment
of the Church. Wherever they were not refuted, they were seducing others to their following;
and they were so spread abroad that he did not know where they would break out next.
Nevertheless, he was still unwilling to brand them as heretics, and was more desirous of
healing them as sick members of the Church than of cutting them off finally as too diseased
for cure. Jerome also tells us that the poison was spreading in both the East and the West,
and mentions particularly as seats where it showed itself the islands of Rhodes and Sicily.
Of Rhodes we know nothing further; but from Sicily an appeal came to Augustin in 414
<note type="footnote">66 The passage is quoted at length in On the Merits and Remission of Sins, iii. 10. Compare Against Two Letters
of the Pelagians, iv. 23.</note>

<pb n="38"/>
from one Hilary,68 setting forth that there were certain Christians about Syracuse who taught
strange doctrines, and beseeching Augustin to help him in dealing with them. The doctrines
were enumerated as follows: “They say (1) that man can be without sin, (2) and can easily
keep the commandments of God if he will; (3) that an unbaptized infant, if he is cut off by
death, cannot justly perish, since he is born without sin; (4) that a rich man that remains in
his riches cannot enter the kingdom of God, except he sell all that he has;…(5) that we ought
not to swear at all;” (6) and, apparently, that the Church is to be in this world without spot
or blemish. Augustin suspected that these Sicilian disturbances were in some way the work
of Coelestius, and therefore in his answer69 informs his correspondent of what had been
done at the Synod of Carthage (412) against him. The long letter that he sent back follows
the inquiries in the order they were put by Hilary. To the first he replies, in substance, as he
had treated the same matter in the second book of the treatise, On the Merits and Forgiveness
of Sins, that it was opposed to Scripture, but was less a heresy than the wholly unbearable
opinion that this state of sinlessness could be attained without God’s help. “But when they
say that free will suffices to man for fulfilling the precepts of the Lord, even though unaided
to good works by God’s grace and the gift of the Holy Spirit, it is to be altogether anathematized
and detested with all execrations. For those who assert this are inwardly alien from
God’s grace, because being ignorant of God’s righteousness, like the Jews of whom the
apostle speaks, and wishing to establish their own, they are not subject to God’s righteousness,
since there is no fulfilment of the law except love; and of course the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts, not by ourselves, nor by the force of our own will, but by the Holy
Ghost who is given to us.” Dealing next with the second point, he drifts into the matter he
had more fully developed in his work On the Spirit and the Letter. “Free will avails for God’s
works,” he says, “if it be divinely aided, and this comes by humble seeking and doing; but
when deserted by divine aid, no matter how excellent may be its knowledge of the law, it
will by no means possess solidity of righteousness, but only the inflation of ungodly pride
and deadly arrogance. This is taught us by that same Lord’s Prayer; for it would be an empty
thing for us to ask God ‘Lead us not into temptation,’ if the matter was so placed in our
power that we would avail for fulfilling it without any aid from Him. For this free will is free
in proportion as it is sound, but it is sound in proportion as it is subject to divine pity and
grace. For it faithfully prays, saying, ‘Direct my ways according to Thy word, and let no
iniquity reign over me.’ For how is that free over which iniquity reigns? But see who it is
that is invoked by it, in order that it may not reign over it. For it says not, ‘Direct my ways
according to free will because no iniquity shall rule over me,’ but ‘Direct my ways according
to Thy word, and let no iniquity rule over me.’ It is a prayer, not a promise; it is a confession,
<note type="footnote">68 Epistle 156, among Augustin’s Letters.</note>
<note type="footnote">69 Epistle, 157, 22.</note>

<pb n="39"/>
not a profession; it is a wish for full freedom, not a boast of personal power. For it is not
every one ‘who confides in his own power,’ but ‘every one who calls on the name of God,
that shall be saved.’ ‘But how shall they call upon Him,’ he says, ‘in whom they have not
believed?’ Accordingly, then, they who rightly believe, believe in order to call on Him in
whom they have believed, and to avail for doing what they receive in the precepts of the
law; since what the law commands, faith prays for.” “God, therefore, commands continence,
and gives continence; He commands by the law, He gives by grace; He commands by the
letter, He gives by the spirit: for the law without grace makes the transgression to abound,
and the letter without the spirit kills. He commands for this reason,—that we who have endeavoured
to do what He commands, and are worn out in our weakness under the law, may
know how to ask for the aid of grace; and if we have been able to do any good work, that
we may not be ungrateful to Him who aids us.” The answer to the third point traverses the
ground that was fully covered in the first book of the treatise On the Merits and Forgiveness
of Sins, beginning by opposing the Pelagians to Paul in Rom. v. 12–19: “But when they say
that an infant, cut off by death, unbaptized, cannot perish since he is born without sin,—it
is not this that the apostle says; and I think that it is better to believe the apostle than them.”
The fourth and fifth questions were new in this controversy; and it is not certain that they
belong properly to it, though the legalistic asceticism of the Pelagian leaders may well have
given rise to a demand on all Christians to sell what they had, and give to the poor. This
one of the points, Augustin treats at length, pointing out that many of the saints of old were
rich, and that the Lord and His apostles always so speak that their counsels avail to the right
use, not the destruction, of wealth. Christians ought so to hold their wealth that they are
not held by it, and by no means prefer it to Christ. Equal good sense and mildness are shown
in his treatment of the question concerning oaths, which he points out were used by the
Lord and His apostles, but advises to be used as little as possible lest by the custom of frequent
oaths we learn to swear lightly. The question as to the Church, he passes over as having been
sufficiently treated in the course of his previous remarks.</p>
<p>To the number of those who had been rescued from Pelagianism by his efforts, Augustin
was now to have the pleasure of adding two others, in whom he seems to have taken much
delight. Timasius and James were two young men of honorable birth and liberal education,
who had, by the exhortation of Pelagius, been moved to give up the hope that they had in
this world, and enter upon the service of God in an ascetic life.70 Naturally, they had turned
to him for instruction, and had received a book to which they had given their study. They
met somewhere with some of Augustin’s writings, however, and were deeply affected by
what he said as to grace, and now began to see that the teaching of Pelagius opposed the
grace of God by which man becomes a Christian. They gave their book, therefore, to Au-
<note type="footnote">70 Epistles 177, 6; and 179, 2.</note>

<pb n="40"/>
gustin, saying that it was Pelagius’, and asking him for Pelagius’ sake, and for the sake of
the truth, to answer it. This was done, and the resulting book, On Nature and Grace, sent
to the young men, who returned a letter of thanks71 in which they professed their conversion
from their error. In this book, too, which was written in 415, Augustin refrained from
mentioning Pelagius by name,72 feeling it better to spare the man while not sparing his
writings. But he tells us, that, on reading the book of Pelagius to which it was an answer, it
became clear to him beyond any doubt that his teaching was distinctly anti-Christian;73 and
when speaking of his own book privately to a friend, he allows himself to call it “a considerable
book against the heresy of Pelagius, which he had been constrained to write by some
brethren whom he had persuaded to adopt his fatal error, denying the grace of Christ.”74
Thus his attitude towards the persons of the new teachers was becoming ever more and
more strained, in despite of his full recognition of the excellent motives that might lie behind
their “zeal not according to knowledge.” This treatise opens with a recognition of the zeal
of Pelagius, which, as it burns most ardently against those who, when reproved for sin, take
refuge in censuring their nature, Augustin compares with the heathen view as expressed in
Sallust’s saying, “the human race falsely complains of its own nature,”75 and which he charges
with not being according to knowledge, and proposes to oppose by an equal zeal against all
attempts to render the cross of Christ of none effect. He then gives a brief but excellent
summary of the more important features of the catholic doctrine concerning nature and
grace (2–7). Opening the work of Pelagius, which had been placed in his hands, he examines
his doctrine of sin, its nature and effects. Pelagius, he points out, draws a distinction, sound
enough in itself, between what is “possible” and what is “actual,” but applies it unsoundly
to sin, when he says that every man has the possibility of being without sin (8–9), and
therefore without condemnation. Not so, says Augustin; an infant who dies unbaptized has
no possibility of salvation open to him; and the man who has lived and died in a land where
it was impossible for him to hear the name of Christ, has had no possibility open to him of
becoming righteous by nature and free will. If this be not so, Christ is dead in vain, since all
men then might have accomplished their salvation, even if Christ had never died (10).
Pelagius, moreover, he shows, exhibits a tendency to deny the sinful character of all sins
that are impossible to avoid, and so treats of sins of ignorance as to show that he excuses
them (13–19). When he argues that no sin, because it is not a substance, can change nature,
which is a substance, Augustin replies that this destroys the Saviour’s work,—for how can

He save from sins if sins do not corrupt? And, again, if an act cannot injure a substance,
how can abstention from food, which is a mere act, kill the body? In the same way sin is not
a substance; but God is a substance,—yea, the height of substance, and only true sustenance
of the reasonable creature; and the consequence of departure from Him is to the soul what
refusal of food is to the body (22). To Pelagius’ assertion that sin cannot be punished by
more sin, Augustin replies that the apostle thinks differently (Rom. i. 21–31). Then putting
his finger on the main point in controversy, he quotes the Scriptures as declaring the present
condition of man to be that of spiritual death. “The truth then designates as dead those
whom this man declares to be unable to be damaged or corrupted by sin,—because, forsooth,
he has discovered sin to be no substance!” (25). It was by free will that man passed into this
state of death; but a dead man needs something else to revive him,—he needs nothing less
than a Vivifier. But of vivifying grace, Pelagius knew nothing; and by knowing nothing of
a Vivifier, he knows nothing of a Saviour; but rather by making nature of itself able to be
sinless, he glorifies the Creator at the expense of the Saviour (39). Next is examined Pelagius’
contention that many saints are enumerated in the Scriptures as having lived sinlessly in
this world. While declining to discuss the question of fact as to the Virgin Mary (42), Augustin
opposes to the rest the declaration of John in 1 John i. 8, as final, but still pauses to explain
why the Scriptures do not mention the sins of all, and to contend that all who ever were
saved under the Old Testament or the New, were saved by the sacrificial death of Christ,
and by faith in Him (40–50). Thus we are brought, as Augustin says, to the core of the
question, which concerns, not the fact of sinlessness in any man, but man’s ability to be
sinless. This ability Pelagius affirms of all men, and Augustin denies of all “unless they are
justified by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ and Him crucified” (51). Thus,
the whole discussion is about grace, which Pelagius does not admit in any true sense, but
places only in the nature that God has made (52). We are next invited to attend to another
distinction of Pelagius’, in which he discriminates sharply between the nature that God has
made, the crown of which is free will, and the use that man makes of this free will. The endowment
of free will is a “capacity;” it is, because given by God in our making, a necessity
of nature, and not in man’s power to have or not have. It is the right use of it only, which
man has in his power. This analysis, Pelagius illustrates at length, by appealing to the difference
between the possession and use of the various bodily senses. The ability to see, for instance,
he says, is a necessity of our nature; we do not make it, we cannot help having it; it
is ours only to use it. Augustin criticises this presentation of the matter with great sharpness
(although he is not averse to the analysis itself),—showing the inapplicability of the illustrations
used,—for, he asks, is it not possible for us to blind ourselves, and so no longer have
the ability to see? and would not many a man like to control the “use” of his “capacity” to
hear when a screechy saw is in the neighbourhood? (55); and as well the falsity of the contention
illustrated, since Pelagius has ignored the fall, and, even were that not so, has so ig-

<pb n="42"/>
nored the need of God’s aid for all good, in any state of being, as to deny it (56). Moreover,
it is altogether a fallacy, Augustin argues, to contend that men have the “ability” to make
every use we can conceive of our faculties. We cannot wish for unhappiness; God cannot
deny Himself (57); and just so, in a corrupt nature, the mere possession of a faculty of choice
does not imply the ability to use that faculty for not sinning. “Of a man, indeed, who has
his legs strong and sound, it may be said admissibly enough, ‘whether he will or not, he has
the capacity of walking;’ but if his legs be broken, however much he may wish, he has not
the ‘capacity.’ The nature of which our author speaks is corrupted” (57). What, then, can
he mean by saying that, whether we will or not, we have the capacity of not sinning,—a
statement so opposite to Paul’s in Rom. vii. 15? Some space is next given to an attempted
rebuttal by Pelagius of the testimony of Gal. v. 17, on the ground that the “flesh” there does
not refer to the baptized (60–70); and then the passages are examined which Pelagius had
quoted against Augustin out of earlier writers,—Lactantius (71), Hilary (72), Ambrose (75),
John of Constantinople (76), Xystus,—a blunder of Pelagius, who quoted from a Pythagorean
philosopher, mistaking him for the Roman bishop Sixtus (57), Jerome (78), and Augustin
himself (80). All these writers, Augustin shows, admitted the universal sinfulness of
man,—and especially he himself had confessed the necessity of grace in the immediate
context of the passage quoted by Pelagius. The treatise closes (82 sq.) with a noble panegyric
on that love which God sheds abroad in the heart, by the Holy Ghost, and by which alone
we can be made keepers of the law.</p>
<p>The treatise On Nature and Grace was as yet unfinished, when the over-busy76 scriptorium
at Hippo was invaded by another young man seeking instruction. This time it was a
zealous young presbyter from the remotest part of Spain, “from the shore of the
ocean,”—Paulus Orosius by name, whose pious soul had been afflicted with grievous wounds
by the Priscillianist and Origenist heresies that had broken out in his country, and who had
come with eager haste to Augustin, on hearing that he could get from him the instruction
which he needed for confuting them. Augustin seems to have given him his heart at once;
and, feeling too little informed as to the special heresies which he wished to be prepared to
controvert, persuaded him to go on to Palestine to be taught by Jerome, and gave him introductions
which described him as one “who is in the bond of catholic peace a brother, in
point of age a son, and in honour a fellow-presbyter,—a man of quick understanding, ready
speech, and burning zeal.” His departure to Palestine gave Augustin an opportunity to
consult with Jerome on the one point that had been raised in the Pelagian controversy on
which he had not been able to see light. The Pelagians had early argued,77 that, if souls are
<note type="footnote">76 For Augustin’s press of work just now, see Epistle 169, 1 and 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">77 The argument occurs in Pelagius’ Commentary on Paul, written before 410, and is already before Augustin

<pb n="43"/>
created anew for men at their birth, it would be unjust in God to impute Adam’s sin to them.
And Augustin found himself unable either to prove that souls are transmitted (traduced, as
the phrase is), or to show that it would not involve God in injustice to make a soul only to
make it subject to a sin committed by another. Jerome had already put himself on record
as a believer in both original sin and the creation of souls at the time of birth. Augustin
feared the logical consequences of this assertion, and yet was unable to refute it. He therefore
seized this occasion to send a long treatise on the origin of the soul to his friend, with the
request that he would consider the subject anew, and answer his doubts.78 In this treatise
he stated that he was fully persuaded that the soul had fallen into sin, but by no fault of God
or of nature, but of its own free will; and asked when could the soul of an infant have contracted
the guilt, which, unless the grace of Christ should come to its rescue by baptism,
would involve it in condemnation, if God (as Jerome held, and as he was willing to hold
with him, if this difficulty could be cleared up) makes each soul for each individual at the
time of birth? He professed himself embarrassed on sucha supposition by the penal sufferings
of infants, the pains they endured in this life, and much more the danger they are in of
eternal damnation, into which they actually go unless saved by baptism. God is good, just,
omnipotent: how, then, can we account for the fact that “in Adam all die,” if souls are created
afresh for each birth? “If new souls are made for men,” he affirms, “individually at their
birth, I do not see, on the one hand, that they could have any sin while yet in infancy; nor
do I believe, on the other hand, that God condemns any soul which He sees to have no sin;”
“and yet, whoever says that those children who depart out of this life without partaking of
the sacrament of baptism, shall be made alive in Christ, certainly contradicts the apostolic
declaration,” and “he that is not made alive in Christ must necessarily remain under the
condemnation of which the apostle says that by the offence of one, judgment came upon
all men to condemnation.” “Wherefore,” he adds to his correspondent, “if that opinion of
yours does not contradict this firmly grounded article of faith, let it be mine also; but if it
does, let it no longer be yours.”79 So far as obtaining light was concerned, Augustin might
have spared himself the pain of this composition: Jerome simply answered80 that he had no
leisure to reply to the questions submitted to him. But Orosius’ mission to Palestine was big
with consequences. Once there, he became the accuser of Pelagius before John of Jerusalem,
and the occasion, at least, of the trials of Pelagius in Palestine during the summer and winter
of 415 which issued so disastrously, and ushered in a new phase of the conflict.</p>

<pb n="44"/>
<p>Meanwhile, however, Augustin was ignorant of what was going on in the East, and had
his mind directed again to Sicily. About a year had passed since he had sent thither his long
letter to Hilary. Now his conjecture that Coelestius was in some way at the bottom of the
Sicilian outbreak, received confirmation from a paper which certain catholic brethren
brought out of Sicily, and which was handed to Augustin by two exiled Spanish bishops,
Eutropius and Paul. This paper bore the title, Definitions Ascribed to Coelestius, and
presented internal evidence, in style and thought, of being correctly so ascribed.81 It consisted
of three parts, in the first of which were collected a series of brief and compressed “definitions,”
or “ratiocinations” as Augustin calls them, in which the author tries to place the
catholics in a logical dilemma, and to force them to admit that man can live in this world
without sin. In the second part, he adduced certain passages of Scripture in defence of his
doctrine. In the third part, he undertook to deal with the texts that had been quoted against
his contention, not, however, by examining into their meaning, or seeking to explain them
in the sense of his theory, but simply by matching them with others which he thought made
for him. Augustin at once (about the end of 415) wrote a treatise in answer to this, which
bears the title of On the Perfection of Man’s Righteousness. The distribution of the matter in
this work follows that of the treatise to which it is an answer. First of all (1–16), the “ratiocinations”
are taken up one by one and briefly answered. As they all concern sin, and have for
their object to prove that man cannot be accounted a sinner unless he is able, in his own
power, wholly to avoid sin,—that is, to prove that a plenary natural ability is the necessary
basis of responsibility,—Augustin argues per contra that man can entail a sinfulness on
himself for which and for the deeds of which he remains responsible, though he is no longer
able to avoid sin; thus admitting that for the race, plenary ability must stand at the root of
sinfulness. Next (17–22) he discusses the passages which Coelestius had advanced in defence
of his teachings, viz., (1) passages in which God commands men to be without sin, which
Augustin meets by saying that the point is, whether these commands are to be fulfilled
without God’s aid, in the body of this death, while absent from the Lord (17–20); and (2)
passages in which God declares that His commandments are not grievous, which Augustin
meets by explaining that all God’s commandments are fulfilled only by Love, which finds
nothing grievous; and that this love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, without
whom we have only fear, to which the commandments are not only grievous, but impossible.
Lastly, Augustin patiently follows Coelestius through his odd “oppositions of texts,” explaining
carefully all that he had adduced, in an orthodox sense (23–42). In closing, he takes up
Coelestius’ statement, that “it is quite possible for man not to sin even in word, if God so
will,” pointing out how he avoids saying “if God give him His help,” and then proceeds to
distinguish carefully between the differing assertions of sinlessness that may be made. To
<note type="footnote">81 See On the Perfection of Man’s Righteousness, 1.</note>

<pb n="45"/>
say that any man ever lived, or will live, without needing forgiveness, is to contradict Rom.
v. 12, and must imply that he does not need a Saviour, against Matt. ix. 12, 13. To say that
after his sins have been forgiven, any one has ever remained without sin, contradicts 1 John
i. 8 and Matt. vi. 12. Yet, if God’s help be allowed, this contention is not so wicked as the
other; and the great heresy is to deny the necessity of God’s constant grace, for which we
pray when we say, “Lead us not into temptation.”</p>
<p>Tidings were now (416) beginning to reach Africa of what was doing in the East. There
was diligently circulated everywhere, and came into Augustin’s hands, an epistle of Pelagius’
own “filled with vanity,” in which he boasted that fourteen bishops had approved his assertion
that “man can live without sin, and easily keep the commandments if he wishes,” and had
thus “shut the mouth of opposition in confusion,” and “broken up the whole band of wicked
conspirators against him.” Soon afterwards a copy of an “apologetical paper,” in which
Pelagius used the authority of the Palestinian bishops against his adversaries, not altogether
without disingenuousness, was sent by him to Augustin through the hands of a common
acquaintance, Charus by name. It was not accompanied, however, by any letter from Pelagius;
and Augustin wisely refrained from making public use of it. Towards midsummer
Orosius came with more authentic information, and bearing letters from Jerome and Heros
and Lazarus. It was apparently before his coming that a controversial sermon was preached,
only a fragment of which has come down to us.82 So far as we can learn from the extant
part, its subject seems to have been the relation of prayer to Pelagianism; and what we have,
opens with a striking anecdote: “When these two petitions—‘Forgive us our debts as we also
forgive our debtors,’ and ‘Lead us not into temptation’—are objected to the Pelagians, what
do you think they reply? I was horrified, my brethren, when I heard it. I did not, indeed,
hear it with my own ears; but my holy brother and fellow-bishop Urbanus, who used to be
presbyter here, and now is bishop of Sicca,” when he was in Rome, and was arguing with
one who held these opinions, pressed him with the weight of the Lord’s Prayer, and “what
do you think he replied to him? ‘We ask God,’ he said, ‘not to lead us into temptation, lest
we should suffer something that is not in our power,—lest I should be thrown from my
horse; lest I should break my leg; lest a robber should slay me, and the like. For these things,’
he said, ‘are not in my power; but for overcoming the temptations of my sins, I both have
ability if I wish to use it, and am not able to receive God’s help.’83 You see, brethren,” the
good bishop adds, “how malignant this heresy is: you see how it horrifies all of you. Have
a care that you be not taken by it.” He then presses the general doctrine of prayer as proving
that all good things come from God, whose aid is always necessary to us, and is always attainable
by prayer; and closes as follows: “Consider, then, these things, my brethren, when

any one comes to you and says to you, ‘What, then, are we to do if we have nothing in our
power, unless God gives all things? God will not then crown us, but He will crown Himself.’
You already see that this comes from that vein: it is a vein, but it has poison in it; it is stricken
by the serpent; it is not sound. For what Satan is doing to-day is seeking to cast out from
the Church by the poison of heretics, just as he once cast out from Paradise by the poison
of the serpent. Let no one tell you that this one was acquitted by the bishops: there was an
acquittal, but it was his confession, so to speak, his amendment, that was acquitted. For
what he said before the bishops seemed catholic; but what he wrote in his books, the bishops
who pronounced the acquittal were ignorant of. And perchance he was really convinced
and amended. For we ought not to despair of the man who perchance preferred to be united
to the catholic faith, and fled to its grace and aid. Perchance this was what happened. But,
in any event, it was not the heresy that was acquitted, but the man who denied the heresy.”84</p>
<p>The coming of Orosius must have dispelled any lingering hope that the meaning of the
council’s finding was that Pelagius had really recanted. Councils were immediately assembled
at Carthage and Mileve, and the documents which Orosius had brought were read before
them. We know nothing of their proceedings except what we can gather from the letters
which they sent85 to Innocent at Rome, seeking his aid in their condemnation of the heresy
now so nearly approved in Palestine. To these two official letters, Augustin, in company
with four other bishops, added a third private letter,86 in which they took care that Innocent
should be informed on all the points necessary to his decision. This important letter begins
almost abruptly with a characterization of Pelagianism as inimical to the grace of God, and
has grace for its subject throughout. It accounts for the action of the Palestinian synod, as
growing out of a misunderstanding of Pelagius’ words, in which he seemed to acknowledge
grace, which these catholic bishops understood naturally to mean that grace of which they
read in the Scriptures, and which they were accustomed to preach to their people,—the
grace by which we are justified from iniquity, and saved from weakness; while he meant
nothing more than that by which we are given free will at our creation. “For if these bishops
had understood that he meant only that grace which we have in common with the ungodly
and with all, along with whom we are men, while he denied that by which we are Christians
and the sons of God, they not only could not have patiently listened to him,—they could
not even have borne him before their eyes.” The letter then proceeds to point out the difference
between grace and natural gifts, and between grace and the law, and to trace out Pelagius’
meaning when he speaks of grace, and when he contends that man can be sinless
<note type="footnote">84 Compare the similar words in Epistle 177, 3, which was written, not only after what had occurred in
Palestine was known, but also after the condemnatory decisions of the African synods.</note>

<note type="footnote">86 Epistle 177. The other bishops were Aurelius, Alypius, Evodius, and Possidius.</note>

without any really inward aid. It suggests that Pelagius be sent for, and thoroughly examined
by Innocent, or that he should be examined by letter or in his writings; and that he be not
cleared until he unequivocally confessed the grace of God in the catholic sense, and anathematized
the false teachings in the books attributed to him. The book of Pelagius which was
answered in the treatise On Nature and Grace was enclosed, with this letter, with the most
important passages marked: and it was suggested that more was involved in the matter than
the fate of one single man, Pelagius, who, perhaps, was already brought to a better mind;
the fate of multitudes already led astray, or yet to be deceived by these false views, was in
danger.</p>
<p>At about this same time (417), the tireless bishop sent a short letter87 to a Hilary, who
seems to be Hilary of Norbonne, which is interesting from its undertaking to convey a
characterization of Pelagianism to one who was as yet ignorant of it. It thus brings out what
Augustin conceived to be its essential features. “An effort has been made,” we read, “to raise
a certain new heresy, inimical to the grace of Christ, against the Church of Christ. It is not
yet openly separated from the Church. It is the heresy of men who dare to attribute so much
power to human weakness that they contend that this only belongs to God’s grace,—that
we are created with free will and the possibility of not sinning, and that we receive God’s
commandments which are to be fulfilled by us; but, for keeping and fulfilling these commandments,
we do not need any divine aid. No doubt, the remission of sins is necessary for
us; for we have no power to right what we have done wrong in the past. But for avoiding
and overcoming sins in the future, for conquering all temptations with virtue, the human
will is sufficient by its natural capacity without any aid of God’s grace. And neither do infants
need the grace of the Saviour, so as to be liberated by it through His baptism from perdition,
seeing that they have contracted no contagion of damnation from Adam.”88 He engages
Hilary in the destruction of this heresy, which ought to be “concordantly condemned and
anathematized by all who have hope in Christ,” as a “pestiferous impiety,” and excuses
himself for not undertaking its full refutation in a brief letter. A much more important letter
was sent off, at about the same time, to John of Jerusalem, who had conducted the first
Palestinian examination of Pelagius, and had borne a prominent part in the synod at
Diospolis. He sent with it a copy of Pelagius’ book which he had examined in his treatise
On Nature and Grace, as well as a copy of that reply itself, and asked John to send him an
authentic copy of the proceedings at Diospolis. He took this occasion seriously to warn his
brother bishop against the wiles of Pelagius, and begged him, if he loved Pelagius, to let men
see that he did not so love him as to be deceived by him. He pointed out that in the book
sent with the letter, Pelagius called nothing the grace of God except nature; and that he af-

<note type="footnote">88 Epistle 179.</note>

<pb n="48"/>
firmed, and even vehemently contended, that by free will alone, human nature was able to
suffice for itself for working righteousness and keeping all God’s commandments; whence
any one could see that he opposed the grace of God of which the apostles spoke in Rom. vii.
24, 25, and contradicted, as well, all the prayers and benedictions of the Church by which
blessings were sought for men from God’s grace. “If you love Pelagius, then,” he continued,
“let him, too, love you as himself,—nay, more than himself; and let him not deceive you.
For when you hear him confess the grace of God and the aid of God, you think he means
what you mean by it. But let him be openly asked whether he desires that we should pray
God that we sin not; whether he proclaims the assisting grace of God, without which we
would do much evil; whether he believes that even children who have not yet been able to
do good or evil are nevertheless, on account of one man by whom sin entered into the world,
sinners in him, and in need of being delivered by the grace of Christ.” If he openly denies
such things, Augustin would be pleased to hear of it.</p>
<p>Thus we see the great bishop sitting in his library at Hippo, placing his hands on the
two ends of the world. That nothing may be lacking to the picture of his universal activity,
we have another letter from him, coming from about this same time, that exhibits his care
for the individuals who had placed themselves in some sort under his tutelage. Among the
refugees from Rome in the terrible times when Alaric was a second time threatening the
city, was a family of noble women,—Proba, Juliana, and Demetrias,89—grandmother,
mother, and daughter,—who, finding an asylum in Africa, gave themselves to God’s service,
and sought the friendship and counsel of Augustin. In 413 the granddaughter “took the
veil” under circumstances that thrilled the Christian world, and brought out letters of congratulation
and advice from Augustin and Jerome, and also from Pelagius. This letter of
Pelagius seems not to have fallen into Augustin’s way until now (416): he was so disturbed
by it that he wrote to Juliana a long letter warning her against its evil counsels.90 It was so
shrewdly phrased, that, at first sight, Augustin was himself almost persuaded that it did
somehow acknowledge the grace of God; but when he compared it with others of Pelagius’
writings, he saw that here, too, he was using ambiguous phrases in a non-natural sense. The
object of his letter (in which Alypius is conjoined, as joint author) to Juliana is to warn her
and her holy daughter against all opinions that opposed the grace of God, and especially
against the covert teaching of the letter of Pelagius to Demetrias.91 “In this book,” he says,
“were it lawful for such an one to read it, a virgin of Christ would read that her holiness and
all her spiritual riches are to spring from no other source than herself; and thus before she

<pb n="49"/>
attains to the perfection of blessedness, she would learn—which may God forbid!—to be
ungrateful to God.” Then, after quoting the words of Pelagius, in which he declares that
“earthly riches came from others, but your spiritual riches no one can have conferred on
you but yourself; for these, then, you are justly praised, for these you are deservedly to be
preferred to others,—for they can exist only from yourself and in yourself,” he continues:
“Far be it from any virgin to listen to statements like these. Every virgin of Christ understands
the innate poverty of the human heart, and therefore declines to be adorned otherwise than
by the gifts of her spouse.…Let her not listen to him who says, ‘No one can confer them on
you but yourself, and they cannot exist except from you and in you:’ but to him who says,
‘We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God,
and not of us.’ And be not surprised that we speak of these things as yours, and not from
you; for we speak of daily bread as ‘ours,’ but yet add ‘give it to us,’ lest it should be thought
it was from ourselves.” Again, he warns her that grace is not mere knowledge any more than
mere nature; and that Pelagius, even when using the word “grace,” means no inward or efficient
aid, but mere nature or knowledge or forgiveness of past sins; and beseeches her not
to forget the God of all grace from whom (Wisdom i. 20, 21) Demetrias had that very virgin
continence which was so justly her boast.</p>
<p>With the opening of 417, came the answers from Innocent to the African letters.92 And
although they were marred by much boastful language concerning the dignity of his see,
which could not but be distasteful to the Africans, they admirably served their purpose in
the satisfactory manner in which they, on the one hand, asserted the necessity of the “daily
grace, and help of God,” for our good living, and, on the other, determined that the Pelagians
had denied this grace, and declared their leaders Pelagius and Coelestius deprived of the
communion of the Church until they should “recover their senses from the wiles of the
Devil by whom they are held captive according to his will.” Augustin may be pardoned for
supposing that a condemnation pronounced by two provincial synods in Africa, and
heartily concurred in by the Roman bishop, who had already at Jerusalem been recognized
as in some sort the fit arbiter of this Western dispute, should settle the matter. If Pelagius
had been before jubilant, Augustin found this a suitable time for his rejoicing.</p>
<p>About the same time with Innocent’s letters, the official proceedings of the synod of
Diospolis at last reached Africa, and Augustin lost no time (early in 417) in publishing a
full account and examination of them, thus providing us with that inestimable boon, a full
contemporary history of the chief events connected with the controversy up to this time.
This treatise, which is addressed to Aurelius, bishop of Carthage, opens with a brief explanation
of Augustin’s delay heretofore, in discussing Pelagius’ defence of himself in Palestine,
as due to his not having received the official copy of the Proceedings of the Council at
<note type="footnote">92 Epistles 181, 182, 183, among Augustin’s Letters.</note>

<pb n="50"/>
Diospolis (1–2a). Then Augustin proceeds at once to discuss at length the doings of the
synod, point by point, following the official record step by step (2b-45). He treats at large
here eleven items in the indictment, with Pelagius’ answers and the synod’s decision,
showing that in all of them Pelagius either explained away his heresy, taking advantage of
the ignorance of the judges of his books, or else openly repudiated or anathematized it.
When the twelfth item of the indictment was reached (41b-43), Augustin shows that the
synod was so indignant at its character (it charged Pelagius with teaching that men cannot
be sons of God unless they are sinless, and with condoning sins of ignorance, and with asserting
that choice is not free if it depends on God’s help, and that pardon is given according
to merit), that, without waiting for Pelagius’ answer, it condemned the statement, and
Pelagius at once repudiated and anathematized it (43). How could the synod act in such
circumstances, he asks, except by acquitting the man who condemned the heresy? After
quoting the final judgment of the synod (44), Augustin briefly characterizes it and its effect
(45) as being indeed all that could be asked of the judges, but of no moral weight to those
better acquainted than they were with Pelagius’ character and writings. In a word, they approved
his answers to them, as indeed they ought to have done; but they by no means approved,
but both they and he condemned, his heresies as expressed in his writings. To this
statement, Augustin appends an account of the origin of Pelagianism, and of his relations
to it from the beginning, which has the very highest value as history (46–49); and then speaks
of the character and doubtful practices of Pelagius (50–58), returning at the end (59–65) to
a thorough canvass of the value of the acquittal which he obtained by such doubtful practices
at the synod. He closes with an indignant account of the outrages which the Pelagians had
perpetrated on Jerome (66).</p>
<p>This valuable treatise is not, however, the only account of the historical origin of Pelagianism
that we have, from Augustin’s hands. Soon after the death of Innocent (March 12,
417), he found occasion to write a very long letter93 to the venerable Paulinus of Nola, in
which he summarized both the history of and the arguments against this “worldly philosophy.”
He begins by saying that he knows Paulinus has loved Pelagius as a servant of God,
but is ignorant in what way he now loves him. For he himself not only has loved him, but
loves him still, but in different ways. Once he loved him as apparently a brother in the true
faith: now he loves him in the longing that God will by His mercy free him from his noxious
opinions against God’s grace. He is not merely following report in so speaking of him: no
doubt report did for a long time represent this of him, but he gave the less heed to it because
report is accustomed to lie. But a book of his94 at last came into his hands, which left no
room for doubt, since in it he asserted repeatedly that God’s grace consisted of the gift to

man of the capacity to will and act, and thus reduced it to what is common to pagans and
Christians, to the ungodly and godly, to the faithful and infidels. He then gives a brief account
of the measures that had been taken against Pelagius, and passes on to a treatment of the
main matters involved in the controversy,—all of which gather around the one magic word
of “the grace of God.” He argues first that we are all lost,—in one mass and concretion of
perdition,—and that God’s grace alone makes us to differ. It is therefore folly to talk of deserving
the beginnings of grace. Nor can a faithful man say that he merits justification by
his faith, although it is given to faith; for at once he hears the words, “what hast thou that
thou didst not receive?” and learns that even the deserving faith is the gift of God. But if,
peering into God’s inscrutable judgments, we go farther, and ask why, from the mass of
Adam, all of which undoubtedly has fallen from one into condemnation, this vessel is made
for honor, that for dishonor,—we can only say that we do not know more than the fact; and
God’s reasons are hidden, but His acts are just. Certain it is that Paul teaches that all die in
Adam; and that God freely chooses, by a sovereign election, some out of that sinful mass,
to eternal life; and that He knew from the beginning to whom He would give this grace, and
so the number of the saints has always been fixed, to whom he gives in due time the Holy
Ghost. Others, no doubt, are called; but no others are elect, or “called according to his purpose.”
On no other body of doctrines, can it be possibly explained that some infants die
unbaptized, and are lost. Is God unjust to punish innocent children with eternal pains? And
are they not innocent if they are not partakers of Adam’s sin? And can they be saved from
that, save by the undeserved, and that is the gratuitous, grace of God? The account of the
Proceedings at the Palestinian synod is then taken up, and Pelagius’ position in his latest
writings is quoted and examined. “But why say more?” he adds.…“Ought they not, since
they call themselves Christians, to be more careful than the Jews that they do not stumble
at the stone of offence, while they subtly defend nature and free will just like philosophers
of this world who vehemently strive to be thought, or to think themselves, to attain for
themselves a happy life by the force of their own will? Let them take care, then, that they do
not make the cross of Christ of none effect by the wisdom of word (1 Cor. i. 17), and thus
stumble at the rock of offence. For human nature, even if it had remained in that integrity
in which it was created, could by no means have served its own Creator without His aid.
Since then, without God’s grace it could not keep the safety it had received, how can it
without God’s grace repair what it has lost?” With this profound view of the Divine immanence,
and of the necessity of His moving grace in all the acts of all his creatures, as over
against the heathen-deistic view of Pelagius, Augustin touched in reality the deepest point
in the whole controversy, and illustrated the essential harmony of all truth.95</p>

<pb n="52"/>
<p>The sharpest period of the whole conflict was now drawing on.96 Innocent’s death
brought Zosimus to the chair of the Roman See, and the efforts which he made to re-instate
Pelagius and Coelestius now began (September, 417). How little the Africans were likely to
yield to his remarkable demands, may be seen from a sermon97 which Augustin preached
on the 23d of September, while Zosimus’ letter (written on the 21st of September) was on
its way to Africa. The preacher took his text from John vi. 54–66. “We hear here,” he said,
“the true Master, the Divine Redeemer, the human Saviour, commending to us our ransom,
His blood. He calls His body food, and His blood drink; and, in commending such food
and drink, He says, ‘Unless you eat My flesh, and drink My blood, ye shall have no life in
you.’ What, then, is this eating and drinking, but to live? Eat life, drink life; you shall have
life, and life is whole. This will come,—that is, the body and blood of Christ will be life to
every one,—if what is taken visibly in the sacrament is in real truth spiritually eaten and
spiritually drunk. But that He might teach us that even to believe in Him is of gift, not of
merit, He said, ‘No one comes to Me, except the Father who sent Me draw him.’ Draw him,
not lead him. This violence is done to the heart, not the flesh. Why do you marvel? Believe,
and you come; love, and you are drawn. Think not that this is harsh and injurious violence;
it is soft, it is sweet; it is sweetness itself that draws you. Is not the sheep drawn when the
succulent herbage is shown to him? And I think that there is no compulsion of the body,
but an assembling of the desire. So, too, do you come to Christ; wish not to plan a long
journey,—when you believe, then you come. For to Him who is everywhere, one comes by
loving, not by taking a voyage. No doubt, if you come not, it is your work; but if you come,
it is God’s work. And even after you have come, and are walking in the right way, become
not proud, lest you perish from it: ‘happy are those that confide in Him,’ not in themselves,
but in Him. We are saved by grace, not of ourselves: it is the gift of God. Why do I continually
say this to you? It is because there are men who are ungrateful to grace, and attribute much
to unaided and wounded nature. It is true that man received great powers of free will at his
creation; but he lost them by sinning. He has fallen into death; he has been made weak; he
has been left half dead in the way, by robbers; the good Samaritan has lifted him up upon
his ass, and borne him to the inn. Why should we boast? But I am told that it is enough that
sins are remitted in baptism. But does the removal of sin take away weakness too? What!
will you not see that after pouring the oil and the wine into the wounds of the man left half
dead by the robbers, he must still go to the inn where his weakness may be healed? Nay, so
<note type="footnote">that this dispute was connected with a different way of regarding the relation of God’s providence to creation.”
As if Augustin did not see this too!</note>

long as we are in this life we bear a fragile body; it is only after we are redeemed from corruption
that we shall find no sin, and receive the crown of righteousness. Grace, that was
hidden in the Old Testament, is now manifest to the whole world. Even though the Jew may
be ignorant of it, why should Christians be enemies of grace? why presumptuous of themselves?
why ungrateful to grace? For, why did Christ come? Was not nature already
here,—that very nature by the praise of which you are beguiled? Was not the law here? But
the apostle says, ‘If righteousness is of the law, then is Christ dead in vain.’ What the apostle
says of the law, that we say to these men about nature: if righteousness is by nature, then
Christ is dead in vain. What then was said of the Jews, this we see repeated in these men.
They have a zeal for God: I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according
to knowledge. For, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their
own, they are not subject to the righteousness of God. My brethren, share my compassion.
Where you find such men, wish no concealment; let there be no perverse pity in you: where
you find them, wish no concealment at all. Contradict and refute, resist, or persuade them
to us. For already two councils have, in this cause, sent letters to the Apostolic See, whence
also rescripts have come back. The cause is ended: would that the error might some day
end! Therefore we admonish so that they may take notice, we teach so that they may be instructed,
we pray so that their way be changed.” Here is certainly tenderness to the persons
of the teachers of error; readiness to forgive, and readiness to go all proper lengths in recovering
them to the truth. But here is also absolute firmness as to the truth itself, and a manifesto
as to policy. Certainly, on the lines of the policy here indicated, the Africans fought out the
coming campaign. They met in council at the end of this year, or early in the next (418);
and formally replied to Zosimus, that the cause had been tried, and was finished, and that
the sentence that had been already pronounced against Pelagius and Coelestius should remain
in force until they should unequivocally acknowledge that “we are aided by the grace of God
through Christ, not only to know, but to do, what is right, and that in each single act; so
that without grace we are unable to have, think, speak, or do anything belonging to piety.”
As we may see Augustin’s hand in this, so, doubtless, we may recognize it in that remarkable
piece of engineering which crushed Zosimus’ plans within the next few months. There is,
indeed, no direct proof that it was due to Augustin, or to the Africans under his leading, or
to the Africans at all, that the State interfered in the matter; it is even in doubt whether the
action of the Empire was put forth as a rescript, or as a self-moved decree: but surely it is
difficult to believe that such a coup de théâtrecould have been prepared for Zosimus by
chance; and as it is well known, both that Augustin believed in the righteousness of civil
penalty for heresy, and invoked it on other occasions, and defended and used it on this, and
that he had influential friends at court with whom he was in correspondence, it seems, on
internal grounds, altogether probable that he was the Deus ex machinâ who let loose the

<pb n="54"/>
thunders of ecclesiastical and civil enactment simultaneously on the poor Pope’s devoted
head.</p>
<p>The “great African Council” met at Carthage, on the 1st of May, 418; and, after its decrees
were issued, Augustin remained at Carthage, and watched the effect of the combination of
which he was probably one of the moving causes. He had now an opportunity to betake
himself once more to his pen. While still at Carthage, at short notice, and in the midst of
much distraction, he wrote a large work, in two books which have come down to us under
the separate titles of On the Grace of Christ, and On Original Sin, at the instance of another
of those ascetic families which formed so marked a feature in those troubled times. Pinianus
and Melania, the daughter of Albina, were husband and wife, who, leaving Rome amid the
wars with Alaric, had lived in continence in Africa for some time, but now in Palestine had
separated, he to become head of a monastery, and she an inmate of a convent. While in
Africa, they had lived at Sagaste under the tutelage of Alypius, and in the enjoyment of the
friendship and instruction of Augustin. After retiring to Bethlehem, like the other holy ascetics
whom he had known in Africa, they kept up their relations with him. Like the others,
also, they became acquainted with Pelagius in Palestine, and were well-nigh deceived by
him. They wrote to Augustin that they had begged Pelagius to condemn in writing all that
had been alleged against him, and that he had replied in the presence of them all, that “he
anathematized the man who either thinks or says that the grace of God whereby Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners is not necessary, not only for every hour and for every
moment, but also for every act of our lives,” and asserted that “those who endeavor to disannul
it are worthy of everlasting punishment.”98 Moreover, they wrote that Pelagius had
read to them, out of his book that he had sent to Rome,99 his assertion “that infants ought
to be baptized with the same formula of sacramental words as adults.”100 They wrote that
they were delighted to hear these words from Pelagius, as they seemed exactly what they
had been desirous of hearing; and yet they preferred consulting Augustin about them, before
they were fully committed regarding them.101 It was in answer to this appeal, that the present
work was written; the two books of which take up the two points in Pelagius’ asseveration,—
the theme of the first being “the assistance of the Divine grace towards our justification,
by which God co-operates in all things for good to those who love Him, and whom He first
loved, giving to them that He may receive from them,”—while the subject of the second is

<pb n="55"/>
“the sin which by one man has entered the world along with death, and so has passed upon
all men.”102</p>
<p>The first book, On the Grace of Christ, begins by quoting and examining Pelagius’ anathema
of all those who deny that grace is necessary for every action (2 sq.). Augustin confesses
that this would deceive all who were not fortified by knowledge of Pelagius’ writings; but
asserts that in the light of them it is clear that he means that grace is always necessary, because
we need continually to remember the forgiveness of our sins, the example of Christ, the
teaching of the law, and the like. Then he enters (4 sq.) upon an examination of Pelagius’
scheme of human faculties, and quotes at length his account of them given in his book, In
Defence of Free Will, wherein he distinguishes between the possibilitas (posse), voluntas
(velle), and actio (esse), and declares that the first only is from God and receives aid from
God, while the others are entirely ours, and in our own power. Augustin opposes to this the
passage in Phil. ii. 12, 13 (6), and then criticises (7 sq.) Pelagius’ ambiguous acknowledgment
that God is to be praised for man’s good works, “because the capacity for any action on
man’s part is from God,” by which he reduces all grace to the primeval endowment of nature
with “capacity” (possibilitas, posse), and the help afforded it by the law and teaching. Augustin
points out the difference between law and grace, and the purpose of the former as a pedagogue
to the latter (9 sq.), and then refutes Pelagius’ further definition of grace as consisting in the
promise of future glory and the revelation of wisdom, by an appeal to Paul’s thorn in the
flesh, and his experience under its discipline (11 sq.). Pelagius’ illustrations from our senses,
of his theory of natural faculty, are then sharply tested (16); and the criticism on the whole
doctrine is then made and pressed (17 sq.), that it makes God equally sharer in our blame
for evil acts as in our praise for good ones, since if God does help, and His help is only His
gift to us of ability to act in either part, then He has equally helped to the evil deeds as to
the good. The assertion that this “capacity of either part” is the fecund root of both good
and evil is then criticised (19 sq.), and opposed to Matt. vii. 18, with the result of establishing
that we must seek two roots in our dispositions for so diverse results,—covetousness for
evil, and love for good,—not a single root for both in nature. Man’s “capacity,” it is argued,
is the root of nothing; but it is capable of both good and evil according to the moving cause,
which, in the case of evil, is man-originated, while, in the case of good, it is from God (21).
Next, Pelagius’ assertion that grace is given according to our merits (23 sq.) is taken up and
examined. It is shown, that, despite his anathema, Pelagius holds to this doctrine, and in so
extreme a form as explicitly to declare that man comes and cleaves to God by his freedom
of will alone, and without God’s aid. He shows that the Scriptures teach just the opposite
(24–26); and then points out how Pelagius has confounded the functions of knowledge and
love (27 sq.), and how he forgets that we cannot have merits until we love God, while John
<note type="footnote">102 On the Grace of Christ, 55.</note>

<pb n="56"/>
certainly asserts that God loved us first (1 John iv. 10). The representation that what grace
does is to render obedience easier (28–30), and the twin view that prayer is only relatively
necessary, are next criticised (32). That Pelagius never acknowledges real grace, is then
demonstrated by a detailed examination of all that he had written on the subject (31–45).
The book closes (46–80) with a full refutation of Pelagius’ appeal to Ambrose, as if he supported
him; and exhibition of Ambrose’s contrary testimony as to grace and its necessity.</p>
<p>The object of the second book—On Original Sin—is to show, that, in spite of Pelagius’
admissions as to the baptism of infants, he yet denies that they inherit original sin and
contends that they are born free from corruption. The book opens by pointing out that there
is no question as to Coelestius’ teaching in this matter (2–8), as he at Carthage refused to
condemn those who say that Adam’s sin injured no one but himself, and that infants are
born in the same state that Adam was in before the fall, and openly asserted at Rome that
there is no sin ex traduce. As for Pelagius, he is simply more cautious and mendacious than
Coelestius: he deceived the Council at Diospolis, but failed to deceive the Romans (5–13),
and, as a matter of fact (14–18), teaches exactly what Coelestius does. In support of this assertion,
Pelagius’ Defence of Free Will is quoted, wherein he asserts that we are born neither
good nor bad, “but with a capacity for either,” and “as without virtue, so without vice; and
previous to the action of our own proper will, that that alone is in man which God has
formed” (14). Augustin also quotes Pelagius’ explanation of his anathema against those who
say Adam’s sin injured only himself, as meaning that he has injured man by setting a bad
“example,” and his even more sinuous explanation of his anathema against those who assert
that infants are born in the same condition that Adam was in before he fell, as meaning that
they are infants and he was a man! (16–18). With this introduction to them, Augustin next
treats of Pelagius’ subterfuges (19–25), and then animadverts on the importance of the issue
(26–37), pointing out that Pelagianism is not a mere error, but a deadly heresy, and strikes
at the very centre of Christianity. A counter argument of the Pelagians is then answered
(38–45), “Does not the doctrine of original sin make marriage an evil thing?” No, says Augustin,
marriage is ordained by God, and is good; but it is a diseased good, and hence what
is born of it is a good nature made by God, but this good nature in a diseased condition,—the
result of the Devil’s work. Hence, if it be asked why God’s gift produces any thing for the
Devil to take possession of, it is to be answered that God gives his gifts liberally (Matt. v.
45), and makes men; but the Devil makes these men sinners (46). Finally, as Ambrose had
been appealed to in the former book, so at the end of this it is shown that he openly proclaimed
the doctrine of original sin, and here too, before Pelagius, condemned Pelagius (47
sq.).</p>
<p>What Augustin means by writing to Pinianus and his family that he was more oppressed
by work at Carthage than anywhere else, may perhaps be illustrated from his diligence in
preaching while in that capital. He seems to have been almost constantly in the pulpit,

<pb n="57"/>
during this period “of the sharpest conflict with them,”103 preaching against the Pelagians.
There is one series of his sermons, of the exact dates of which we can be pretty sure, which
may be adverted to here,—Sermons 151 and 152, preached early in October, 418; Sermon
155 on Oct. 14, 156 on Oct.17, and 26 on Oct. 18; thus following one another almost with
the regularity of the days. The first of these was based on Rom. vii. 15–25, which he declares
to contain dangerous words if not properly understood; for men are prone to sin, and when
they hear the apostle so speaking they do evil, and think they are like him. They are meant
to teach us, however, that the life of the just in this body is a war, not yet a triumph: the triumph
will come only when death is swallowed up in victory. It would, no doubt, be better
not to have an enemy than even to conquer. It would be better not to have evil desires: but
we have them; therefore, let us not go after them. If they rebel against us, let us rebel against
them; if they fight, let us fight; if they besiege, let us besiege: let us look only to this, that they
do not conquer. With some evil desires we are born: others we make, by bad habit. It is on
account of those with which we are born, that infants are baptized; that they may be freed
from the guilt of inheritance, not from any evil of custom, which, of course, they have not.
And it is on account of these, too, that our war must be endless: the concupiscence with
which we are born cannot be done away as long as we live; it may be diminished, but not
done away. Neither can the law free us, for it only reveals the sin to our greater apprehension.
Where, then, is hope, save in the superabundance of grace? The next sermon (152) takes up
the words in Rom. viii. 1–4, and points out that the inward aid of the Spirit brings all the
help we need. “We, like farmers in the field, work from without: but, if there were no one
who worked from within, the seed would not take root in the ground, nor would the sprout
arise in the field, nor would the shoot grow strong and become a tree, nor would branches
and fruit and leaves be produced. Therefore the apostle distinguishes between the work of
the workmen and of the Creator (1 Cor. iii. 6, 7). If God give not the increase, empty is this
sound within your ears; but if he gives, it avails somewhat that we plant and water, and our
labor is not in vain.” He then applies this to the individual, striving against his lusts; warns
against Manichean error; and distinguishes between the three laws,—the law of sin, the law
of faith, and the law of deeds,—defending the latter, the law of Moses, against the Manicheans;
and then he comes to the words of the text, and explains its chief phrases, closing thus:
“What other do we read here than that Christ is a sacrifice for sin?…Behold by what ‘sin’
he condemned sin: by the sacrifice which he made for sins, he condemned sin. This is the
law of the Spirit of life which has freed you from the law of sin and death. For that other
law, the law of the letter, the law that commands, is indeed good; ‘the commandment is holy
<note type="footnote">103 On the Gift of Perseverance, 55.</note>

<pb n="58"/>
and just and good:’ but ‘it was weak by the flesh,’ and what it commanded it could not bring
about in us. Therefore there is one law, as I began by saying, that reveals sin to you, and
another that takes it away: the law of the letter reveals sin, the law of grace takes it away.”
Sermon 155 covers the same ground, and more, taking the broader text, Rom. viii. 1–11,
and fully developing its teaching, especially as discriminating between the law of sin and
the law of Moses and the law of faith; the law of Moses being the holy law of God written
with His finger on the tables of stone, while the law of the Spirit of life is nothing other than
the same law written in the heart, as the prophet (Jer. xxx. 1, 33) clearly declares. So written,
it does not terrify from without, but soothes from within. Great care is also taken, lest by
such phrases as, “walk in the Spirit, not in the flesh,” “who shall deliver me from the body
of this death?” a hatred of the body should be begotten. “Thus you shall be freed from the
body of this death, not by having no body, but by having another one and dying no more.
If, indeed, he had not added, ‘of this death,’ perchance an error might have been suggested
to the human mind, and it might have been said, ‘You see that God does not wish us to have
a body.’ But He says, ‘the body of this death.’ Take away death, and the body is good. Let
our last enemy, death, be taken away, and my dear flesh will be mine for eternity. For no
one can ever ‘hate his own flesh.’ Although the ‘spirit lusts against the flesh, and the flesh
against the spirit,’ although there is now a battle in this house, yet the husband is seeking
by his strife not the ruin of, but concord with, his wife. Far be it, far be it, my brethren, that
the spirit should hate the flesh in lusting against it! It hates the vices of the flesh; it hates the
wisdom of the flesh; it hates the contention of death. This corruption shall put on incorruption,—
this mortal shall put on immortality; it is sown a natural body; it shall rise a spiritual
body; and you shall see full and perfect concord,—you shall see the creature praise the
Creator.” One of the special interests of such passages is to show, that, even at this early
date, Augustin was careful to guard his hearers from Manichean error while proclaiming
original sin. One of the sermons which, probably, was preached about this time (153), is
even entitled, “Against the Manicheans openly, but tacitly against the Pelagians,” and bears
witness to the early development of the method that he was somewhat later to use effectively
against Julian’s charges of Manicheanism against the catholics.104 Three days afterwards,
Augustin preached on the next few verses, Rom. viii. 12–17, but can scarcely be said to have
risen to the height of its great argument. The greater part of the sermon is occupied with a
discussion of the law, why it was given, how it is legitimately used, and its usefulness as a
pedagogue to bring us to Christ; then of the need of a mediator; and then, of what it is to
live according to the flesh, which includes living according to merely human nature; and
the need of mortifying the flesh in this world. All this, of course, gave full opportunity for
<note type="footnote">104 Compare, below, pp. lv-lviii. Neander, in the second volume (E.T.) of his History of the Christian Church,
discusses the matter in a very fair spirit.</note>

<pb n="59"/>
opposing the leading Pelagian errors; and the sermon is brought to a close by a direct polemic
against their assertion that the function of grace is only to make it more easy to do
what is right. “With the sail more easily, with the oar with more difficulty: nevertheless even
with the oar we can go. On a beast more easily, on foot with more difficulty: nevertheless
progress can be made on foot. It is not true! For the true Master who flatters no one, who
deceives no one,—the truthful Teacher and very Saviour to whom the most grievous pedagogue
has led us,—when he was speaking about good works, i.e., about the fruits of the
twigs and branches, did not say, ‘Without me, indeed, you can do something, but you will
do it more easily with me;’ He did not say, ‘You can make your fruit without me, but more
richly with me.’ He did not say this! Read what He said: it is the holy gospel,—bow the proud
necks! Augustin does not say this: the Lord says it. What says the Lord? ‘Without me you
can do nothing!’” On the very next day, he was again in the pulpit, and taking for his text
chiefly the ninety-fourth Psalm.105 The preacher began106 by quoting the sixth verse, and
laying stress on the words “our Maker.” ‘No Christian,’ he said, ‘doubted that God had made
him, and that in such a sense that God created not only the first man, from whom all have
descended, but that God to-day creates every man,—as He said to one of His saints, “Before
that I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.” At first He created man apart from man; now
He creates man from man: nevertheless, whether man apart from man, or man from man,
“it is He that made us, and not we ourselves.” Nor has He made us and then deserted us;
He has not cared to make us, and not cared to keep us. Will He who made us without being
asked, desert us when He is besought? But is it not just as foolish to say, as some say or are
ready to say, that God made them men, but they make themselves righteous? Why, then,
do we pray to God to make us righteous? The first man was created in a nature that was
without fault or flaw. He was made righteous: he did not make himself righteous; what he
did for himself was to fall and break his righteousness. This God did not do: He permitted
it, as if He had said, “Let him desert Me; let him find himself; and let his misery prove that
he has no ability without Me.” In this way God wished to show man what free will was worth
without God. O evil free will without God! Behold, man was made good; and by free will
man was made evil! When will the evil man make himself good by free will? When good,
he was not able to keep himself good; and now that he is evil, is he to make himself good?
Nay, behold, He that made us has also made us “His people” (Ps. xciv. 7). This is a distinguishing
gift. Nature is common to all, but grace is not. It is not to be confounded with
nature; but if it were, it would still be gratuitous. For certainly no man, before he existed,
deserved to come into existence. And yet God has made him, and that not like the beasts
or a stock or a stone, but in His own image. Who has given this benefit? He gave it who was
<note type="footnote">105 English version, xcv., see verse 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">106 Sermon 26.</note>

<pb n="60"/>
in existence: he received it who was not. And only He could do this, who calls the things
that are not as though they were: of whom the apostle says that “He chose us before the
foundation of the world.” We have been made in this world, and yet the world was not when
we were chosen. Ineffable! wonderful! They are chosen who are not: neither does He err in
choosing, nor choose in vain. He chooses, and has elect whom He is to create to be chosen:
He has them in Himself; not indeed in His nature, but in His prescience. Let us not, then,
glory in ourselves, or dispute against grace. If we are men, He made us. If we are believers,
He made us this too. He who sent the Lamb to be slain has, out of wolves, made us sheep.
This is grace. And it is an even greater grace than that grace of nature by which we were all
made men.’ “I am continually endeavouring to discuss such things as these,” said the
preacher, “against a new heresy which is attempting to rise; because I wish you to be fixed
in the good, untouched by the evil.…For, disputing against grace in favor of free will, they
became an offence to pious and catholic ears. They began to create horror; they began to
be avoided as a fixed pest; it began to be said of them, that they argued against grace. And
they found such a device as this: ‘Because I defend man’s free will, and say that free will is
sufficient in order that I may be righteous,’ says one, ‘I do not say that it is without the grace
of God.’ The ears of the pious are pricked up, and he who hears this, already begins to rejoice:
‘Thanks be to God! He does not defend free will without the grace of God! There is free will,
but it avails nothing without the grace of God.’ If, then, they do not defend free will without
the grace of God, what evil do they say? Expound to us, O teacher, what grace you mean?
‘When I say,’ he says, ‘the free will of man, you observe that I say “of man”?’ What then?
‘Who created man?’ God. ‘Who gave him free will?’ God. ‘If, then, God created man, and
God gave man free will, whatever man is able to do by free will, to whose grace does he owe
it, except to His who made him with free will?’ And this is what they think they say so acutely!
You see, nevertheless, my brethren, how they preach that general grace by which we were
created and by which we are men; and, of course, we are men in common with the ungodly,
and are Christians apart from them. It is this grace by which we are Christians, that we wish
them to preach, this that we wish them to acknowledge, this that we wish,—of which the
apostle says, ‘I do not make void the grace of God, for if righteousness is by the law, Christ
is dead in vain.’” Then the true function of the law is explained, as a revealer of our sinfulness,
and a pedagogue to lead us to Christ: the Manichean view of the Old Testament law is attacked,
but its insufficiency for salvation is pointed out; and so we are brought back to the
necessity of grace, which is illustrated from the story of the raising of the dead child in 2
Kings iv. 18–37,—the dead child being Adam; the ineffective staff (by which we ought to
walk), the law; but the living prophet, Christ with his grace, which we must preach. “The
prophetic staff was not enough for the dead boy: would dead nature itself have been enough?
Even this, by which we are made, although we nowhere read of it under this name, we nevertheless,
because it is given gratuitously, confess to be grace. But we show to you a greater

<pb n="61"/>
grace than this, by which we are Christians.…This is the grace by Jesus Christ our Lord: it
was He that made us,—both before we were at all, it was He that made us, and now, after
we are made, it is He that has made us all righteous,—and not we ourselves.” There was but
one mass of perdition from Adam, to which nothing was due but punishment; and from
that mass vessels have been made unto honor. “Rejoice because you have escaped; you have
escaped the death that was due,—you have received the life that was not due. ‘But,’ you ask,
‘why did He make me unto honor, and another unto dishonor?’ Will you who will not hear
the apostle saying, ‘O man, who art thou that repliest against God?’ hear Augustin?…Do
you wish to dispute with me? Nay, wonder with me, and cry out with me, ‘Oh the depth of
the riches!’ Let us both be afraid,—let us both cry out, ‘Oh the depth of the riches!’ Let us
both agree in fear, lest we perish in error.”</p>
<p>Augustin was not less busy with his pen, during these months, than with his voice. Quite
a series of letters belong to the last half of 418, in which he argues to his distant correspondents
on the same themes which he was so iterantly trying to make clear to his Carthaginian
auditors. One of the most interesting of these was written to a fellow-bishop, Optatus, on
the origin of the soul.107 Optatus, like Jerome, had expressed himself as favoring the theory
of a special creation of each at birth; and Augustin, in this letter as in the paper sent to
Jerome, lays great stress on so holding our theories on so obscure a matter as to conform
to the indubitable fact of the transmission of sin. This fact, such passages as 1 Cor. xv. 21
sq., Rom. v. 12 sq., make certain; and in stating this, Augustin takes the opportunity to
outline the chief contents of the catholic faith over against the Pelagian denial of original
sin and grace: that all are born under the contagion of death and in the bond of guilt; that
there is no deliverance except in the one Mediator, Christ Jesus; that before His coming
men received him as promised, now as already come, but with the same faith; that the law
was not intended to save, but to shut up under sin and so force us back upon the one Saviour;
and that the distribution of grace is sovereign. Augustin pries into God’s sovereign counsels
somewhat more freely here than is usual with him. “But why those also are created who, the
Creator foreknew, would belong to damnation, not to grace, the blessed apostle mentions
with as much succinct brevity as great authority. For he says that God, ‘wishing to show His
wrath and demonstrate His power,’ etc. (Rom. ix. 22). Justly, however, would he seem unjust
in forming vessels of wrath for perdition, if the whole mass from Adam were not condemned.
That, therefore, they are made on birth vessels of anger, belongs to the punishment due to
them; but that they are made by re-birth vessels of mercy, belongs to the grace that is not
due to them. God, therefore, shows his wrath,—not, of course, perturbation of mind, such
as is called wrath among men, but a just and fixed vengeance.…He shows also his power,
by which he makes a good use of evil men, and endows them with many natural and tem-
<note type="footnote">107 Epistle 190.</note>

<pb n="62"/>
poral goods, and bends their evil to admonition and instruction of the good by comparison
with it, so that these may learn from them to give thanks to God that they have been made
to differ from them, not by their own deserts which were of like kind in the same mass, but
by His pity.…But by creating so many to be born who, He foreknew, would not belong to
his grace, so that they are more by an incomparable multitude than those whom he deigned
to predestinate as children of the promise into the glory of His Kingdom,—He wished to
show by this very multitude of the rejected how entirely of no moment it is to the just God
what is the multitude of those most justly condemned. And that hence also those who are
redeemed from this condemnation may understand, that what they see rendered to so great
a part of the mass was the due of the whole of it,—not only of those who add many others
to original sin, by the choice of an evil will, but as well of so many children who are snatched
from this life without the grace of the Mediator, bound by no bond except that of original
sin alone.” With respect to the question more immediately concerning which the letter was
written, Augustin explains that he is willing to accept the opinion that souls are created for
men as they are born, if only it can be made plain that it is consistent with the original sin
that the Scriptures so clearly teach. In the paper sent to Jerome, the difficulties of creationism
are sufficiently urged; this letter is interesting on account of its statement of some of the
difficulties of traducianism also,—thus evidencing Augustin’s clear view of the peculiar
complexity of the problem, and justifying his attitude of balance and uncertainty between
the two theories. ‘The human understanding,’ he says, ‘can scarcely comprehend how a soul
arises from a parent’s soul in the offspring; or is transmitted to the offspring as a candle is
lighted from a candle and thence another fire comes into existence without loss to the former
one. Is there an incorporeal seed for the soul, which passes, by some hidden and invisible
channel of its own, from the father to the mother, when it is conceived in the woman? Or,
even more incredible, does it lie enfolded and hidden within the corporeal seed?’ He is lost
in wonder over the question whether, when conception does not take place, the immortal
seed of an immortal soul perishes; or, does the immortality attach itself to it only when it
lives? He even expresses the doubt whether traducianism will explain what it is called in to
explain, much better than creationism; in any case, who denies that God is the maker of
every soul? Isaiah (lvii. 16) says, “I have made every breath;” and the only question that can
arise is as to method,—whether He “makes every breath from the one first breath, just as
He makes every body of man from the one first body; or whether he makes new bodies indeed,
from the one body, but new souls out of nothing.” Certainly nothing but Scripture
can determine such a question; but where do the Scriptures speak unambiguously upon it?
The passages to which the creationists point only affirm the admitted fact that God makes
the soul; and the traducianists forget that the word “soul” in the Scriptures is ambiguous,
and can mean “man,” and even a “dead man.” What more can be done, then, than to assert

<pb n="63"/>
what is certain, viz., that sin is propagated, and leave what is uncertain in the doubt in which
God has chosen to place it?</p>
<p>This letter was written not long after the issue of Zosimus’ Tractoria, demanding the
signature of all to African orthodoxy; and Augustin sends Optatus “copies of the recent
letters which have been sent forth from the Roman see, whether specially to the African
bishops or generally to all bishops,” on the Pelagian controversy, “lest perchance they had
not yet reached” his correspondent, who, it is very evident, he was anxious should thoroughly
realize “that the authors, or certainly the most energetic and noted teachers,” of these new
heresies, “had been condemned in the whole Christian world by the vigilance of episcopal
councils aided by the Saviour who keeps His Church, as well as by two venerable overseers
of the Apostolical see, Pope Innocent and Pope Zosimus, unless they should show repentance
by being convinced and reformed.” To this zeal we owe it that the letter contains an extract
from Zosimus’ Tractoria, one of the two brief fragments of that document that have reached
our day.</p>
<p>There was another ecclesiastic in Rome, besides Zosimus, who was strongly suspected
of favoring the Pelagians,—the presbyter Sixtus, who afterwards became Pope Sixtus III.
But when Zosimus sent forth his condemnation of Pelagianism, Sixtus sent also a short letter
to Africa addressed to Aurelius of Carthage, which, though brief, indicated a considerable
vigor against the heresy which he was commonly believed to have before defended,108 and
which claimed him as its own.109 Some months afterwards, he sent another similar, but
longer, letter to Augustin and Alypius, more fully expounding his rejection of “the fatal
dogma” of Pelagius, and his acceptance of “that grace of God freely given by Him to small
and great, to which Pelagius’ dogma was diametrically opposed.” Augustin was overjoyed
with these developments. He quickly replied in a short letter110 in which he expresses the
delight he has in learning from Sixtus’ own hand that he is not a defender of Pelagius, but
a preacher of grace. And close upon the heels of this he sent another much longer letter,111
in which he discusses the subtler arguments of the Pelagians with an anxious care that seems
to bear witness to his desire to confirm and support his correspondent in his new opinions.
Both letters testify to Augustin’s approval of the persecuting measures which had been instituted
by the Roman see in obedience to the emperor; and urge on Sixtus his duty not only
to bring the open heretics to deserved punishment, but to track out those who spread their
poison secretly, and even to remember those whom he had formerly heard announcing the
error before it had been condemned, and who were now silent through fear, and to bring

them either to open recantation of their former beliefs, or to punishment. It is pleasanter
to recall our thoughts to the dialectic of these letters. The greater part of the second is given
to a discussion of the gratuitousness of grace, which, just because grace, is given to no preceding
merits. Many subtle objections to this doctrine were brought forward by the Pelagians.
They said that “free will was taken away if we asserted that man did not have even a good
will without the aid of God;” that we made “God an accepter of persons, if we believed that
without any preceding merits He had mercy on whom He would, and whom He would He
called, and whom He would He made religious;” that “it was unjust, in one and the same
case, to deliver one and punish another;” that, if such a doctrine is preached, “men who do
not wish to live rightly and faithfully, will excuse themselves by saying that they have done
nothing evil by living ill, since they have not received the grace by which they might live
well;” that it is a puzzle “how sin can pass over to the children of the faithful, when it has
been remitted to the parents in baptism;” that “children respond truly by the mouth of their
sponsors that they believe in remission of sins, but not because sins are remitted to them,
but because they believe that sins are remitted in the church or in baptism to those in whom
they are found, not to those in whom they do not exist,” and consequently they said that
“they were unwilling that infants should be so baptized unto remission of sins as if this remission
took place in them,” for (they contend) “they have no sin; but they are to be baptized,
although without sin, with the same rite of baptism through which remission of sins takes
place in any that are sinners.” This last objection is especially interesting 112 because it furnishes
us with the reply which the Pelagians made to the argument that Augustin so strongly
pressed against them from the very act and ritual of baptism, as implying remission of
sins.113 His rejoinder to it here is to point to the other parts of the same ritual, and to ask
why, then, infants are exorcised and exsufflated in baptism. “For, it cannot be doubted that
this is done fictitiously, if the Devil does not rule over them; but if he rules over them, and
they are therefore not falsely exorcised and exsufflated, why does that prince of sinners rule
over them except because of sin?” On the fundamental matter of the gratuitousness of grace,
this letter is very explicit. “If we seek for the deserving of hardening, we shall find it.…But
if we seek for the deserving of pity, we shall not find it; for there is none, lest grace be made
a vanity if it is not given gratis, but rendered to merits. But, should we say that faith preceded
and in it there is desert of grace, what desert did man have before faith that he should receive
faith? For, what did he have that he did not receive? and if he received it, why does he glory
as if he received it not? For as man would not have wisdom, understanding, prudence,
fortitude, knowledge, piety, fear of God, unless he had received (according to the prophet)

the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of prudence and fortitude, of knowledge and piety
and the fear of God; as he would not have justice, love, continence, except the spirit was
received of whom the apostle says, ‘For you did not receive the spirit of fear, but of virtue,
and love, and continence:’ so he would not have faith unless he received the spirit of faith
of whom the same apostle says, ‘Having then the same spirit of faith, according to what is
written, “I believed and therefore spoke,” we too believe and therefore speak.’ But that He
is not received by desert, but by His mercy who has mercy on whom He will, is manifestly
shown where he says of himself, ‘I have obtained mercy to be faithful.’” “If we should say
that the merit of prayer precedes, that the gift of grace may follow,…even prayer itself is
found among the gifts of grace” (Rom. viii. 26). “It remains, then, that faith itself, whence
all righteousness takes beginning;…it remains, I say, that even faith itself is not to be attributed
to the human will which they extol, nor to any preceding merits, since from it begin
whatever good things are merits: but it is to be confessed to be the gratuitous gift of God,
since we consider it true grace, that is, without merits, inasmuch as we read in the same
epistle, ‘God divides out the measure of faith to each’ (Rom. xii. 3). Now, good works are
done by man, but faith is wrought in man, and without it these are not done by any man.
For all that is not of faith is sin” (Rom. xiv. 23).</p>
<p>By the same messenger who carried this important letter to Sixtus, Augustin sent also
a letter to Mercator,114 an African layman who was then apparently at Rome, but who was
afterwards (in 429) to render service by instructing the Emperor Theodosius as to the nature
and history of Pelagianism, and so preventing the appeal of the Pelagians to him from being
granted. Now he appears as an inquirer: Augustin, while at Carthage, had received a letter
from him in which he had consulted him on certain questions that the Pelagians had raised,
but in such a manner as to indicate his opposition to them. Press of business had compelled
the postponement of the reply until this later date. One of the questions that Mercator had
put concerned the Pelagian account of infants sharing in the one baptism unto remission
of sins, which we have seen Augustin answering when writing to Sixtus. In this letter he
replies: “Let them, then, hear the Lord (John iii. 36). Infants, therefore, who made believers
by others, by whom they are brought to baptism, are, of course, unbelievers by others, if
they are in the hands of such as do not believe that they should be brought, inasmuch as
they believe they are nothing profited; and accordingly, if they believe by believers, and have
eternal life, they are unbelievers by unbelievers, and shall not see life, but the wrath of God
abideth on them. For it is not said, ‘it comes on them,’ but ‘it abideth on them,’ because it
was on them from the beginning, and will not be taken from them except by the grace of
God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.…Therefore, when children are baptized, the confession
is made that they are believers, and it is not to be doubted that those who are not believers
<note type="footnote">114 Epistle 193.</note>

<pb n="66"/>
are condemned: let them, then, dare to say now, if they can, that they contract no evil from
their origin to be condemned by the just God, and have no contagion of sin.” The other
matter on which Mercator sought light concerned the statement that universal death proved
universal sin: 115 he reported that the Pelagians replied that not even death was universal,—
that Enoch, for instance, and Elijah, had not died. Augustin adds those who are to be
found living at the second advent, who are not to die, but be “changed;” and replies that
Rom. v. 12 is perfectly explicit that there is no death in the world except that which comes
from sin, and that God a Saviour, and we cannot at all “deny that He is able to do that, now,
in any that he wishes, without death, which we undoubtingly believe is to be done in so
many after death.” He adds that the difficult question is not why Enoch and Elijah did not
die, if death is the punishment of sin; but why, such being the case, the justified ever die;
and he refers his correspondent to his book On the Baptism of Infants116 for a resolution of
this greater difficulty.</p>
<p>It was probably at the very end of 418 that Augustin wrote a letter of some length117 to
Asellicus, in reply to one which he had written on “avoiding the deception of Judaism,” to
the primate of the Bizacene province, and which that ecclesiastic had sent to Augustin for
answering. He discusses in this the law of the Old Testament. He opens by pointing out that
the apostle forbids Christians to Judaize (Gal. ii. 14–16), and explains that it is not merely
the ceremonial law that we may not depend upon, “but also what is said in the law, ‘Thou
shalt not covet’ (which no one, of course, doubts is to be said to Christians too), does not
justify man, except by faith in Jesus Christ and the grace of God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.” He then expounds the use of the law: “This, then, is the usefulness of the law: that it
shows man to himself, so that he may know his weakness, and see how, by the prohibition,
carnal concupiscence is rather increased than healed.…The use of the law is, thus, to convince
man of his weakness, and force him to implore the medicine of grace that is in Christ.”
“Since these things are so,” he adds, “those who rejoice that they are Israelites after the flesh,
and glory in the law apart from the grace of Christ, these are those concerning whom the
apostle said that ‘being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their own,
they are not subject to God’s righteousness;’ since he calls ‘God’s righteousness’ that which
is from God to man; and ‘their own,’ what they think that the commandments suffice for
them to do without the help and gift of Him who gave the law. But they are like those who,
while they profess to be Christians, so oppose the grace of Christ, that they suppose that
they fulfil the divine commands by human powers, and, ‘wishing to establish their own,’
are ‘not subject to the righteousness of God,’ and so, not indeed in name, but yet in error,

Judaize. This sort of men found heads for themselves in Pelagius and Coelestius, the most
acute asserters of this impiety, who by God’s recent judgment, through his diligent and
faithful servants, have been deprived even of catholic communion, and, on account of an
impenitent heart, persist still in their condemnation.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of 419, a considerable work was published by Augustin on one of the
more remote corollaries which the Pelagians drew from his teachings. It had come to his
ears, that they asserted that his doctrine condemned marriage: “if only sinful offspring come
from marriage,” they asked, “is not marriage itself made a sinful thing?” The book which
Augustin composed in answer to this query, he dedicated to, and sent along with an explanatory
letter to, the Comes Valerius, a trusted servant of the Emperor Honorius, and one of
the most steady opponents at court of the Pelagian heresy. Augustin explains118 why he has
desired to address the book to him: first, because Valerius was a striking example of those
continent husbands of which that age furnishes us with many instances, and, therefore, the
discussion would have especial interest for him; secondly, because of his eminence as an
opponent of Pelagianism; and, thirdly, because Augustin had learned that he had read a
Pelagian document in which Augustin was charged with condemning marriage by defending
original sin. 119 The book in question is the first book of the treatise On Marriage and
Concupiscence. It is, naturally, tinged, or rather stained, with the prevalent ascetic notions
of the day. Its doctrine is that marriage is good, and God is the maker of the offspring that
comes from it, although now there can be no begetting and hence no birth without sin. Sin
made concupiscence, and now concupiscence perpetuates sinners. The specific object of
the work, as it states it itself, is “to distinguish between the evil of carnal concupiscence,
from which man, who is born therefrom, contracts original sin, and the good of marriage”
(I. 1). After a brief introduction, in which he explains why he writes, and why he addresses
his book to Valerius (1–2), Augustin points out that conjugal chastity, like its higher sistergrace
of continence, is God’s gift. Thus copulation, but only for the propagation of children,
has divine allowance (3–5). Lust, or “shameful concupiscence,” however, he teaches, is not
of the essence, but only an accident, of marriage. It did not exist in Eden, although true
marriage existed there; but arose from, and therefore only after, sin (6–7). Its addition to
marriage does not destroy the good of marriage: it only conditions the character of the offspring
(8). Hence it is that the apostle allows marriage, but forbids the “disease of desire”
(1 Thess. iv. 3–5); and hence the Old-Testament saints were even permitted more than one
wife, because, by multiplying wives, it was not lust, but offspring, that was increased (9–10).
<note type="footnote">118 On Marriage and Concupiscence, i. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">119 Compare the Benedictine Preface to The Unfinished Work.</note>

<pb n="68"/>
Nevertheless, fecundity is not to be thought the only good of marriage: true marriage can
exist without offspring, and even without cohabitation (11–13), and cohabitation is now,
under the New Testament, no longer a duty as it was under the Old Testament (14–15), but
the apostle praises continence above it. We must, then, distinguish between the goods of
marriage, and seek the best (16–19). But thus it follows that it is not due to any inherent
and necessary evil in marriage, but only to the presence, now, of concupiscence in all cohabitation,
that children are born under sin, even the children of the regenerate, just as from
the seed of olives only oleasters grow (20–24). And yet again, concupiscence is not itself sin
in the regenerate; it is remitted as guilt in baptism: but it is the daughter of sin, and it is the
mother of sin, and in the unregenerate it is itself sin, as to yield to it is even to the regenerate
(25–39). Finally, as so often, the testimony of Ambrose is appealed to, and it is shown that
he too teaches that all born from cohabitation are born guilty (40). In this book, Augustin
certainly seems to teach that the bond of connection by which Adam’s sin is conveyed to
his offspring is not mere descent, or heredity, or mere inclusion in him, in a realistic sense,
as partakers of the same numerical nature, but concupiscence. Without concupiscence in
the act of generation, the offspring would not be a partaker of Adam’s sin. This he had taught
also previously, as, e.g., in the treatise On Original Sin, from which a few words may be
profitably quoted as succinctly summing up the teaching of this book on the subject: “It is,
then, manifest, that that must not be laid to the account of marriage, in the absence of which
even marriage would still have existed.…Such, however, is the present condition of mortal
men, that the connubial intercourse and lust are at the same time in action.…Hence it follows
that infants, although incapable of sinning, are yet not born without the contagion of
sin,…not, indeed, because of what is lawful, but on account of that which is unseemly: for,
from what is lawful, nature is born; from what is unseemly, sin” (42).</p>
<p>Towards the end of the same year (419), Augustin was led to take up again the vexed
question of the origin of the soul,—both in a new letter to Optatus,120 by the zeal of the
same monk, Renatus, who had formerly brought Optatus’ inquiries to his notice,—in an
elaborate treatise entitled On the Soul and its Origin, by way of reply to a rash adventure of
a young man named Vincentius Victor, who blamed him for his uncertainty on such a
subject, and attempted to determine all the puzzles of the question, though, as Augustin
insists, on assumptions that were partly Pelagian and partly worse. Optatus had written in
the hope that Augustin had heard by this time from Jerome, in reply to the treatise he had
sent him on this subject. Augustin, in answering his letter, expresses his sorrow that he has
not yet been worthy of an answer from Jerome, although five years had passed away since
he wrote, but his continued hope that such an answer will in due time come. For himself,
he confesses that he has not yet been able to see how the soul can contract sin from Adam
<note type="footnote">120 Epistle 202, bis. Compare Epistle 190.</note>

<pb n="69"/>
and yet not itself be contracted from Adam; and he regrets that Optatus, although holding
that God creates each soul for its birth, has not sent him the proofs on which he depends
for that opinion, nor met its obvious difficulties. He rebukes Optatus for confounding the
question of whether God makes the soul, with the entirely different one of how he makes
it, whether ex propagine or sive propagine. No one doubts that God makes the soul, as no
one doubts that He makes the body. But when we consider how he makes it, sobriety and
vigilance become necessary lest we should unguardedly fall into the Pelagian heresy. Augustin
defends his attitude of uncertainty, and enumerates the points as to which he has no doubt:
viz., that the soul is spirit, not body; that it is rational or intellectual; that it is not of the
nature of God, but is so far a mortal creature that it is capable of deterioration and of alienation
from the life of God, and so far immortal that after this life it lives on in bliss or punishment
forever; that it was not incarnated because of, or according to, preceding deserts
acquired in a previous existence, yet that it is under the curse of sin which it derives from
Adam, and therefore in all cases alike needs redemption in Christ.</p>
<p>The whole subject of the nature and origin of the soul, however, is most fully discussed
in the four books which are gathered together under the common title of On the Soul and
its Origin. Vincentius Victor was a young layman who had recently been converted from
the Rogatian heresy; on being shown by his friend Peter, a presbyter, a small work of Augustin’s
on the origin of the soul, he expressed surprise that so great a man could profess
ignorance on a matter so intimate to his very being, and, receiving encouragement, wrote
a book for Peter in which he attacked and tried to solve all the difficulties of the subject.
Peter received the work with transports of delighted admiration; but Renatus, happening
that way, looked upon it with distrust, and, finding that Augustin was spoken of in it with
scant courtesy, felt it his duty to send him a copy of it, which he did in the summer of 419.
It was probably not until late in the following autumn that Augustin found time to take up
the matter; but then he wrote to Renatus, to Peter, and two books to Victor himself, and it
is these four books together which constitute the treatise that has come down to us. The
first book is a letter to Renatus, and is introduced by an expression of thanks to him for
sending Victor’s book, and of kindly feeling towards and appreciation for the high qualities
of Victor himself (1–3). Then Victor’s errors are pointed out,—as to the nature of the soul
(4–9), including certain far-reaching corollaries that flow from these (10–15), as well as, as
to the origin of the soul (16–30); and the letter closes with some remarks on the danger of
arguing from the silence of Scripture (31), on the self-contradictions of Victor (34), and on
the errors that must be avoided in any theory of the origin of the soul that hopes to be acceptable,—
to wit, that souls become sinful by an alien original sin, that unbaptized infants
need no salvation, that souls sinned in a previous state, and that they are condemned for
sins which they have not committed but would have committed had they lived longer. The
second book is a letter to Peter, warning him of the responsibility that rests on him as Victor’s

<pb n="70"/>
trusted friend and a clergyman, to correct Victor’s errors, and reproving him for the uninstructed
delight he had taken in Victor’s crudities. It opens by asking Peter what was the
occasion of the great joy which Victor’s book brought him? could it be that he learned from
it, for the first time, the old and primary truths it contained? (2–3); or was it due to the new
errors that it proclaimed,—seven of which he enumerates? (4–16). Then, after animadverting
on the dilemma in which Victor stood, of either being forced to withdraw his violent assertion
of creationism, or else of making God unjust in His dealings with new souls (17), he speaks
of Victor’s unjustifiable dogmatism in the matter (18–21), and closes with severely solemn
words to Peter on his responsibility in the premises (22–23). In the third and fourth books,
which are addressed to Victor, the polemic, of course, reaches its height. The third book is
entirely taken up with pointing out to Victor, as a father to a son, the errors into which he
has fallen, and which, in accordance with his professions of readiness for amendment, he
ought to correct. Eleven are enumerated: 1. That the soul was made by God out of Himself
(3–7); 2. That God will continuously create souls forever (8); 3. That the soul has desert of
good before birth (9); 4. (contradictingly), That the soul has desert of evil before birth (10);
5. That the soul deserved to be sinful before any sin (11); 6. That unbaptized infants are
saved (12); 7. That what God predestinates may not occur (13); 8. That Wisd. iv. 1 is spoken
of infants (14); 9. That some of the mansions with the Father are outside of God’s kingdom
(15–17); 10. That the sacrifice of Christ’s blood may be offered for the unbaptized (18); 11.
That the unbaptized may attain at the resurrection even to the kingdom of heaven (19). The
book closes by reminding Victor of his professions of readiness to correct his errors, and
warning him against the obstinacy that makes the heretic (20–23). The fourth book deals
with the more personal elements of the controversy, and discusses the points in which
Victor had expressed dissent from Augustin. It opens with a statement of the two grounds
of complaint that Victor had urged against Augustin; viz., that he refused to express a confident
opinion as to the origin of the soul, and that he affirmed that the soul was not corporeal,
but spirit (1–2). These two complaints are then taken up at length (2–16 and 17–37).
To the first, Augustin replies that man’s knowledge is at best limited, and often most limited
about the things nearest to him; we do not know the constitution of our bodies; and, above
most others, this subject of the origin of the soul is one on which no one but God is a competent
witness. Who remembers his birth? Who remembers what was before birth? But this
is just one of the subjects on which God has not spoken unambiguously in the Scriptures.
Would it not be better, then, for Victor to imitate Augustin’s cautious ignorance, than that
Augustin should imitate Victor’s rash assertion of errors? That the soul is not corporeal,
Augustin argues (18–35) from the Scriptures and from the phenomena of dreams; and then
shows, in opposition to Victor’s trichotomy, that the Scriptures teach the identity of “soul”
and “spirit” (36–37). The book closes with a renewed enumeration of Victor’s eleven errors
(38), and a final admonition to his rashness (39). It is pleasant to know that Augustin found

<pb n="71"/>
in this case, also, that righteousness is the fruit of the faithful wounds of a friend. Victor
accepted the rebuke, and professed his better instruction at the hands of his modest but
resistless antagonist.</p>
<p>The controversy now entered upon a new stage. Among the evicted bishops of Italy
who refused to sign Zosimus’ Epistola Tractoria, Julian of Eclanum was easily the first, and
at this point he appears as the champion of Pelagianism. It was a sad fate that arrayed this
beloved son of his old friend against Augustin, just when there seemed to be reason to hope
that the controversy was at an end, and the victory won, and the plaudits of the world were
greeting him as the saviour of the Church.121 But the now fast-aging bishop was to find,
that, in this “very confident young man,” he had yet to meet the most persistent and most
dangerous advocate of the new doctrines that had arisen. Julian had sent, at an earlier period,
two letters to Zosimus, one of which has come down to us as a “Confession of Faith,” and
the other of which attempted to approach Augustinian forms of speech as much as possible;
the object of both being to gain standing ground in the Church for the Italian Pelagians.
Now he appears as a Pelagian controversialist; and in opposition to the book On Marriage
and Concupiscence, which Augustin had sent Valerius, he published an extended work in
four thick books addressed to Turbantius. Extracts from the first of these books were sent
by some one to Valerius, and were placed by him in the hands of Alypius, who was then in
Italy, for transmission to Augustin. Meanwhile, a letter had been sent to Rome by Julian,122
designed to strengthen the cause of Pelagianism there; and a similar one, in the names of
the eighteen Pelagianizing Italian bishops, was addressed to Rufus, bishop of Thessalonica,
and representative of the Roman see in that portion of the Eastern Empire which was regarded
as ecclesiastically a part of the West, the design of which was to obtain the powerful support
of this important magnate, perhaps, also, a refuge from persecution within his jurisdiction.
These two letters came into the hands of the new Pope, Boniface, who gave them also to
Alypius for transmission to Augustin. Thus provided, Alypius returned to Africa. The tactics
of all these writings of Julian were essentially the same; he attempted not so much to defend
Pelagianism, as to attack Augustinianism, and thus literally to carry the war into Africa. He
insisted that the corruption of nature which Augustin taught was nothing else than
Manicheism; that the sovereignty of grace, as taught by him, was only the attribution of
“acceptance of persons,” and partiality, to God; and that his doctrine of predestination was
mere fatalism. He accused the anti-Pelagians of denying the goodness of the nature that
God had created, of the marriage that He had ordained, of the law that He had given, of the
free will that He had implanted in man, as well as the perfection of His saints.123 He insisted

<note type="footnote">122 Julian afterwards repudiated this letter, perhaps because of some falsifications it had suffered; it seems
to have been certainly his.</note>

<pb n="72"/>
that this teaching also did dishonour to baptism itself which it professed so to honour,
inasmuch as it asserted the continuance of concupiscence after baptism,—and thus taught
that baptism does not take away sins, but only shaves them off as one shaves his beard, and
leaves the roots whence the sins may grow anew, and need cutting down again. He complained
bitterly of the way in which Pelagianism had been condemned,—that bishops had
been compelled to sign a definition of dogma, not in council assembled, but sitting at home;
and he demanded a rehearing of the whole case before a lawful council, lest the doctrine of
the Manichees should be forced upon the acceptance of the world.</p>
<p>Augustin felt a strong desire to see the whole work of Julian against his book On Marriage
and Concupiscence before he undertook a reply to the excerpts sent him by Valerius; but he
did not feel justified in delaying obedience to that officer’s request, and so wrote at once
two treatises, one an answer to these excerpts, for the benefit of Valerius, constituting the
second book of his On Marriage and Concupiscence; and the other, a far more elaborate
examination of the letters sent by Boniface, which bears the title, Against Two Letters of the
Pelagians. The purpose of the second book of On Marriage and Concupiscence, Augustin
himself states, in its introductory sentences, to be “to reply to the taunts of his adversaries
with all the truthfulness and scriptural authority he could command.” He begins (2) by
identifying the source of the extracts forwarded to him by Valerius, with Julian’s work against
his first book, and then remarks upon the garbled form in which he is quoted in them (3–6),
and passes on to state and refute Julian’s charge that the catholics had turned Manicheans
(7–9). At this point, the refutation of Julian begins in good earnest, and the method that he
proposes to use is stated; viz., to adduce the adverse statements, and refute them one by one
(10). Beginning at the beginning, he quotes first the title of the paper sent him, which declares
that it is directed against “those who condemn matrimony, and ascribe its fruit to the Devil”
(11), which certainly, says Augustin, does not describe him or the catholics. The next twenty
chapters (10–30), accordingly, following Julian’s order, labour to prove that marriage is
good, and ordained by God, but that its good includes fecundity indeed, but not concupiscence,
which arose from sin, and contracts sin. It is next argued, that the doctrine of original sin
does not imply an evil origin for man (31–51); and in the course of this argument, the following
propositions are especially defended: that God makes offspring for good and bad
alike, just as He sends the rain and sunshine on just and unjust (31–34); that God makes
everything to be found in marriage except its flaw, concupiscence (35–40); that marriage
is not the cause of original sin, but only the channel through which it is transmitted (41–47);
and that to assert that evil cannot arise from what is good leaves us in the clutches of that
very Manicheism which is so unjustly charged against the catholics—for, if evil be not
eternal, what else was there from which it could arise but something good? (48–51). In
concluding, Augustin recapitulates, and argues especially, that shameful concupiscence is
of sin, and the author of sin, and was not in paradise (52–54); that children are made by

<pb n="73"/>
God, and only marred by the Devil (55); that Julian, in admitting that Christ died for infants,
admits that they need salvation (56); that what the Devil makes in children is not a substance,
but an injury to a substance (57–58); and that to suppose that concupiscence existed in any
form in paradise introduces incongruities in our conception of life in that abode of
primeval bliss (59–60).</p>
<p>The long and important treatise, Against Two Letters of the Pelagians, consists of four
books, the first of which replies to the letter sent to Rome, and the other three to that sent
to Thessalonica. After a short introduction, in which he thanks Boniface for his kindness,
and gives reasons why heretical writings should be answered (1–3), Augustin begins at once
to rebut the calumnies which the letter before him brings against the catholics (4–28). These
are seven in number: 1. That the catholics destroy free will; to which Augustin replies that
none are “forced into sin by the necessity of their flesh,” but all sin by free will, though no
man can have a righteous will save by God’s grace, and that it is really the Pelagians that
destroy free will by exaggerating it (4–8); 2. That Augustin declares that such marriage as
now exists is not of God (9); 3. That sexual desire and intercourse are made a device of the
Devil, which is sheer Manicheism (10–11); 4. That the Old-Testament saints are said to have
died in sin (12); 5. That Paul and the other apostles are asserted to have been polluted by
lust all their days; Augustin’s answer to which includes a running commentary on Rom. vii.
7 sq., in which (correcting his older exegesis) he shows that Paul is giving here a transcript
of his own experience as a typical Christian (13–24); 6. That Christ is said not to have been
free from sin (25); 7. That baptism does not give complete remission of sins, but leaves roots
from which they may again grow; to which Augustin replies that baptism does remit all sins,
but leaves concupiscence, which, although not sin, is the source of sin (26–28). Next, the
positive part of Julian’s letter is taken up, and his profession of faith against the catholics
examined (29–41). The seven affirmations that Julian makes here are designed as the obverse
of the seven charges against the catholics. He believed: 1. That free will is in all by nature,
and could not perish by Adam’s sin (29); 2. That marriage, as now existent, was ordained
by God (30); 3. That sexual impulse and virility are from God (31–35); 4. That men are
God’s work, and no one is forced to do good or evil unwillingly, but are assisted by grace
to good, and incited by the Devil to evil (36–38); 5. That the saints of the Old Testament
were perfected in righteousness here, and so passed into eternal life (39); 6. That the grace
of Christ (ambiguously meant) is necessary for all, and all children—even those of baptized
parents—are to be baptized (40); 7. And that baptism gives full cleansing from all sins; to
which Augustin pointedly asks, “What does it do for infants, then?” (41). The book concludes
with an answer to Julian’s conclusion, in which he demands a general council, and charges
the catholics with Manicheism.</p>
<p>The second, third, and fourth books deal with the letter to Rufus in a somewhat similar
way, the second and third books being occupied with the calumnies brought against the

<pb n="74"/>
catholics, and the fourth with the claims made by the Pelagians. The second begins by repelling
the charge of Manicheism brought against the catholics (1–4), to which the pointed
remark is added, that the Pelagians cannot hope to escape condemnation because they are
willing to condemn another heresy; and then defends (with less success) the Roman clergy
against the charge of prevarication in their dealing with the Pelagians (5–8), in the course
of which all that can be said in defence of Zosimus’ wavering policy is said well and strongly.
Next the charges against catholic teaching are taken up and answered (9–16), especially the
two important accusations that they maintain fate under the name of grace (9–12), and that
they make God an “accepter of persons” (13–16). Augustin’s replies to these charges are in
every way admirable. The charge of “fate” rests solely on the catholic denial that grace is
given according to preceding merits; but the Pelagians do not escape the same charge when
they acknowledge that the “fates” of baptized and unbaptized infants do differ. It is, in truth,
not a question of “fate,” but of gratuitous bounty; and “it is not the catholics that assert fate
under the name of grace, but the Pelagians that choose to call divine grace by the name of
‘fate’” (12). As to “acceptance of persons,” we must define what we mean by that. God certainly
does not accept one’s “person” above another’s; He does not give to one rather than
to another because He sees something to please Him in one rather than another: quite the
opposite. He gives of His bounty to one while giving all their due to all, as in the parable
(Matt. xx. 9 sq.). To ask why He does this, is to ask in vain: the apostle answers by not answering
(Rom. ix.); and before the dumb infants, who are yet made to differ, all objection
to God is dumb. From this point, the book becomes an examination of the Pelagian doctrine
of prevenient merit (17–23), concluding that God gives all by grace from the beginning to
the end of every process of doing good. 1. He commands the good; 2. He gives the desire to
do it; and, 3. He gives the power to do it: and all, of His gratuitous mercy. The third book
continues the discussion of the calumnies of the Pelagians against the catholics, and enumerates
and answers six of them: viz., that the catholics teach, 1. That the Old-Testament law
was given, not to justify the obedient, but to serve as cause of greater sin (2–3); 2. That
baptism does not give entire remission of sins, but the baptized are partly God’s and partly
the Devil’s (4–5); 3. That the Holy Ghost did not assist virtue in the Old Testament (6–13);
4. That the Bible saints were not holy, but only less wicked than others (14–15); 5. That
Christ was a sinner by necessity of His flesh (doubtless, Julian’s inference from the doctrine
of race-sin) (16); 6. That men will begin to fulfil God’s commandments only after the resurrection
(17–23). Augustin shows that at the basis of all these calumnies lies either misapprehension
or misrepresentation; and, in concluding the book, enumerates the three chief
points in the Pelagian heresy, with the five claims growing out of them, of which they most
boasted, and then elucidates the mutual relations of the three parties, catholics, Pelagians,
and Manicheans, with reference to these points, showing that the catholics stand asunder
from both the others, and condemn both (24–27). This conclusion is really a preparation

<pb n="75"/>
for the fourth book, which takes up these five Pelagian claims, and, after showing the catholic
position on them all in brief (1–3), discusses them in turn (4–19): viz., the praise of the
creature (4–8), the praise of marriage (9), the praise of the law (10–11), the praise of free
will (12–16), and the praise of the saints (17–18). At the end, Augustin calls on the Pelagians
to cease to oppose the Manicheans, only to fall into as bad heresy as theirs (19); and then,
in reply to their accusation that the catholics were proclaiming novel doctrine, he adduces
the testimony of Cyprian and Ambrose, both of whom had received Pelagius’ praise, on
each of the three main points of Pelagianism (20–32), 124 and then closes with the declaration
that the “impious and foolish doctrine,” as they called it, of the catholics, is immemorial
truth (33), and with a denial of the right of the Pelagians to ask for a general council to
condemn them (34). All heresies do not need an ecumenical synod for their condemnation;
usually it is best to stamp them out locally, and not allow what may be confined to a corner
to disturb the whole world.</p>
<p>These books were written late in 420, or early in 421, and Alypius appears to have conveyed
them to Italy during the latter year. Before its close, Augustin, having obtained and
read the whole of Julian’s attack on the first book of his work On Marriage and Concupiscence,
wrote out a complete answer to it,125—a task that he was all the more anxious to complete,
on perceiving that the extracts sent by Valerius were not only all from the first book of Julian’s
treatise, but were somewhat altered in the extracting. The resulting work, Against Julian,
one of the longest that he wrote in the whole course of the Pelagian controversy, shows its
author at his best: according to Cardinal Noris’s judgment, he appears in it “almost divine,”
and Augustin himself clearly set great store by it. In the first book of this noble treatise, after
professing his continued love for Julian, “whom he was unable not to love, whatever he
[Julian] should say against him” (35), he undertakes to show that in affixing the opprobrious
name of Manicheans on those who assert original sin, Julian is incriminating many of the
most famous fathers, both of the Latin and Greek Churches. In proof of this, he makes appropriate
quotations from Irenæus, Cyprian, Reticius, Olympius, Hilary, Ambrose, Gregory
Nazianzenus, Basil, John of Constantinople.126 Then he argues, that, so far from the catholics
falling into Manichean heresy, Julian plays, himself, into the hands of the Manicheans in
their strife against the catholics, by many unguarded statements, such as, e.g., when he says
that an evil thing cannot arise from what is good, that the work of the Devil cannot be
suffered to be diffused by means of a work of God, that a root of evil cannot be placed
<note type="footnote">124 To wit: Cyprian’s testimony on original sin (20-24), on gratuitous grace (25-26), on the imperfection of

the imperfection of human righteousness (31).</note>

<pb n="76"/>
within a gift of God, and the like. The second book advances to greater detail, and adduces
the five great arguments which the Pelagians urged against the catholics, in order to test
them by the voice of antiquity. These arguments are stated as follows (2): “For you say, ‘That
we, by asserting original sin, affirm that the Devil is the maker of infants, condemn marriage,
deny that all sins are remitted in baptism, accuse God of the guilt of sin, and produce despair
of perfection.’ You contend that all these are consequences, if we believe that infants are
born bound by the sin of the first man, and are therefore under the Devil unless they are
born again in Christ. For, ‘It is the Devil that creates,’ you say, ‘if they are created from that
wound which the Devil inflicted on the human nature that was made at first.’ ‘And marriage
is condemned,’ you say, ‘if it is to be believed to have something about it whence it produces
those worthy of condemnation.’ ‘And all sins are not remitted in baptism,’ you say, ‘if there
remains any evil in baptized couples whence evil offspring are produced.’ ‘And how is God,’
you ask, ‘not unjust, if He, while remitting their own sins to baptized persons, yet condemns
their offspring, inasmuch as, although it is created by Him, it yet ignorantly and involuntarily
contracts the sins of others from those very parents to whom they are remitted?’ ‘Nor can
men believe,’ you add, ‘that virtue—to which corruption is to be understood to be contrary—
can be perfected, if they cannot believe that it can destroy the inbred vices, although,
no doubt, these can scarcely be considered vices, since he does not sin, who is unable to be
other than he was created.’” These arguments are then tested, one by one, by the authority
of the earlier teachers who were appealed to in the first book, and shown to be condemned
by them. The remaining four books follow Julian’s four books, argument by argument, refuting
him in detail. In the third book it is urged that although God is good, and made man
good, and instituted marriage which is, therefore, good, nevertheless concupiscence is evil,
and in it the flesh lusts against the spirit. Although chaste spouses use this evil well, continent
believers do better in not using it at all. It is pointed out, how far all this is from the madness
of the Manicheans, who dream of matter as essentially evil and co-eternal with God; and
shown that evil concupiscence sprang from Adam’s disobedience and, being transmitted
to us, can be removed only by Christ. It is shown, also, that Julian himself confesses lust to
be evil, inasmuch as he speaks of remedies against it, wishes it to be bridled, and speaks of
the continent waging a glorious warfare. The fourth book follows the second book of Julian’s
work, and makes two chief contentions: that unbelievers have no true virtues, and that even
the heathen recognize concupiscence as evil. It also argues that grace is not given according
to merit, and yet is not to be confounded with fate; and explains the text that asserts that
‘God wishes all men to be saved,’ in the sense that ‘all men’ means ‘all that are to be saved’
since none are saved except by His will.127 The fifth book, in like manner, follows Julian’s
third book, and treats of such subjects as these: that it is due to sin that any infants are lost;
<note type="footnote">127 Compare On Rebuke and Grace, 44, and the footnote there.</note>

<pb n="77"/>
that shame arose in our first parents through sin; that sin can well be the punishment of
preceding sin; that concupiscence is always evil, even in those who do not assent to it; that
true marriage may exist without intercourse; that the “flesh” of Christ differs from the
“sinful flesh” of other men; and the like. In the sixth book, Julian’s fourth book is followed,
and original sin is proved from the baptism of infants, the teaching of the apostles, and the
rites of exorcism and exsufflation incorporated in the form of baptism. Then, by the help
of the illustration drawn from the olive and the oleaster, it is explained how Christian parents
can produce unregenerate offspring; and the originally voluntary character of sin is asserted,
even though it now comes by inheritance.</p>
<p>After the completion of this important work, there succeeded a lull in the controversy,
of some years duration; and the calm refutation of Pelagianism and exposition of Christian
grace, which Augustin gave in his Enchiridion,128 might well have seemed to him his closing
word on this all-absorbing subject. But he had not yet given the world all he had in treasure
for it, and we can rejoice in the chance that five or six years afterwards drew from him a
renewed discussion of some of the more important aspects of the doctrine of grace. The
circumstances which brought this about are sufficiently interesting in themselves, and open
up to us an unwonted view into the monastic life of the times. There was an important
monastery at Adrumetum, the metropolitan city of the province of Byzacium,129 from which
a monk named Florus went out on a journey of charity to his native country of Uzalis about
426. On the journey he met with Augustin’s letter to Sixtus,130 in which the doctrines of
gratuitous and prevenient grace were expounded. He was much delighted with it, and,
procuring a copy, sent it back to his monastery for the edification of his brethren, while he
himself went on to Carthage. At the monastery, the letter created great disturbance: without
the knowledge of the abbot, Valentinus, it was read aloud to the monks, many of whom
were unskilled in theological questions; and some five or more were greatly offended, and
declared that free will was destroyed by it. A secret strife arose among the brethren, some
taking extreme grounds on both sides. Of all this, Valentinus remained ignorant until the
return of Florus, who was attacked as the author of all the trouble, and who felt it his duty
to inform the abbot of the state of affairs. Valentinus applied first to the bishop, Evodius,
for such instruction as would make Augustin’s letter clear to the most simple. Evodius
replied, praising their zeal and deprecating their contentiousness, and explaining that Adam
had full free will, but that it is now wounded and weak, and Christ’s mission was as a physician
to cure and recuperate it. “Let them read,” is his prescription, “the words of God’s

understand.” This did not, however, cure the malecontents, and the holy presbyter Sabrinus
was appealed to, and sent a book with clear interpretations. But neither was this satisfactory;
and Valentinus, at last, reluctantly consented that Augustin himself should be consulted,—
fearing, he says, lest by making inquiries he should seem to waver about the truth.
Two members of the community were consequently permitted to journey to Hippo, but
they took with them no introduction and no commendation from their abbot. Augustin,
nevertheless, received them without hesitation, as they bore themselves with too great simplicity
to allow him to suspect them of deception. Now we get a glimpse of life in the great
bishop’s monastic home. The monks told their story, and were listened to with courtesy
and instructed with patience; and, as they were anxious to get home before Easter, they received
a letter for Valentinus131 in which Augustin briefly explains the nature of the misapprehension
that had arisen, and points out that both grace and free will must be defended,
and neither so exaggerated as to deny the other. The letter of Sixtus, he explains, was written
against the Pelagians, who assert that grace is given according to merit, and briefly expounds
the true doctrine of grace as necessarily gratuitous and therefore prevenient. When the
monks were on the point of starting home, they were joined by a third companion from
Adrumetum, and were led to prolong their visit. This gave him the opportunity he craved
for their fuller instruction: he read with them and explained to them not only his letter to
Sixtus, from which the strife had risen, but much of the chief literature of the Pelagian
controversy,132 copies of which also were made for them to take home with them; and when
they were ready to go, he sent by them another and longer letter to Valentinus, and placed
in their hands a treatise composed for their especial use, which, moreover, he explained to
them. This longer letter is essentially an exhortation “to turn aside neither to the right hand
nor to the left,”—neither to the left hand of the Pelagian error of upholding free will in such
a manner as to deny grace, nor to the right hand of the equal error of so upholding grace as
if we might yield ourselves to evil with impunity. Both grace and free will are to be proclaimed;
and it is true both that grace is not given to merits, and that we are to be judged at
the last day according to our works. The treatise which Augustin composed for a fuller exposition
of these doctrines is the important work On Grace and Free Will. After a brief introduction,
explaining the occasion of his writing, and exhorting the monks to humility and
teachableness before God’s revelations (1), Augustin begins by asserting and proving the
two propositions that the Scriptures clearly teach that man has free will (2–5), and, as clearly,
the necessity of grace for doing any good (6–9). He then examines the passages which the
Pelagians claim as teaching that we must first turn to God, before He visits us with His grace
(10–11), and then undertakes to show that grace is not given to merit (12 sq.), appealing
<note type="footnote">131 Epistle 214.</note>
<note type="footnote">132 Epistle 215, 2 sq.</note>

<pb n="79"/>
especially to Paul’s teaching and example, and replying to the assertion that forgiveness is
the only grace that is not given according to our merits (15–18), and to the query, “How
can eternal life be both of grace and of reward?” (19–21). The nature of grace, what it is, is
next explained (22 sq.). It is not the law, which gives only knowledge of sin (22–24), nor
nature, which would render Christ’s death needless (25), nor mere forgiveness of sins, as
the Lord’s Prayer (which should be read with Cyprian’s comments on it) is enough to show
(26). Nor will it do to say that it is given to the merit of a good will, thus distinguishing the
good work which is of grace from the good will which precedes grace (27–30); for the Scrip
tures oppose this, and our prayers for others prove that we expect God to be the first mover,
as indeed both Scripture and experience prove that He is. It is next shown that both free
will and grace are concerned in the heart’s conversion (31–32), and that love is the spring
of all good in man (33–40), which, however, we have only because God first loved us (38),
and which is certainly greater than knowledge, although the Pelagians admit only the latter
to be from God (40). God’s sovereign government of men’s wills is then proved from
Scripture (41–43), and the wholly gratuitous character of grace is illustrated (44), while the
only possible theodicy is found in the certainty that the Lord of all the earth will do right.
For, though no one knows why He takes one and leaves another, we all know that He hardens
judicially and saves graciously,—that He hardens none who do not deserve hardening, but
none that He saves deserve to be saved (45). The treatise closes with an exhortation to its
prayerful and repeated study (46).</p>
<p>The one request that Augustin made, on sending this work to Valentinus, was that
Florus, through whom the controversy had arisen, should be sent to him, that he might
converse with him and learn whether he had been misunderstood, or himself had misunderstood
Augustin. In due time Florus arrived at Hippo, bringing a letter133 from Valentinus
which addresses Augustin as “Lord Pope” (domine papa), thanks him for his “sweet” and
“healing” instruction, and introduces Florus as one whose true faith could be confided in.
It is very clear, both from Valentinus’ letter and from the hints that Augustin gives, that his
loving dealing with the monks had borne admirable fruit: “none were cast down for the
worse, some were built up for the better.”134 But it was reported to him that some one at
the monastery had objected to the doctrine he had taught them, that “no man ought, then,
to be rebuked for not keeping God’s commandments; but only God should be besought that
he might keep them.”135 In other words, it was said that if all good was, in the last resort,
from God’s grace, man ought not to be blamed for not doing what he could not do, but God
ought to be besought to do for man what He alone could do: we ought, in a word, to apply

<pb n="80"/>
to the source of power. This occasioned the composition of yet another treatise On Rebuke
and Grace,136 the object of which was to explain the relations of grace to human conduct,
and especially to make it plain that the sovereignty of God’s grace does not supersede our
duty to ourselves or our fellow-men. It begins by thanking Valentinus for his letter and for
sending Florus (whom Augustin finds well instructed in the truth), thanking God for the
good effect of the previous book, and recommending its continued study, and then by briefly
expounding the Catholic faith concerning grace, free-will, and the law (1–2). The general
proposition that is defended is that the gratuitous sovereignty of God’s grace does not supersede
human means for obtaining and continuing it (3 sq.). This is shown by the apostle’s
example, who used all human means for the prosecution of his work, and yet confessed that
it was “God that gave the increase” (3). Objections are then answered (4 sq.),—especially
the great one that “it is not my fault if I do not do what I have not received grace for doing”
(6); to which Augustin replies (7–10), that we deserve rebuke for our very unwillingness to
be rebuked, that on the same reasoning the prescription of the law and the preaching of the
gospel would be useless, that the apostle’s example opposes such a position, and that our
consciousness witnesses that we deserve rebuke for not persevering in the right way. From
this point an important discussion arises, in this interest, of the gift of perseverance (11–19),
and of God’s election (20–24); the teaching being that no one is saved who does not persevere,
and all that are predestinated or “called according to the purpose” (Augustin’s phrase for
what we should call “effectual calling”) will persevere, and yet that we co-operate by our
will in all good deeds, and deserve rebuke if we do not. Whether Adam received the gift of
perseverance, and, in general, the difference between the grace given to him (which was that
grace by which he could stand) and that now given to God’s children (which is that grace
by which we are actually made to stand), are next discussed (26–38), with the result of
showing the superior greatness of the gifts of grace now to those given before the fall. The
necessity of God’s mercy at all times, and our constant dependence on it, are next vigorously
asserted (39–42); even in the day of judgment, if we are not judged “with mercy” we cannot
be saved (41). The treatise is brought to an end by a concluding application of the whole
discussion to the special matter in hand, rebuke (43–49). Seeing that rebuke is one of God’s
means of working out his gracious purposes, it cannot be inconsistent with the sovereignty
of that grace; for, of course, God predestinates the means with the end (43). Nor can we
know, in our ignorance, whether our rebuke is, in any particular case, to be the means of
amendment or the ground of greater condemnation. How dare we, then, withhold it? Let
it be, however, graduated to the fault, and let us always remember its purpose (46–48). Above
<note type="footnote">136 On the importance of this treatise for Augustin’s doctrine of predestination, see Wiggers’ Augustinianism

<pb n="81"/>
all, let us not dare hold it back, lest we hold back from our brother the means of his recovery,
and, as well, disobey the command of God (49).</p>
<p>It was not long afterwards (about 427) when Augustin was called upon to attempt to
reclaim a Carthaginian brother, Vitalis by name, who had been brought to trial on the charge
of teaching that the beginning of faith was not the gift of God, but the act of man’s own free
will (ex propria voluntatis). This was essentially the semi-Pelagian position which was subsequently
to make so large a figure in history; and Augustin treats it now as necessarily implying
the basal idea of Pelagianism. In the important letter which he sent to Vitalis,137 he
first argues that his position is inconsistent with the prayers of the church. He, Augustin,
prays that Vitalis may come to the true faith; but does not this prayer ascribe the origination
of right faith to God? The Church so prays for all men: the priest at the altar exhorts the
people to pray God for unbelievers, that He may convert them to the faith; for catechumens,
that He may breathe into them a desire for regeneration; for the faithful, that by His aid
they may persevere in what they have begun: will Vitalis refuse to obey these exhortations,
because, forsooth, faith is of free will and not of God’s gift? Nay, will a Carthaginian scholar
array himself against Cyprian’s exposition of the Lord’s Prayer? for he certainly teaches that
we are to ask of God what Vitalis says is to be had of ourselves. We may go farther: it is not
Cyprian, but Paul, who says, “Let us pray to God that we do no evil” (2 Cor. xiii. 7); it is the
Psalmist who says, “The steps of man are directed by God” (Ps. xxxvi. 23). “If we wish to
defend free will, let us not strive against that by which it is made free. For he who strives
against grace, by which the will is made free for refusing evil and doing good, wishes his
will to remain captive. Tell us, I beg you, how the apostle can say, ‘We give thanks to the
Father who made us fit to have our lot with the saints in light, who delivered us from the
power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love’ (Col. i. 12,
13), if not He, but itself, frees our choice? It is, then, a false rendering of thanks to God, as
if He does what He does not do; and he has erred who has said that ‘He makes us fit, etc.’
‘The grace of God,’ therefore, does not consist in the nature of free-will, and in law and
teaching, as the Pelagian perversity dreams; but it is given for each single act by His will,
concerning whom it is written,”—quoting Ps. lxvii. 10. About the middle of the letter, Augustin
lays down twelve propositions against the Pelagians, which are important as communicating
to us what he thought, at the end of the controversy, were the chief points in dispute.
“Since, therefore,” he writes, “we are catholic Christians: 1. We know that new-born children
have not yet done anything in their own lives, good or evil, neither have they come into the
miseries of this life according to the deserts of some previous life, which none of them can
have had in their own persons; and yet, because they are born carnally after Adam, they
contract the contagion of ancient death, by the first birth, and are not freed from the pun-
<note type="footnote">137 Epistle 217.</note>

<pb n="82"/>
ishment of eternal death (which is contracted by a just condemnation, passing over from
one to all), except they are by grace born again in Christ. 2. We know that the grace of God
is given neither to children nor to adults according to our deserts. 3. We know that it is
given to adults for each several act. 4. We know that it is not given to all men; and to those
to whom it is given, it is not only not given according to the merits of works, but it is not
even given to them according to the merits of their will; and this is especially apparent in
children. 5. We know that to those to whom it is given, it is given by the gratuitous mercy
of God. 6. We know that to those to whom it is not given, it is not given by the just judgment
of God. 7. We know that we shall all stand before the tribunal of Christ, and each shall receive
according to what he has done through the body,—not according to what he would have
done, had he lived longer,—whether good or evil. 8. We know that even children are to receive
according to what they have done through the body, whether good or evil. But according
to what “they have done” not by their own act, but by the act of those by whose responses
for them they are said both to renounce the Devil and to believe in God, wherefore they are
counted among the number of the faithful, and have part in the statement of the Lord when
He says, “Whosoever shall believe and be baptized, shall be saved.” Therefore also, to those
who do not receive this sacrament, belongs what follows, “But whosoever shall not have
believed, shall be damned” (Mark xvi. 16). Whence these too, as I have said, if they die in
that early age, are judged, of course, according to what they have done through the body,
i.e., in the time in which they were in the body, when they believe or do not believe by the
heart and mouth of their sponsors, when they are baptized or not baptized, when they eat
or do not eat the flesh of Christ, when they drink or do not drink His blood,—according to
those things, then, which they have done through the body, not according to those which,
had they lived longer, they would have done. 9. We know that blessed are the dead that die
in the Lord; and that what they would have done had they lived longer, is not imputed to
them. 10. We know that those that believe, with their own heart, in the Lord, do so by their
own free will and choice. 11. We know that we who already believe act with right faith towards
those who do not wish to believe, when we pray to God that they may wish it. 12. We know
that for those who have believed out of this number, we both ought and are rightly and truly
accustomed to return thanks to God, as for his benefits.” Certainly such a body of propositions
commends their author to us as Christian both in head and heart: they are admirable
in every respect; and even in the matter of the salvation of infants, where he had not yet
seen the light of truth, he expresses himself in a way as engaging in its hearty faith in God’s
goodness as it is honorable in its loyalty to what he believed to be truth and justice. Here
his doctrine of the Church ran athwart and clouded his view of the reach of grace; but we
seem to see between the lines the promise of the brighter dawn of truth that was yet to come.
The rest of the epistle is occupied with an exposition and commendation of these propositions,
which ranks with the richest passages of the anti-Pelagian writings, and which breathes

<pb n="83"/>
everywhere a yearning for his correspondent which we cannot help hoping proved salutary
to his faith.</p>
<p>It is not without significance, that the error of Vitalis took a semi-Pelagian form. Pure
Pelagianism was by this time no longer a living issue. Augustin was himself, no doubt, not
yet done with it. The second book of his treatise On Marriage and Concupiscence, which
seems to have been taken to Italy by Alypius, in 421, received at once the attention of Julian,
and was elaborately answered by him, during that same year, in eight books addressed to
Florus. But Julian was now in Cilicia, and his book was slow in working its way westward.
It was found at Rome by Alypius, apparently in 427 or 428, and he at once set about transcribing
it for his friend’s use. An opportunity arising to send it to Africa before it was finished,
he forwarded to Augustin the five books that were ready, with an urgent request that
they should receive his immediate attention, and a promise to send the other three as soon
as possible. Augustin gives an account of his progress in his reply to them in a letter written
to Quodvultdeus, apparently in 428.138 This deacon was urging Augustin to give the Church
a succinct account of all heresies; and Augustin excuses himself from immediately undertaking
that task by the press of work on his hands. He was writing his Retractations, and
had already finished two books of them, in which he had dealt with two hundred and thirtytwo
works. His letters and homilies remained and he had given the necessary reading to
many of the letters. Also, he tells his correspondent, he was engaged on a reply to the eight
books of Julian’s new work. Working night and day, he had already completed his response
to the first three of Julian’s books, and had begun on the fourth while still expecting the arrival
of the last three which Alypius had promised to send. If he had completed the answer to the
five books of Julian which he already had in hand, before the other three reached him, he
might begin the work which Quodvultdeus so earnestly desired him to undertake. In due
time, whatever may have been the trials and labours that needed first to be met, the desired
treatise On Heresies was written (about 428), and the eighty-eighth chapter of it gives us a
welcome compressed account of the Pelagian heresy, which may be accepted as the obverse
of the account of catholic truth given in the letter to Vitalis.139 But the composition of this
<note type="footnote">138 Epistle 224.</note>
<note type="footnote">139 The account given of Pelagianism is as follows: “They are in such degree enemies of the grace of God,
by which we have been predestined into the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ unto Himself (Eph. i. 5), and by
which we are delivered from the power of darkness so as to believe in Him, and be translated into His kingdom
(Col. i. 13)—wherefore He says, ‘No man comes to Me, except it be given him of My Father’ (John vi. 66)—and
by which love is shed abroad in our hearts (Rom. v. 5), so that faith may work by love: that they believe that man
is able, without it, to keep all the Divine commandments,—whereas, if this were true, it would clearly be an
empty thing that the Lord said, ‘Without Me ye can do nothing’ (John xv. 5). When Pelagius was at length accused
by the brethren, because he attributed nothing to the assistance of God’s grace towards the keeping of His
commandments, he yielded to their rebuke, so far as not to place this grace above free will, but with faithless</note>

<pb n="84"/>
work was not the only interruption which postponed the completion of the second elaborate
work against Julian. It was in the providence of God that the life of this great leader in the
battle for grace should be prolonged until he could deal with semi-Pelagianism also. Information
as to the rise of this new form of the heresy at Marseilles and elsewhere in Southern
Gaul was conveyed to Augustin along with entreaties, that, as “faith’s great patron,” he
would give his aid towards meeting it, by two laymen with whom he had already had correspondence,—
Prosper and Hilary.140 They pointed out141 the difference between the new
<note type="footnote">cunning to subordinate it, saying that it was given to men for this purpose; viz., that they might be able more
easily to fulfil by grace, what they were commanded to do by free will. By saying, ‘that they might be able more
easily,’ he, of course, wished it to be believed that, although with more difficulty, nevertheless men were able
without divine grace to perform the divine commands. But that grace of God, without which we can do nothing
good, they say does not exist except in free will, which without any preceding merits our nature received from
Him; and that He adds His aid only in that by His law and teaching we may learn what we ought to do, but not
in that by the gift of His Spirit we may do what we have learned ought to be done. Accordingly, they confess
that knowledge by which ignorance is banished is divinely given to us, but deny that love by which we may live
a pious life is given; so that, forsooth, while knowledge, which, without love, puffeth up, is the gift of God, love
itself, which edifieth so that knowledge may not puff up, is not the gift of God (1 Cor. viii. 11). They also destroy
the prayers which the Church offers, whether for those that are unbelieving and resisting God’s teaching, that
they may be converted to God; or for the faithful, that faith may be increased in them, and they may persevere
in it. For they contend that men do not receive these things from Him, but have them from ourselves, saying,
that the grace of God, by which we are freed from impiety, is given according to our merits. Pelagius was compelled,
no doubt, to condemn this by his fear of being condemned by the episcopal judgment in Palestine; but
he is found to teach it still in his later writings. They also advanced so far as to say that the life of the righteous
in this world is without sin, and the Church of Christ is perfected by them in this mortality, to the point of being
entirely without spot or wrinkle (Eph. v. 27); as if it were not the Church of Christ, that, in the whole world,
cries to God, ‘Forgive us our debts.’ They also deny that children, who are carnally born after Adam, contract
the contagion of ancient death from their first birth. For they assert that they are born so without any bond of
original sin, that there is absolutely nothing that ought to be remitted to them in the second birth, yet they are
to be baptized; but for this reason, that, adopted in regeneration, they may be admitted to the kingdom of God,
and thus be translated from good into better,—not that they may be washed by that renovation from any evil
of the old bond. For although they be not baptized, they promise to them, outside the kingdom of God indeed,
but nevertheless, a certain eternal and blessed life of their own. They also say that Adam himself, even had he
not sinned, would have died in the body, and that this death would not have come as a desert to a fault, but as
a condition of nature. Certain other things also are objected to them, but these are the chief, and also either all,
or nearly all, the others may be understood to depend on these.”</note>

party and thorough-going Pelagianism; but, at the same time, the essentially Pelagianizing
character of its formative elements. Its representatives were ready, as a rule, to admit that
all men were lost in Adam, and no one could recover himself by his own free will, but all
needed God’s grace for salvation. But they objected to the doctrines of prevenient and of
irresistible grace; and asserted that man could initiate the process of salvation by turning
first to God, that all men could resist God’s grace, and no grace could be given which they
could not reject, and especially they denied that the gifts of grace came irrespective of merits,
actual or foreseen. They said that what Augustin taught as to the calling of God’s elect according
to His own purpose was tantamount to fatalism, was contrary to the teaching of
the fathers and the true Church doctrine, and, even if true, should not be preached, because
of its tendency to drive men into indifference or despair. Hence, Prosper especially desired
Augustin to point out the dangerous nature of these views, and to show that prevenient and
co-operating grace is not inconsistent with free will, that God’s predestination is not founded
on foresight of receptivity in its objects, and that the doctrines of grace may be preached
without danger to souls.</p>
<p>Augustin’s answer to these appeals was a work in two books, On the Predestination of
the Saints, the second book of which is usually known under the separate title of The Gift
of Perseverance. The former book begins with a careful discrimination of the position of his
new opponents: they have made a right beginning in that they believe in original sin, and
acknowledge that none are saved from it save by Christ, and that God’s grace leads men’s
wills, and without grace no one can suffice for good deeds. These things will furnish a good
starting-point for their progress to an acceptance of predestination also (1–2). The first
question that needs discussion in such circumstances is, whether God gives the very beginnings
of faith (3 sq.); since they admit that what Augustin had previously urged sufficed to
prove that faith was the gift of God so far as that the increase of faith was given by Him, but
not so far but that the beginning of faith may be understood to be man’s, to which, then,
God adds all other gifts (compare 43). Augustin insists that this is no other than the Pelagian
assertion of grace according to merit (3), is opposed to Scripture (4–5), and begets arrogant
boasting in ourselves (6). He replies to the objection that he had himself once held this view,
by confessing it, and explaining that he was converted from it by 1 Cor. iv. 7, as applied by
Cyprian (7–8), and expounds that verse as containing in its narrow compass a sufficient
answer to the present theories (9–11). He answers, further, the objection that the apostle
distinguishes faith from works, and works alone are meant in such passages, by pointing to
John vi. 28, and similar statements in Paul (12–16). Then he answers the objection that he
himself had previously taught that God acted on foresight of faith, by showing that he was
misunderstood (17–18). He next shows that no objection lies against predestination that
does not lie with equal force against grace (19–22),—since predestination is nothing but
God’s foreknowledge of and preparation for grace, and all questions of sovereignty and the

<pb n="86"/>
like belong to grace. Did God not know to whom he was going to give faith (19)? or did he
promise the results of faith, works, without promising the faith without which, as going
before, the works were impossible? Would not this place God’s fulfilment of his promise
out of His power, and make it depend on man (20)? Why are men more willing to trust in
their weakness than in God’s strength? do they count God’s promises more uncertain than
their own performance (22)? He next proves the sovereignty of grace, and of predestination,
which is but the preparation for grace, by the striking examples of infants, and, above all,
of the human nature of Christ (23–31), and then speaks of the twofold calling, one external
and one “according to purpose,”—the latter of which is efficacious and sovereign (32–37).
In closing, the semi-Pelagian position is carefully defined and refuted as opposed, alike with
the grosser Pelagianism, to the Scriptures of both Testaments (38–42).</p>
<p>The purpose of the second book, which has come down to us under the separate title
of On the Gift of Perseverance, is to show that that perseverance which endures to the end
is as much of God as the beginning of faith, and that no man who has been “called according
to God’s purpose,” and has received this gift, can fall from grace and be lost. The first half
of the treatise is devoted to this theme (1–33). It begins by distinguishing between temporary
perseverance, which endures for a time, and that which continues to the end (1), and affirms
that the latter is certainly a gift of God’s grace, and is, therefore, asked from God which
would otherwise be but a mocking petition (2–3). This, the Lord’s Prayer itself might teach
us, as under Cyprian’s exposition it does teach us,—each petition being capable of being
read as a prayer for perseverance (4–9). Of course, moreover, it cannot be lost, otherwise it
would not be “to the end.” If man forsakes God, of course it is he that does it, and he is
doubtless under continual temptation to do so; but if he abides with God, it is God who secures
that, and God is equally able to keep one when drawn to Him, as He is to draw him
to Him (10–15). He argues anew at this point, that grace is not according to merit, but always
in mercy; and explains and illustrates the unsearchable ways of God in His sovereign but
merciful dealing with men (16–25), and closes this part of the treatise by a defence of himself
against adverse quotations from his early work on Free Will, which he has already corrected
in his Retractations. The second half of the book discusses the objections that were being
urged against the preaching of predestination (34–62), as if it opposed and enervated the
preaching of the Gospel. He replies that Paul and the apostles, and Cyprian and the fathers,
preached both together; that the same objections will lie against the preaching of God’s
foreknowledge and grace itself, and, indeed, against preaching any of the virtues, as, e.g.,
obedience, while declaring them God’s gifts. He meets the objections in detail, and shows
that such preaching is food to the soul, and must not be withheld from men; but explains
that it must be given gently, wisely, and prayerfully. The whole treatise ends with an appeal
to the prayers of the Church as testifying that all good is from God (63–65), and to the great
example of unmerited grace and sovereign predestination in the choice of one human nature

<pb n="87"/>
without preceding merit, to be united in one person with the Eternal Word,—an illustration
of his theme of the gratuitous grace of God which he is never tired of adducing (66–67).</p>
<p>These books were written in 428–429, and after their completion the unfinished work
against Julian was resumed. Alypius had sent the remaining three books, and Augustin
slowly toiled on to the end of his reply to the sixth book. But he was to be interrupted once
more, and this time by the most serious of all interruptions. On the 28th of August, 430,
with the Vandals thundering at the gates of Hippo, full of good works and of faith, he turned
his face away from the strifes—whether theological or secular—of earth, and entered into
rest with the Lord whom he loved. The last work against Julian was already one of the most
considerable in size of all his books; but it was never finished, and retains until to-day the
significant title of The Unfinished Work. Augustin had hesitated to undertake this work,
because he found Julian’s arguments too silly either to deserve refutation, or to afford occasion
for really edifying discourse. And certainly the result falls below Augustin’s usual level,
though this is not due, as is so often said, to failing powers and great age; for nothing that
he wrote surpasses in mellow beauty and chastened strength the two books, On the Predestination
of the Saints, which were written after four books of this work were completed. The
plan of the work is to state Julian’s arguments in his own words, and follow it with his remarks;
thus giving it something of the form of a dialogue. It follows Julian’s work, book by
book. The first book states and answers certain calumnies which Julian had brought against
Augustin and the catholic faith on the ground of their confession of original sin. Julian had
argued, that, since God is just, He cannot impute another’s sins to innocent infants; since
sin is nothing but evil will, there can be no sin in infants who are not yet in the use of their
will; and, since the freedom of will that is given to man consists in the capacity of both sinning
and not sinning, free will is denied to those who attribute sin to nature. Augustin replies to
these arguments, and answers certain objections that are made to his work On Marriage
and Concupiscence, and then corrects Julian’s false explanations of certain Scriptures from
John viii., Rom. vi., vii., and 2 Timothy. The second book is a discussion of Rom. v. 12,
which Julian had tried, like the other Pelagians, to explain by the “imitation” of Adam’s bad
example. The third book examines the abuse by Julian of certain Old-Testament passages—in
Deut. xxiv., 2 Kings xiv., Ezek. xviii.—in his effort to show that God does not impute the
father’s sins to the children; as well as his similar abuse of Heb. xi. The charge of Manicheism,
which was so repetitiously brought by Julian against the catholics, is then examined and
refuted. The fourth book treats of Julian’s strictures on Augustin’s On Marriage and Conculxvi
piscence ii. 4–11, and proves from 1 John ii. 16 that concupiscence is evil, and not the work
of God, but of the Devil. He argues that the shame that accompanies it is due to its sinfulness,
and that there was none of it in Christ; also, that infants are born obnoxious to the first sin,
and proves the corruption of their origin from Wisd. x. 10, 11. The fifth book defends On
Marriage and Concupiscence ii. 12 sq., and argues that a sound nature could not have shame

<pb n="88"/>
on account of its members, and the need of regeneration for what is generated by means of
shameful concupiscence. Then Julian’s abuse of 1 Cor. xv., Rom. v., Matt. vii. 17 and 33,
with reference to On Marriage and Concupiscence ii. 14, 20, 26, is discussed; and then the
origin of evil, and God’s treatment of evil in the world. The sixth book traverses Julian’s
strictures on On Marriage and Concupiscence ii. 34 sq., and argues that human nature was
changed for the worse by the sin of Adam, and thus was made not only sinful, but the source
of sinners; and that the forces of free will by which man could at first do rightly if he wished,
and refrain from sin if he chose, were lost by Adam’s sin. He attacks Julian’s definition of
free will as “the capacity for sinning and not sinning” (possibilitas peccandi et non peccandi);
and proves that the evils of this life are the punishment of sin,—including, first of all, physical
death. At the end, he treats of 1 Cor. xv. 22.</p>
<p>Although the great preacher of grace was taken away by death before the completion
of this book, yet his work was not left incomplete. In the course of the next year (431) the
Ecumenical Council of Ephesus condemned Pelagianism for the whole world; and an elaborate
treatise against the pure Pelagianism of Julian was already in 430 an anachronism.
Semi-Pelagianism was yet to run its course, and to work its way so into the heart of a corrupt
church as not to be easily displaced; but Pelagianism was to die with the first generation of
its advocates. As we look back now through the almost millennium and a half of years that
has intervened since Augustin lived and wrote, it is to his Predestination of the Saints,—a
completed, and well-completed, treatise,—and not to The Unfinished Work, that we look
as the crown and completion of his labours for grace.</p>

<head>IV. The Theology of Grace.</head>
<p>The theology which Augustin opposed, in his anti-Pelagian writings, to the errors of
Pelagianism, is, shortly, the theology of grace. Its roots were planted deeply in his own experience,
and in the teachings of Scripture, especially of that apostle whom he delights to
call “the great preacher of grace,” and to follow whom, in his measure, was his greatest desire.
The grace of God in Jesus Christ, conveyed to us by the Holy Spirit and evidenced by the
love that He sheds abroad in our hearts, is the centre around which this whole side142 of
His system revolves, and the germ out of which it grows. He was the more able to make it
thus central because of the harmony of this view of salvation with the general principle of
his whole theology, which was theocentric and revolved around his conception of God as
the immanent and vital spirit in whom all things live and move and have their being.143 In
like manner, God is the absolute good, and all good is either Himself or from Him; and only
as God makes us good, are we able to do anything good.</p>
<p>The necessity of grace to man, Augustin argued from the condition of the race as partakers
of Adam’s sin. God created man upright, and endowed him with human faculties, including
free will;144 and gave to him freely that grace by which he was able to retain his uprightness.
145 Being thus put on probation,146 with divine aid to enable him to stand if he chose,
<note type="footnote">142 This is a necessary limitation, for there is another side—a churchly side—of Augustin’s theology, which
was only laid alongside of, and artificially combined with, his theology of grace. This was the traditional element
in his teaching, but was far from the determining or formative element. As Thomasius truly points out (Dogmengeschichte,
i. 495), both his experience and the Scriptures stood with him above tradition.</note>
<note type="footnote">143 It is only one of the strange assertions in Professor Allen’s Continuity of Christian Thought, that he makes
“the Augustinian theology rest upon the transcendence of Deity as its controlling principle” (p. 3), which is
identified with “a tacit assumption of deism” (p. 171), and explained to include a “localization of God as a
physical essence in the infinite remoteness,” “separated from the world by infinite reaches of space.” As a matter
of mere fact, Augustin’s conception of God was that of an immanent Spirit, and his tendency was consequently
distinctly towards a pantheistic rather than a deistic view of His relation to His creatures. Nor is this true only
“at a certain stage of his career” (p. 6), which is but Professor Allen’s attempt to reconcile fact with his theory,
but of his whole life and all his teaching. He, no doubt, did not so teach the Divine immanence as to make God
the author of the form as well as the matter of all acts of His creatures, or to render it impossible for His creatures
to turn from Him; this would be to pass the limits that separate the conception of Christian immanence from
pure pantheism, and to make God the author of sin, and all His creatures but manifestations of Himself.</note>

Adam used his free choice for sinning, and involved his whole race in his fall.147 It was on
account of this sin that he died physically and spiritually, and this double death passes over
from him to us.148 That all his descendants by ordinary generation are partakers in Adam’s
guilt and condemnation, Augustin is sure from the teachings of Scripture; and this is the
fact of original sin, from which no one generated from Adam is free, and from which no
one is freed save as regenerated in Christ.149 But how we are made partakers of it, he is less
certain: sometimes he speaks as if it came by some mysterious unity of the race, so that we
were all personally present in the individual Adam, and thus the whole race was the one
man that sinned;150 sometimes he speaks more in the sense of modern realists, as if Adam’s
sin corrupted the nature, and the nature now corrupts those to whom it is communicated;151
sometimes he speaks as if it were due to simple heredity;152 sometimes, again, as if it depended
on the presence of shameful concupiscence in the act of procreation, so that the
propagation of guilt depends on the propagation of offspring by means of concupiscence.153
However transmitted, it is yet a fact that sin is propagated, and all mankind became sinners
in Adam. The result of this is that we have lost the divine image, though not in such a sense
that no lineaments of it remain to us;154 and, the sinning soul making the flesh corruptible,
our whole nature is corrupted, and we are unable to do anything of ourselves truly good.155
This includes, of course, an injury to our will. Augustin, writing for the popular eye, treats
this subject in popular language. But it is clear that he distinguished, in his thinking, between
will as a faculty and will in a broader sense. As a mere faculty, will is and always remains an
indifferent thing,156—after the fall, as before it, continuing poised in indifferency, and ready,
like a weathercock, to be turned whithersoever the breeze that blows from the heart (“will,”
in the broader sense) may direct.157 It is not the faculty of willing, but the man who makes
use of that faculty, that has suffered change from the fall. In paradise man stood in full
ability: he had the posse non peccare, but not yet the non posse peccare;158 that is, he was

endowed with a capacity for either part, and possessed the grace of God by which he was
able to stand if he would, but also the power of free will by which he might fall if he would.
By his fall he has suffered a change, is corrupt, and under the power of Satan; his will (in
the broader sense) is now injured, wounded, diseased, enslaved,—although the faculty of
will (in the narrow sense) remains indifferent.159 Augustin’s criticism of Pelagius’ discrimination160
of “capacity” (possibilitas, posse), “will” (voluntas, velle), and “act” (actio, esse),
does not turn on the discrimination itself, but on the incongruity of placing the power,
ability in the mere capacity or possibility, rather than in the living agent who “wills” and
“acts.” He himself adopts an essentially similar distribution, with only this correction;161
and thus keeps the faculty of will indifferent, but places the power of using it in the active
agent, man. According, then, to the character of this man, will the use of the free will be. If
the man be holy he will make a holy use of it, and if he be corrupt he will make a sinful use
of it: if he be essentially holy, he cannot (like God Himself) make a sinful use of his will; and
if he be enslaved to sin, he cannot make a good use of it. The last is the present condition
of men by nature. They have free will;162 the faculty by which they act remains in indifferency,
and they are allowed to use it just as they choose: but such as they cannot desire and therefore
cannot choose anything but evil;163 and therefore they, and therefore their choice, and
therefore their willing, is always evil and never good. They are thus the slaves of sin, which
they obey; and while their free will avails for sinning, it does not avail for doing any good
unless they be first freed by the grace of God. It is undeniable that this view is in consonance
with modern psychology: let us once conceive of “the will” as simply the whole man in the
attitude of willing, and it is immediately evident, that, however abstractly free the “will” is,
it is conditioned and enslaved in all its action by the character of the willing agent: a bad
man does not cease to be bad in the act of willing, and a good man remains good even in
his acts of choice.</p>
<p>In its nature, grace is assistance, help from God; and all divine aid may be included under
the term,—as well what may be called natural, as what may be called spiritual, aid.164 Spiritual
grace includes, no doubt, all external help that God gives man for working out his salvation,
such as the law, the preaching of the gospel, the example of Christ, by which we may
learn the right way; it includes also forgiveness of sins, by which we are freed from the guilt
already incurred; but above all it includes that help which God gives by His Holy Spirit,

<pb n="92"/>
working within, not without, by which man is enabled to choose and to do what he sees, by
the teachings of the law, or by the gospel, or by the natural conscience, to be right.165
Within this aid are included all those spiritual exercises which we call regeneration, justification,
perseverance to the end,—in a word, all the divine assistance by which, in being made
Christians, we are made to differ from other men. Augustin is fond of representing this
grace as in essence the writing of God’s law (or of God’s will) on our hearts, so that it appears
hereafter as our own desire and wish; and even more prevalently as the shedding abroad of
love in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, given to us in Christ Jesus; therefore, as a change of
disposition, by which we come to love and freely choose, in co-operation with God’s aid,
just the things which hitherto we have been unable to choose because in bondage to sin.
Grace, thus, does not make void free will:166 it acts through free will, and acts upon it only
by liberating it from its bondage to sin, i.e., by liberating the agent that uses the free will, so
that he is no longer enslaved by his fleshly lusts, and is enabled to make use of his free will
in choosing the good; and thus it is only by grace that free will is enabled to act in good part.
But just because grace changes the disposition, and so enables man, hitherto enslaved to
sin, for the first time to desire and use his free will for good, it lies in the very nature of the
case that it is prevenient.167 Also, as the very name imports, it is necessarily gratuitous;168
since man is enslaved to sin until it is given, all the merits that he can have prior to it are
bad merits, and deserve punishment, not gifts of favour. When, then, it is asked, on the
ground of what, grace is given, it can only be answered, “on the ground of God’s infinite
mercy and undeserved favour.”169 There is nothing in man to merit it, and it first gives
merit of good to man. All men alike deserve death, and all that comes to them in the way
of blessing is necessarily of God’s free and unmerited favour. This is equally true of all grace.
It is pre-eminently clear of that grace which gives faith, the root of all other graces, which
is given of God, not to merits of good-will or incipient turning to Him, but of His sovereign
good pleasure.170 But equally with faith, it is true of all other divine gifts: we may, indeed,
speak of “merits of good” as succeeding faith; but as all these merits find their root in faith,
they are but “grace on grace,” and men need God’s mercy always, throughout this life, and
even on the judgment day itself, when, if they are judged without mercy, they must be condemned.
171 If we ask, then, why God gives grace, we can only answer that it is of His un-

speakable mercy; and if we ask why He gives it to one rather than to another, what can we
answer but that it is of His will? The sovereignty of grace results from its very gratuitousness:
172 where none deserve it, it can be given only of the sovereign good pleasure of the
great Giver,—and this is necessarily inscrutable, but cannot be unjust. We can faintly perceive,
indeed, some reasons why God may be supposed not to have chosen to give His saving grace
to all,173 or even to the most;174 but we cannot understand why He has chosen to give it to
just the individuals to whom He has given it, and to withhold it from just those from whom
He has withheld it. Here we are driven to the apostle’s cry, “Oh the depth of the riches both
of the mercy and the justice of God!”175</p>
<p>The effects of grace are according to its nature. Taken as a whole, it is the recreative
principle sent forth from God for the recovery of man from his slavery to sin, and for his
reformation in the divine image. Considered as to the time of its giving, it is either operating
or co-operating grace, i.e., either the grace that first enables the will to choose the good, or
the grace that co-operates with the already enabled will to do the good; and it is, therefore,
also called either prevenient or subsequent grace.176 It is not to be conceived of as a series
of disconnected divine gifts, but as a constant efflux from God; but we may look upon it in
the various steps of its operation in men, as bringing forgiveness of sins, faith, which is the
beginning of all good, love to God, progressive power of good working, and perseverance
to the end.177 In any case, and in all its operations alike, just because it is power from on
high and the living spring of a new and re-created life, it is irresistible and indefectible.178
Those on whom the Lord bestows the gift of faith working from within, not from without,
of course, have faith, and cannot help believing. Those to whom perseverance to the end is
given must persevere to the end. It is not to be objected to this, that many seem to begin
well who do not persevere: this also is of God, who has in such cases given great blessings
indeed, but not this blessing, of perseverance to the end. Whatever of good men have, that
God has given; and what they have not, why, of course, God has not given it. Nor can it be
objected, that this leaves all uncertain: it is only unknown to us, but this is not uncertainty;
we cannot know that we are to have any gift which God sovereignly gives, of course, until
it is given, and we therefore cannot know that we have perseverance unto the end until we
actually persevere to the end;179 but who would call what God does, and knows He is to do,

uncertain, and what man is to do certain? Nor will it do to say that thus nothing is left for
us to do: no doubt, all things are in God’s hands, and we should praise God that this is so,
but we must co-operate with Him; and it is just because it is He that is working in us the
willing and the doing, that it is worth our while to work out our salvation with fear and
trembling. God has not determined the end without determining the appointed means.180</p>
<p>Now, Augustin argues, since grace certainly is gratuitous, and given to no preceding
merits,—prevenient and antecedent to all good,—and, therefore, sovereign, and bestowed
only on those whom God selects for its reception; we must, of course, believe that the
eternal God has foreknown all this from the beginning. He would be something less than
God, had He not foreknown that He intended to bestow this prevenient, gratuitous, and
sovereign grace on some men, and had He not foreknown equally the precise individuals
on whom He intended to bestow it. To foreknow is to prepare beforehand. And this is
predestination.181 He argues that there can be no objection to predestination, in itself considered,
in the mind of any man who believes in a God: what men object to is the gratuitous
and sovereign grace to which no additional difficulty is added by the necessary assumption
that it was foreknown and prepared for from eternity. That predestination does not proceed
on the foreknowledge of good or of faith,182 follows from its being nothing more than the
foresight and preparation of grace, which, in its very idea, is gratuitous and not according
to any merits, sovereign and according only to God’s purpose, prevenient and in order to
faith and good works. It is the sovereignty of grace, not its foresight or the preparation for
it, which places men in God’s hands, and suspends salvation absolutely on his unmerited
mercy. But just because God is God, of course, no one receives grace who has not been
foreknown and afore-selected for the gift; and, as much of course, no one who has been
foreknown and afore-selected for it, fails to receive it. Therefore the number of the predestinated
is fixed, and fixed by God.183 Is this fate? Men may call God’s grace fate if they
choose; but it is not fate, but undeserved love and tender mercy, without which none would
be saved.184 Does it paralyze effort? Only to those who will not strive to obey God because
obedience is His gift. Is it unjust? Far from it: shall not God do what He will with His own
undeserved favour? It is nothing but gratuitous mercy, sovereignly distributed, and foreseen
and provided for from all eternity by Him who has selected us in His Son.</p>
<p>When Augustin comes to speak of the means of grace, i.e., of the channels and circumstances
of its conference to men, he approaches the meeting point of two very dissimilar

<pb n="95"/>
streams of his theology,—his doctrine of grace and his doctrine of the Church,—and he is
sadly deflected from the natural course of his theology by the alien influence. He does not,
indeed, bind the conference of grace to the means in such a sense that the grace must be
given at the exact time of the application of the means. He does not deny that “God is able,
even when no man rebukes, to correct whom He will, and to lead him on to the wholesome
mortification of repentance by the most hidden and most mighty power of His medicine.”185
Though the Gospel must be known in order that man may be saved186 (for how shall they
believe without a preacher?), yet the preacher is nothing, and the preachment is nothing,
but God only that gives the increase.187 He even has something like a distant glimpse of
what has since been called the distinction between the visible and invisible
Church,—speaking of men not yet born as among those who are “called according to God’s
purpose,” and, therefore, of the saved who constitute the Church,188—asserting that those
who are so called, even before they believe, are “already children of God enrolled in the
memorial of their Father with unchangeable surety,”189 and, at the same time, allowing that
there are many already in the visible Church who are not of it, and who can therefore depart
from it. But he teaches that those who are thus lost out of the visible Church are lost because
of some fatal flaw in their baptism, or on account of post-baptismal sins; and that those who
are of the “called according to the purpose” are predestinated not only to salvation, but to
salvation by baptism. Grace is not tied to the means in the sense that it is not conferred save
in the means; but it is tied to the means in the sense that it is not conferred without the
means. Baptism, for instance, is absolutely necessary for salvation: no exception is allowed
except such as save the principle,—baptism of blood (martyrdom),190 and, somewhat
grudgingly, baptism of intention. And baptism, when worthily received, is absolutely efficacious:
“if a man were to die immediately after baptism, he would have nothing at all left to
hold him liable to punishment.”191 In a word, while there are many baptized who will not
be saved, there are none saved who have not been baptized; it is the grace of God that saves,
but baptism is a channel of grace without which none receive it.192</p>

<pb n="96"/>
<p>The saddest corollary that flowed from this doctrine was that by which Augustin was
forced to assert that all those who died unbaptized, including infants, are finally lost and
depart into eternal punishment. He did not shrink from the inference, although he assigned
the place of lightest punishment in hell to those who were guilty of no sin but original sin,
but who had departed this life without having washed this away in the “laver of regeneration.”
This is the dark side of his soteriology; but it should be remembered that it was not his
theology of grace, but the universal and traditional belief in the necessity of baptism for remission
of sins, which he inherited in common with all of his time, that forced it upon him.
The theology of grace was destined in the hands of his successors, who have rejoiced to
confess that they were taught by him, to remove this stumbling-block also from Christian
teaching; and if not to Augustin, it is to Augustin’s theology that the Christian world owes
its liberation from so terrible and incredible a tenet. Along with the doctrine of infant
damnation, another stumbling-block also, not so much of Augustinian, but of Church
theology, has gone. It was not because of his theology of grace, or of his doctrine of predestination,
that Augustin taught that comparatively few of the human race are saved. It was,
again, because he believed that baptism and incorporation into the visible Church were
necessary for salvation. And it is only because of Augustin’s theology of grace, which places
man in the hands of an all-merciful Saviour and not in the grasp of a human institution,
that men can see that in the salvation of all who die in infancy, the invisible Church of God
embraces the vast majority of the human race,—saved not by the washing of water administered
by the Church, but by the blood of Christ administered by God’s own hand outside
of the ordinary channels of his grace. We are indeed born in sin, and those that die in infancy
are, in Adam, children of wrath even as others; but God’s hand is not shortened by the
limits of His Church on earth, that it cannot save. In Christ Jesus, all souls are the Lord’s,
and only the soul that itself sinneth shall die (Ezek. xviii. 1–4); and the only judgment
wherewith men shall be judged proceeds on the principle that as many as have sinned
without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under law shall be
judged by the law (Rev. ii. 12).</p>
<p>Thus, although Augustin’s theology had a very strong churchly element within it, it was,
on the side that is presented in the controversy against Pelagianism, distinctly anti-ecclesiastical.
Its central thought was the absolute dependence of the individual on the grace of
God in Jesus Christ. It made everything that concerned salvation to be of God, and traced
the source of all good to Him. “Without me ye can do nothing,” is the inscription on one
side of it; on the other stands written, “All things are yours.” Augustin held that he who
builds on a human foundation builds on sand, and founded all his hope on the Rock itself.
And there also he founded his teaching; as he distrusted man in the matter of salvation, so
he distrusted him in the form of theology. No other of the fathers so conscientiously wrought
out his theology from the revealed Word; no other of them so sternly excluded human ad-

<pb n="97"/>
ditions. The subjects of which theology treats, he declares, are such as “we could by no means
find out unless we believed them on the testimony of Holy Scripture.”193 “Where Scripture
gives no certain testimony,” he says, “human presumption must beware how it decides in
favor of either side.”194 “We must first bend our necks to the authority of Scripture,” he
insists, “in order that we may arrive at knowledge and understanding through faith.”195
And this was not merely his theory, but his practice.196 No theology was ever, it may be
more broadly asserted, more conscientiously wrought out from the Scriptures. Is it without
error? No; but its errors are on the surface, not of the essence. It leads to God, and it came
from God; and in the midst of the controversies of so many ages it has shown itself an edifice
whose solid core is built out of material “which cannot be shaken.”197</p>

<head>Dedication of Volume I. Of the Edinburgh Edition.</head>
<p>TO THE RIGHT REVEREND THE LORD BISHOP OF EXETER.</p>
<p>My Dear Lord,—I gladly avail myself of your permission to dedicate this volume to you.
In the course of a professional life of nearly the third of a century, which has not been idly
spent, I have never failed to find pleasure in theological pursuits. In the intervals of most
pressing labour, these have often tended to refresh and comfort one’s wearied spirit. If this
confession of my own experience should have any weight with any one in our sacred calling
to combine the hard work which we owe to others while ministering to their wants, with
“that diligent attendance to reading” which we require for ourselves, to inform our minds
and refresh our spirits, I shall have accomplished my only purpose in making it. Your
Lordship, I am sure, will entirely approve of such a combination of employments in your
clergy. I well remember your recommendation of theological study to us at the opening of
Bishop Phillpott’s Library at Truro; and how you counselled us the more earnestly to pursue
it, from the danger there is, in these busy times, of merging the acquisition of sacred learning
in the active labours of our holy vocation. That the divine blessing may crown the work
which you are so diligently prosecuting in the several functions of your high office, is the
earnest wish, my dear Lord, of your faithful servant,</p>

<head>Dedication of Volume II. Of the Edinburgh Edition.</head>
<p>TO THE REV. C. T. WILKINSON, M.A.,
VICAR OF ST. ANDREWS WITH PENNYCROSS, PLYMOUTH.</p>
<p>My Dear Vicar,—I have great pleasure in associating your name with my own in this
volume. We are officially connected in the sacred ministry of the Church, and I think I may,
not unsuitably, extend our relations in this little effort to strengthen the defences of the great
doctrine of Grace committed to our care and advocacy. Never was this portion of revealed
truth more formidably assailed than at the present day. Rationalism, as its primary dogma,
asserts the perfectibility of our nature, out of its own resources; and with a versatility and
power of argument and illustration, which gathers help from every quarter in literature and
philosophy, it opposes “the truth as it is in Jesus.” This truth, which implies, as its cardinal
points, the ruin of man’s nature in the sin of the first Adam, and its recovery in the obedience
of the second Adam, is vindicated with admirable method and convincing force in the Anti-
Pelagian treatises of the great Doctor of the Western Church. Some of these treatises appear
for the first time in our language in this volume; and you will, I am sure, admire the acuteness
with which Saint Augustin tracks out and refutes the sophistries of the rationalists of his
own day, as well as the profound knowledge and earnest charity with which he enforces and
recommends the Catholic verity.</p>
<p>In identifying you thus far with myself in this undertaking, I not only gratify my own
feelings of sincere friendship, but with a confidence which I believe I do not over-estimate,
I assume, what I highly prize, your agreement with me in accepting and furthering the
principles set forth in this volume.</p>
<p>With sincere sympathy for you in your important work at Plymouth, and best wishes
for the divine blessing upon it, believe me, yours very faithfully,</p>

<p>§ 1. The reader has in this volume, translated for the first time in English, five of the
fifteen treatises of St. Augustin on the Pelagian heresy. They are here arranged in the same
order (the chronological one) in which they are placed in the tenth volume of the Benedictine
edition, and are therefore St. Augustin’s earliest contributions to the great controversy.
These are their Latin titles:</p>
<p>De peccatorum meritis et remissione, et de baptismo parvulorum ad Marcellinum; libri
tres, scripti anno Christi 412.</p>
<p>De Spiritu et littera ad eumdem; liber unus, scriptus sub finem anni 412.</p>
<p>De natura et gratia contra Pelagium, ad Timasium et Jacobum; liber unus, scriptus anno
Christi 415.</p>
<p>De perfectione justitiæ hominis; <del>Epistola seu</del> liber ad Eutropium et Paulum, scriptus
circiter finem anni 415.</p>
<p>De gestis Pelagii ad Aurelium episcopum; liber unus, scriptus sub initium anni 417.</p>
<p>The Benedictine editors have enriched their edition with prefaces (“Admonitiones”)
and critical and explanatory notes, and, above all, with the appropriate extracts from St.
Augustin’s Retractations,198 in which we have the author’s own final revision and correction
<note type="footnote">198 It is satisfactory to observe how brief and scanty are his “retractations” on the topics treated in the present
volume.</note>

<pb n="101"/>
of his works. All these have been reproduced in a translated form in this volume; and they
will, it is believed, afford the reader sufficient guidance for an intelligent apprehension of
at least the special arguments of the several treatises. The Benedictine editors, however,
prefixed to this detailed information an elaborate and lengthy preface, in which they reviewed
the general history of the Pelagian discussions and their authors, with especial reference to
the part which St. Augustin played throughout it. This historical introduction it was at first
intended to present to the reader in English at the head of this volume. In consideration,
however, of the length of the document, we have so far changed our purpose as to substitute
a shorter statement of certain facts and features of the Pelagian controversy, which it is
hoped may contribute to a better understanding of the general subject.</p>
<p>§ 2. The Pelagian heresy is so designated after Pelagius, a British monk. (Augustin calls
him Brito, so do Prosper and Gennadius; by Orosius he is called Britannicus noster, and by
Mercator described as gente Britannus. This wide epithet is somewhat restricted by Jerome,
who says of him, Habet progeniem Scotiæ gentis de Britannorum vicinia; leaving it uncertain,
however, whether he deemed Scotland his native country, or Ireland. His monastic character
is often referred to both by Augustin and other writers, and Pope Zosimus describes him
as Laicum virum ad bonam frugem longa erga Deum servitute nitentem. It is, after all, quite
uncertain what part of “Britain” gave him birth; among other conjectures, he has been made
a native of Wales, attached to a monastery at Bangor, and gifted with the Welsh name of
Morgan, of which his usual designation of Pelagius is supposed to be simply the Greek version,
Πελαγιος.) It was at the beginning of the fifth century that he became conspicuous. He then
resided at Rome, known by many as an honourable and earnest man, seeking in a corrupt
age to reform the morals of society. (In the present volume the reader will not fail to observe
the eulogistic language which Augustin often uses of Pelagius; see On the Merits of Sin, iii.
1, 5, 6.) Sundry theological treatises are even attributed to him; among them one On the
Trinity, of unquestionable orthodoxy, and showing great ability. Unfavourable reports,
however, afterwards began to be circulated, charging him with opening, in fact, entirely new
ground in the fields of heresy. During the previous centuries of Christian opinion the
speculations of active thinkers had been occupied on Theology properly so called, or the
doctrine of God as to His nature and personal attributes, including Christology, which treated
of Christ’s divine and human natures. This was objective divinity. With Pelagius, however,
a fresh class of subjects was forced on men’s attention: in his peculiar system of doctrine he
deals with what is subjective in man, and reviews the whole of his relation to God. His heresy
turns mainly upon two points—the assumed incorruptness of human nature, and the
denial of all supernatural influence upon the human will.</p>
<p>§ 3. He had an early associate in Coelestius, a native of Campania, according to some,
or as others say, of Ireland or of Scotland. This man, who is said to have been highly connected,
began life as an advocate, but, influenced by the advice and example of Pelagius, soon

<pb n="102"/>
became a monk. He excelled his master in boldness and energy; and thus early precipitated
the new doctrine into a formal dogmatism, from which the caution and subtler management
of Pelagius might have saved it. In the year A.D. 412 (Pelagius having just left him at Carthage
to go to Palestine), Coelestius was accused before the bishop Aurelius of holding and
teaching the following opinions:</p>
<p>1. Adam was created mortal, and must have died, even if he had not sinned; 2. Adam’s
sin injured himself only, and not mankind; 3. Infants are born in the state of Adam before
he fell; 4. Mankind neither died in Adam, nor rose again in Christ; 5. The Law, no less than
the Gospel, brings men to the kingdom of heaven; 6. There were sinless men before the
coming of Christ.199 What Coelestius thus boldly propounded, he had the courage to
maintain. On his refusal to retract, he was excommunicated. He threatened, or perhaps actually
though ineffectually made, an appeal to Rome, and afterwards quitted Carthage for
Ephesus.</p>
<p>§ 4. Augustin, who had for some time been occupied in the Donatist controversy, had
as yet taken no personal part in the proceedings against Coelestius. Soon, however, was his
attention directed to the new opinions, and he wrote the first two treatises contained in this
volume, in the year when Coelestius was excommunicated. At first he treated Pelagius, as
has been said, with deference and forbearance, hoping by courtesy to recall him from danger.
But as the heresy developed, Augustin’s opposition was more directly and vigorously exhibited.
The gospel was being fatally tampered with, in its essential facts of human sin and divine
grace; so, in the fulness of his own absolute loyalty to the entire volume of evangelical truth,
he concentrated his best efforts in opposition to the now formidable heresy. It is perhaps
not too much to say, that St. Augustin, the greatest doctor of the Catholic Church, effected
his greatness mainly by his labours against Pelagianism. Other Christian writers besides
Augustin have achieved results of decisive influence on the Church and its deposit of the
Christian faith. St. Athanasius, “alone against the world,” has often been referred to as a
splendid instance of what constancy, aided by God’s grace and a profound knowledge of
theology, could accomplish; St. Cyril of Alexandria, and St. Leo of Rome, might be also
quoted as signal proofs of the efficacy of catholic truth in opposition to popular heresy: these
men, under God, saved the Creed from the ravages of Arianism, and the subtler injuries of
Nestorius and Eutyches. Then, again, in the curious learning of the primitive Irenæus; in
the critical skill, and wide knowledge, and indomitable labours of Origen; in the catechetical
teaching of the elder Cyril; in the chaste descriptive power of Basil; in the simplicity and
self-denial of Ambrose; in the fervid eloquence of the “golden-mouthed” Chrysostom; in
the great learning of Jerome; in the scholastic accuracy of Damascene; and in the varied
<note type="footnote">199 Marius Mercator mentions a seventh opinion broached by Coelestius, to the effect that “infants, though
they be unbaptized, have everlasting life.”</note>

<pb n="103"/>
sacred gifts of other Christian worthies, from the impetuous Tertullian and the gentle
Cyprian, with all the Gregories of manifold endowments, down to the latest period of
patristic wisdom, graced by our own Anselm and the unrivalled preacher Bernard,—in all
these converging lines of diverse yet compatible accomplishments, the Church of Christ
has found, from age to age, ample reinforcements against the attacks of heretical hostility.
And in our great Bishop of Hippo one may trace, operating on various occasions in his
various works, the manifold characteristics which we have just enumerated of his brother
saints,—with this difference, that in no one of them are found combined the many traits
which constitute his greatness. We have here to do only with his anti-Pelagian writings.
Upon the whole, perhaps, these exhibit most of his wonderful resources of Christian character.
In many respects, one is reminded by him of the great apostle, whom he reverenced,
and whose profound doctrines he republished and vindicated. He has himself, in several of
his works, especially in his Confessions, admitted us to a view of the sharp convulsions and
bitter conflicts through which he passed, before his regeneration, into the Christian life,
animated by the free and sovereign grace of God, and adorned with his unflagging energies
in works of faith and love. From the depths of his own consciousness he instinctively felt
the dangers of Pelagianism, and he put forth his strength, as God enabled him, to meet the
evil; and the reader has in this volume samples in great variety of the earnestness of his
conflict with the new heresy and its leaders. These leaders he has himself characterized: “Ille
[nempe Coelestius] apertior, iste [scilicet Pelagius] occultior fuit; ille pertinacior, iste mendacior;
vel certe ille liberior, hic astutior;”200 and illustrations of the general correctness of
this estimate will be forthcoming, especially in the fourth treatise of this volume, where
Coelestius is dealt with, and in the fifth, which relates to the subterfuges and pretexts practised
by Pelagius in his proceedings in Palestine.</p>
<p>§ 5. The difference in the characters of the two leaders in this heresy contributed to
different results in their earlier proceedings. We have seen the disastrous issue to Coelestius
at Carthage, from his outspoken and unyielding conduct. The more reserved Pelagius, resorting
to a dexterous management of sundry favourable circumstances, obtained a friendly
hearing on two public occasions—at Jerusalem, in the summer of A.D. 415, and again at
the end of that year, in a council of fourteen bishops, at Diospolis, the ancient Lydda. In the
last treatise of this volume,201 the reader has a characteristic narrative of these events from
St. Augustin’s own pen. The holy man’s disappointment at the untoward results of these
two inquiries is apparent; but he struggles to maintain his respect for the bishops concerned
in the affair, and comforts himself and all Catholics with the assurance, which he thinks is
warranted by the proceedings, that the acquittal obtained by Pelagius, through the conceal-
<note type="footnote">200 De Peccato originali, [xii.] 13. See below.</note>
<note type="footnote">201 [i.e. On the Proceedings of Pelagius.]</note>

<pb n="104"/>
ment of his real opinions, amounted in fact to a condemnation of them. This volume terminates
with these transactions in Palestine; so that any remarks on the decline and fall of
Pelagianism proper must be postponed to a subsequent volume.</p>
<p>§ 6. St. Jerome as well as St. Augustin engaged in this controversy, and experienced in
the East some loss and much danger from the rougher followers of Pelagius.202 It is not
without interest that one observes the difference of view entertained by these eminent men
on the general question of the Pelagian heresy. Augustin had but an imperfect acquaintance
with either the language or the writings of the Greek Fathers, and had treated the Pelagian
opinions as unheard-of novelties. Jerome, however, who had acquired a competent knowledge
of the Christian literature of Greece during his long residence in the East, traced these
heretical opinions to the school of Origen, for whose memory he entertained but scant respect.
There is, no doubt, extravagance in Jerome’s censure, but withal a foundation of truth.
For from the beginning there was a tendency at least to divergent views between the Eastern
and the Western sections of Christendom, on the relation of the human will to the grace of
God in the matter of man’s conversion and salvation. On the general question, indeed, there
was always substantial agreement in the Catholic Church;—man, as he is born into the
world, is not in his originally perfect state; in order to be able to live according to his original
nature and to do good, he requires an inward change by the almighty power of God. But
this general agreement did not hinder specific differences of opinion, which having been
developed with considerable regularity, in East and West respectively, admit of some classification.
The chief writers of the West, especially Tertullian and Cyprian in the third century,
and Hilary of Poitiers and (notably) Ambrose in the fourth century, prominently state the
doctrine of man’s corruption, and the consequent necessity of a change of his nature by divine
grace; whilst the Alexandrian Fathers (especially Clement), and other Orientals (for instance,
Chrysostom), laid great stress upon human freedom, and on the indispensable co-operation
of this freedom with the grace of God. By the fifth century these tendencies were ready to
culminate; they were at length precipitated to a decisive controversy. In the Pelagian system,
the liberty which had been claimed for man was pushed to the heretical extreme of independence
of God’s help; while Augustin, in resisting this heresy, found it hard to keep clear of
the other extreme, of the absorption of human responsibility into the divine sovereignty.
Our author, no doubt, moves about on the confines of a deep insoluble mystery here; but,
upon the whole, it must be apparent to the careful reader how earnestly he tries to maintain
and vindicate man’s responsibility even amidst the endowments of God’s grace.</p>
<p>§ 7. Much has been written on the conduct of the two leading opponents in this controversy.
Sides (as usual) have been taken, and extreme opinions of praise and of blame have
been freely bestowed on both Augustin and Pelagius. It is impossible, even were it desirable,
<note type="footnote">202 See the Proceedings of Pelagius, c. 66.</note>

<pb n="105"/>
in this limited space to enter upon a question which, after all, hardly rises above the dignity
of mere personalities. The orthodox bishop and the heretical monk have had their share of
censure as to their mode of conducting the controversy. Augustin has been taxed with intolerance,
Pelagius with duplicity. We are perhaps not in a position to form an impartial
judgment on the case. To begin with, the evidence comes all from one side; and then the
critics pass their sentence according to the suggestions of modern prejudice, rather than by
the test of ancient contemporary facts, motives, and principles of action. A good deal of
obloquy has been cast on Augustin, as if he were responsible for the Rescript of Honorius
and its penalties; but this is (to say the least) a conclusion which outruns the premises. We
need say nothing of the peril which seriously threatened true religion when the half-informed
bishops of Palestine, and the vacillating Pope, all gave their hasty and ill-grounded approval
to Pelagius, as a justification of Augustin. He deeply felt the seriousness of the crisis, and
he unsheathed “the sword of the Spirit,” and dealt with it trenchant blows, every one of
which struck home with admirable precision; but it is not proved that he ever wielded the
civil sword of pains and penalties. Of all theological writers in ancient, medieval, or earlier
modern times, it may be fairly maintained that St. Augustin has shown himself the most
considerate, courteous, and charitable towards opponents. The reader will trace with some
interest the progress of his criticism on Pelagius. From the forbearance and love which he
gave him at first, 203 he passes slowly and painfully on to censure and condemnation, but
only as he detects stronger and stronger proofs of insincerity and bad faith.</p>
<p>§ 8. But whatever estimate we may form on the score of their personal conduct, there
can be no doubt of the bishop’s superiority over the monk, when we come to gauge the value
of their principles and doctrines, whether tested by Scripture or by the great facts of human
nature. Concerning the test of Scripture, our assertion will be denied by no one. No ancient
Christian writer approaches near St. Augustin in his general influence on the opinions and
belief of the Catholic Church, in its custody and interpretation of Holy Scripture; and there
can be no mistake either as to the Church’s uniform guardianship of the Augustinian doctrine,
taken as a whole, or as to its invariable resistance to the Pelagian system, whenever
and however it has been reproduced in the revolutions of human thought. There cannot be
found in all ecclesiastical history a more remarkable fact than the deference shown to the
<note type="footnote">203 For some time Augustin abstained from mentioning the name of Pelagius, to save him as much as he
could from exposure, and to avoid the irritation which might urge him to heresy from obstinacy. Augustin recognised
early enough the motive which influenced Pelagius at first. The latter dreaded the Antinomianism of
the day, and concentrated his teaching in a doctrine which was meant as a protest against it. “We would rather
not do injustice to our friends,” says Augustin, as he praises their “strong and active minds;” and he goes on to
commend Pelagius anonymously for “the zeal which he entertains against those who find a defence for their sins
in the infirmity of human nature.” See the third treatise of this volume, On Nature and Grace, ch. 6, 7.</note>

<pb n="106"/>
great Bishop of Hippo throughout Christendom, on all points of salient interest connected
with his name. Whatever basis of doctrine exists in common between the great sections of
Catholicism and Protestantism, was laid at first by the genius and piety of St. Augustin. In
the conflicts of the early centuries he was usually the champion of Scripture truth against
dangerous errors. In the Middle Ages his influence was paramount with the eminent men
who built up the scholastic system. In the modern Latin Church he enjoys greater consideration
than either Ambrose, or Hilary, or Jerome, or even Gregory the Great; and lastly, and
perhaps most strangely, he stands nearest to evangelical Protestantism, and led the van of
the great movement in the sixteenth century, which culminated in the Reformation. How
unique the influence which directed the minds of Anselm, and Bernard, and Aquinas, and
Bonaventure, with no less power than it swayed the thoughts of Luther, and Melanchthon,
and Zuingle, and Calvin!</p>
<p>§ 9. The key to this wonderful influence is Augustin’s knowledge of Holy Scripture, and
its profound suitableness to the facts and experience of our entire nature. Perhaps to no
one, not excepting St. Paul himself, has it been ever given so wholly and so deeply to suffer
the manifold experiences of the human heart, whether of sorrow and anguish from the
tyranny of sin, or of spiritual joy from the precious consolations of the grace of God. Augustin
speaks with authority here; he has traversed all the ground of inspired writ, and shown us
how true is its portraiture of man’s life. And, to pass on to our last point, he has threaded
the mazes of human consciousness; and in building up his doctrinal system, has been, in
the main, as true to the philosophy of fact as he is to the statements of revelation. He appears
in as favourable a contrast to his opponent in his philosophy as in his Scripture exegesis.
We cannot, however, in the limits of this Preface, illustrate this criticism with all the adducible
proofs; but we may quote one or two weak points which radically compromise Pelagius as
to the scientific bearings of his doctrine. By science we mean accurate knowledge, which
stands the test of the widest induction of facts. Now, it has been frequently remarked that
Pelagius is scientifically defective in the very centre of his doctrine,—on the freedom of the
will. His theory, especially in the hands of his vigorous followers, Coelestius and Julianus,204
ignored the influence of habit on human volition, and the development of habits from action,
isolating human acts, making man’s power of choice (his liberum arbitrium) a mere natural
faculty, of physical, not moral operation. How defective this view is,—how it impoverishes
the moral nature of man, strips it of the very elements of its composition, and drops out of
consideration the many facts of human life, which interlace themselves in our experience
as the very web and woof of moral virtue,—is manifest to the students of Aristotle and
<note type="footnote">204 We make this qualification, because Pelagius himself seems to have recognised to some extent the power
of habit and its effect upon the will, in his Letter to Demetrias, 8. See Dr. Philip Schaff’s History of the Christian
Church, vol. iii. p. 804.</note>

<pb n="107"/>
Butler.205 Acts are not mere insulated atoms, merely done, and then done with; but they
have a relation to the will, and an influence upon subsequent acts: and so acts generate
habits, and habits produce character, the formal cause of man’s moral condition. The same
defect runs through the Pelagian system. Passing from the subject of human freedom, and
the effect of action upon conduct and habit, we come to Pelagius’ view of sin. According to
him, Adam’s transgression consisted in an isolated act of disobedience to God’s command;
and our sin now consists in the mere repetition and imitation of his offence. There was no
“original sin,” and consequently no hereditary guilt. Adam stood alone in his transgression,
and transmitted no evil taint to his posterity, much less any tendency or predisposition to
wrong-doing: there was no doubt a bad example, but against this Pelagius complacently set
the happier examples of good and prudent men. Isolation, then, is the principle of Pelagius
and his school; organization is the principle of true philosophy, as tested by the experience
and observation of mankind.</p>
<p>§ 10. We have said enough, and we hope not unfairly said it, to show that Pelagius was
radically at fault in his deductions, whether tested by divine revelation or human experience.
How superior to him in all essential points his great opponent was, will be manifest to the
reader of this volume. Not a statement of Scripture, nor a fact of nature, does Augustin find
it necessary to soften, or repudiate, or ignore. Hence his writings are valuable in illustrating
the harmony between revelation and true philosophy; we have seen how much of his farseeing
and eminent knowledge was owing to his own deep convictions and discoveries of
sin and grace; perhaps we shall not be wrong in saying, that even to his opponents is due
something of his excellence. There can be no doubt that in Pelagius and Coelestius, and his
still more able follower Julianus, of whom we shall hear in a future volume, he had very able
opponents—men of earnest character, acute in observation and reasoning, impressed with
the truth of their convictions, and deeming it a fit occupation to rationalize the meaning of
Scripture in its bearings on human experience. There is a remarkable peculiarity in this respect
in the opinions of Pelagius. He accepted the mysteries of theology, properly so called,
with the most exemplary orthodoxy. Nothing could be better than his exposition of the
doctrine of the Holy Trinity. But again we find him hemmed in with a perverse isolation.
The doctrine of the Trinity, according to him, stands alone; it sheds no influence on man
and his eternal interests; but in the blessed Scripture, as read by Augustin, there is revealed
to man a most intimate relation between himself and God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, as his Creator, his Redeemer, and his Sanctifier. In Pelagianism, then, we see a disjointed
and unconnected theory,—a creed which stands apart from practical life, and is not
allowed to shape man’s conduct,—a system, in short, which falls to pieces for want of the
coherence of the true “analogy of the faith” which worketh by love. By exposing, therefore,
<note type="footnote">205 Aristotle, Ethic. Nicom. ii. 2, 3, 6; Butler, Analogy, i. 5.</note>

<pb n="108"/>
this incompatibility in the doctrine of his opponents, Augustin shows how irreconcilable
are the deductions of their Rationalism with the statements of Revelation. But Rationalism
is not confined to any one period. We live to see a bolder Rationalism, which, unlike Pelagius’,
is absolutely uncompromising in its aims, and (as must be admitted) more consistent in its
method. To institute the supremacy of Reason, it destroys more or less the mysteries of
Religion. All the miraculous element of the gospel is discarded; God’s personal relation to
man in the procedures of grace, and man’s to God in the discipline of repentance, faith, and
love, are abolished: nay, the Divine Personality itself merges into an impalpable, uninfluential
Pantheism; while man’s individual responsibility is absorbed into a mythical personification
of the race. The only sure escape from such a desolation as this, is to recur to the good old
paths of gospel faith—“stare super antiquas vias.” Our directory for life’s journey through
these is furnished to us in Holy Scripture; and if an interpreter is wanted who shall be able
by competent knowledge and ample experience to explain to us any difficulties of direction,
we know none more suited for the purpose than our St. Augustin.</p>
<p>§ 11. But Rationalism is not always so exaggerated as this: in its ordinary development,
indeed, it stops short of open warfare with Revelation, and (at whatever cost of logical consistency)
it will accommodate its discussions to the form of Scripture. This adaptation gives
it double force: there is its own intrinsic principle of uncontrolled liberty in will and action,
and there is “the form of godliness,” which has weight with unreflective Christians. Hence
Pelagianism was undoubtedly popular: it offered dignity to human nature, and flattered its
capacity; and this it did without virulence and with sincerity, under the form of religion.
This acquiescence of matter and manner gave it strength in men’s sympathies, and has secured
for it durability, seeing that there is plenty of it still amongst us; as indeed there always
has been, and ever will be, so long as the fatal ambition of Eden (Gen. iii. 5, 6) shall seduce
men into a temper of rivalry with God. Writers like Paley (in his Evidences) have treated
of the triumph of Christianity over difficulties of every kind. Of all the stumbling-blocks to
the holy religion of our blessed Saviour, not one has proved so influential as its doctrine of
Grace; the prejudice against it, by what St. Paul calls “the natural man” (1 Cor. ii. 14), is ineradicable—
and, it may be added, inevitable: for in his independence and self-sufficiency
he cannot admit that in himself he is nothing, but requires external help to rescue him from
sin, and through imparted holiness to elevate him to the perfection of the blessed. How
great, then, is the benefit which Augustin has accomplished for the gospel, in probing the
grounds of this natural prejudice against it, and showing its ultimate untenableness—the
moment it is tested on the deeper principles of the divine appreciation! No, the ultimate
effect of the doctrine and operation of grace is not to depreciate the true dignity of man. If
there be the humbling process first, it is only that out of the humility should emerge the
exaltation at last (1 Pet. v. 6). I know nothing in the whole range of practical or theoretical
divinity more beautiful than Augustin’s analysis of the procedures of grace, in raising man

<pb n="109"/>
from the depths of his sinful prostration to the heights of his last and eternal elevation in
the presence and fellowship of God. The most ambitious, who thinks “man was not made
for meanness,” might be well content with the noble prospect. But his ambition must submit
to the conditions; and his capacity both for the attainment and the fruition of such a destiny
is given to him and trained by God Himself. “It is so contrived,” says Augustin, “in the discipline
of the present life, that the holy Church shall arrive at last at that condition of unspotted
purity which all holy men desire; and that it may in the world to come, and in a state
unmixed with all soil of evil men, and undisturbed by any law of sin resisting the law of the
mind, lead the purest life in a divine eternity.…But in whatever place and at what time soever
the love which animates the good shall reach that state of absolute perfection which shall
admit of no increase, it is certainly not ‘shed abroad in our hearts’ by any energies either of
the nature or the volition that are within us, but ‘by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us’
(Rom. v. 5), and which both helps our infirmity and co-operates with our strength” (On
Nature and Grace, chs. 74 and 84).</p>

<head>Preface to Volume II. Of the Edinburgh Edition.</head>
<p>This volume contains a translation of the three following treatises by St. Augustin on
the Pelagian controversy:—</p>
<p>De Gratia Christi, et De Peccato originali contra Pelagium et Coelestium, ad Albinam,
Pinianum, et Melaniam; libri duo, scripti anno Christi 418.</p>
<p>De Nuptiis et Concupiscentiâ ad Valerium Comitem; libri duo, scriptus alter circiter
initium anni 419; alter anno Christi 420.</p>
<p>De Animâ et ejus origine, contra Vincentium Victorem; libri quatuor, scriptus sub finem
anni Christi 419.</p>
<p>These, with the contents of our former volume, comprise eight of the fifteen works
contributed by the great author to the defence of the Catholic faith against Pelagius and his
most conspicuous followers. The prefaces and chapter headings, which have been, as heretofore,
transferred to their proper places in this volume from the Benedictine edition of the
original, will afford the reader preliminary help enough, and thus render more than a few
general prefatory remarks unnecessary here.</p>
<p>The second book in the first of these treatises adds some facts to the historical information
contained in our preceding volume; Pelagius is shown to be at one, in the main, with
Coelestius, the bolder but less specious heretic. They were condemned everywhere—even
at Rome by Pope Zosimus, who had at first shown some favour to them. These authoritative
proceedings against them gave a sensible check to their progress in public; there is, however,
reason to believe that the opinions, which the Pelagian teachers had with great industry,
and with their varied ability, propounded, had created much interest and even anxiety in
private society. The early part of the first of the following treatises throws some light on this
point, and on the artful methods by which the heretics sought to maintain and extend their
opinions; it affords some evidence also of the widespread influence of St. Augustin. The
controversy had engaged the attention of a pious family in Palestine; Pelagius was in the
neighbourhood; and when frankly questioned by the friends, he strongly protested his adherence
to the doctrine of Grace. “I anathematize,” he exclaimed with suspicious promptitude,
“the man who holds that the grace of God is not necessary for us at every moment and in
every act of our lives: and all who endeavour to disannul it, deserve everlasting punishment.”
It was an act of astonishing duplicity, which Augustin, to whom the case was referred, soon
detected and exposed. It is satisfactory to find that the worthy Christians to whom the Saint
addressed his loving labour were confirmed in their simple faith; and in one of the last of
his extant letters, towards the close of his days on earth, the venerable St. Jerome, in the
course of the following year, united the gratitude of Albina, Pinianus, and Melania, with his

<pb n="111"/>
own to his renowned brother in the west, whom he saluted as “the restorer of the ancient
faith.” “Macte virtute,” said the venerable man, “in orbe celebraris; et, quod signum majoris
est gloriæ, omnes heretici detestantur.” <del>Go on and prosper; the whole world endows thee
with its praise, and all heretics with their hatred.</del></p>
<p>In the latter part of the first treatise in this volume, one of the most formidable of the
Pelagian objections to the Catholic doctrine of original sin is thrown out against marriage:
“Surely that could not be a holy state, instituted of God, which produced human beings in
sin!” Augustin in a few weighty chapters removes the doubts of his perplexed correspondents,
and reserves his strength for the full treatment of the subject in the second treatise, here
translated, On Marriage and Concupiscence. It is a noble monument of his firm grasp of
Scripture truth, his loyal adherence to its plain meaning, and his delicate and, at the same
time, intrepid handling of a subject, which could only be touched by a man whose mind
possessed a deep knowledge of human nature—both in its moral and its physiological aspects,
and in its relations to God as affected by its creation, its fall, and its redemption.</p>
<p>This treatise introduces us to a change of circumstances. The preceding one was, as we
have seen, addressed to a small group of simple believers in sacred truth, who were not
personally known to the author, and, though zealous in the maintenance of the faith, occupied
only a private place in society; but the present work was written at the urgent request of a
nobleman in high office as a minister of state, and well known to the writer. It is pleasant
to trace a similar earnestness, in such dissimilar ranks, in the defence of the assailed faith:
and it illustrates the wide stretch of mind and comprehensive love of Augustin, that he could
so promptly sympathize with the anxieties of all classes and conditions in the Christian life;
and, what is more, so administer comfort and conviction out of the treasures of his wisdom,
as to settle their doubts and reassure them in faith. Nor does the change end here. Instead
of Pelagius and Coelestius, Augustin has in this work to confute the powerful argument of
Julianus, bishop of Celanum, the ablest of his Pelagian opponents. This man was really the
mainstay of the heresy; he had greater resources of mind and a firmer character than either
of his associates;—more candid and sincere than Pelagius, and less ambitious and impatient
than Coelestius, he seemed to contend for truth for its own sake, and this disposition found
a complete response in the Church’s earnest and accomplished champion. Notwithstanding
the difficulty and delicacy of the subject, which removes, no doubt, the treatise De Nuptiis
et Concupisentiâ out of the category of what is called “general reading,” the great author
never did a higher service to the faith than when he provided for it this defence of a fundamental
point. The venerable Jerome rejoiced at the good service, and longed to embrace his
brother Saint from his distant retreat of Bethlehem. “Testem invoco Deum,” he wrote to
Augustin, and his dear friend and helper Alypius, “quod si posset fieri, assumptis alis
columbæ, vestris amplexibus implicarer.”</p>

<pb n="112"/>
<p>In the last and longest work, translated for this volume, we come upon a change, both
of subject and circumstances, as complete as that we have just noticed. Vincentius Victor,
whose unsafe opinions are reviewed, was a young African of great ability and rhetorical accomplishment.
His fluent tongue had fairly bewitched not only crowds of thoughtless
hearers, but staid persons, whose faith should have been proof against a seductive influence
which was soon shown to be transient and flimsy. The young disputant seems to have been
more of a schismatic in the Donatist party, than a heretic with Pelagius; showy, however,
and unstable, and hardly weighing the consequence of his own opinions, he began to air his
metaphysics, and soon fell into strange errors about the nature and origin of the human
soul. In his youthful arrogance he happened to censure Augustin for his cautious teaching
on so profound a subject; kindly does the aged bishop receive the criticism, show its unreasonableness,
and point out to his rash assailant some serious errors which he was propounding
at random. He also reproves one of Victor’s friends, who happened to be a presbyter, for
allowing himself to be misled by the young man’s eloquent sophistry; and in the latter half
of his treatise, with fatherly love and earnestness, he advises Victor to renounce his dangerous
errors, some of which were rankly Pelagian, and something worse. The result of Augustin’s
admonitions—adorned as they were with great depth and width of reflection and knowledge
(extending this time even to physical science, on some facts of which he playfully comments
with the ease of a modern experimenter), with loving consideration for his opponent’s inexperience,
kindly deference to his undoubted abilities, and a pious desire to win him over to
the cause of truth and godliness—was entirely satisfactory. We find from the Retractations
(ii. 56), that Victor in time abjured all his errors, and doubtless, like another Apollos, ably
employed his best powers in the service of true religion. This was a real trophy, great among
the greatest of Augustin’s achievements for faith and charity. For so great a soul to stoop to
the level of so captious a spirit, and with industrious love and patience to trace out and refute
all its ambitious error, was “a labour of love” indeed. He remembered the wise counsel of
the apostle: “Count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother;” and he reaped
the victory the Saviour promised: “Thou hast gained thy brother.”</p>

<head>EXTRACT FROM AUGUSTIN’S “RETRACTATIONS,”
Book II. Chap. 23,
ON THE FOLLOWING TREATISE,
“DE PECCATORUM MERITIS ET REMISSIONE.”</head>
<p>A Necessity arose which compelled me to write against the new heresy of Pelagius. Our
previous opposition to it was confined to sermons and conversations, as occasions suggested,
and according to our respective abilities and duties; but it had not yet assumed the shape
of a controversy in writing. Certain questions were then submitted to me [by our brethren]
at Carthage, to which I was to send them back answers in writing; I accordingly wrote first
of all three books, under the title “On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins,” in which I mainly
discussed the baptism of infants because of original sin, and the grace of God by which we
are justified, that is, made righteous; but [I remarked] no man in this life can so keep the
commandments which prescribe holiness of life, as to be beyond the necessity of using this
prayer for his sins: “Forgive us our trespasses.”207 It is in direct opposition to these principles
that they have devised their new heresy. Now throughout these three books I thought it
right not to mention any of their names, hoping and desiring that by such reserve they might
the more readily be set right; nay more, in the third book (which is really a letter, but reckoned
amongst the books, because I wished to connect it with the two previous ones) I actually
quoted Pelagius’ name with considerable commendation, because his conduct and life were
made a good deal of by many persons; and those statements of his which I refuted, he had
himself adduced in his writings, not indeed in his own name, but had quoted them as the
words of other persons. However, when he was afterwards confirmed in heresy, he defended
them with most persistent animosity. Coelestius, indeed, a disciple of his, had already been
excommunicated for similar opinions at Carthage, in a council of bishops, at which I was
not present. In a certain passage of my second book I used these words: “Upon some there
will be bestowed this blessing at the last day, that they shall not perceive the actual suffering
of death in the suddenness of the change which shall happen to them;”208—reserving the
passage for a more careful consideration of the subject; for they will either die, or else by a
most rapid transition from this life to death, and then from death to eternal life, as in the
twinkling of an eye, they will not undergo the feeling of mortality. This work of mine begins
with this sentence: “However absorbing and intense the anxieties and annoyances.”</p>

the penalty of sin; He then proceeds to prove that in Adam’s sin his entire offspring is
implicated, showing that infants are baptized for the express purpose of receiving the remission

<p>Howeverabsorbing and intense the anxieties and annoyances in the whirl and warmth
of which we are engaged with sinful men209 who forsake the law of God,—even though we
may well ascribe these very evils to the fault of our own sins,—I am unwilling, and, to say
the truth, unable, any longer to remain a debtor, my dearest Marcellinus,210 to that zealous
affection of yours, which only enhances my own grateful and pleasant estimate of yourself.
I am under the impulse [of a twofold emotion]: on the one hand, there is that very love
which makes us unchangeably one in the one hope of a change for the better; on the other
hand, there is the fear of offending God in yourself, who has given you so earnest a desire;
in gratifying which I shall be only serving Him who has given it to you. And so strongly has
this impulse led and attracted me to solve, to the best of my humble ability, the questions
which you have submitted to me in writing, that my mind has gradually admitted this inquiry
to an importance transcending that of all others; [and it will now give me no rest] until I
accomplish something which shall make it manifest that I have yielded, if not a sufficient,
yet at any rate an obedient, compliance with your own kind wish and the desire of those to
whom these questions are a source of anxiety.</p>

the parties, that met in Carthage on the 1st, 3d, and 8th of June, 411. He discharged this whole business with
singular patience, moderation, and good judgment; which appears to have cemented the intimate friendship
between him and Augustin. Augustin’s treatise on The Spirit and Letter is also addressed to him, and he undertook

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>If Adam Had Not Sinned, He Would Never Have Died</head>
<p>They who say that Adam was so formed that he would even without any demerit of sin
have died, not as the penalty of sin, but from the necessity of his being, endeavour indeed
to refer that passage in the law, which says: “On the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die,”211
not to the death of the body, but to that death of the soul which takes place in sin. It is the
unbelievers who have died this death, to whom the Lord pointed when He said, “Let the
dead bury their dead.”212 Now what will be their answer, when we read that God, when reproving
and sentencing the first man after his sin, said to him, “Dust thou art, and unto
dust shalt thou return?”213 For it was not in respect of his soul that he was “dust,” but clearly
by reason of his body, and it was by the death of the self-same body that he was destined to
“return to dust.” Still, although it was by reason of his body that he was dust, and although
he bare about the natural body in which he was created, he would, if he had not sinned,
have been changed into a spiritual body, and would have passed into the incorruptible state,
which is promised to the faithful and the saints, without the peril of death.214 And for this
issue we not only are conscious in ourselves of having an earnest desire, but we learn it from
the apostle’s intimation, when he says: “For in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon
with our habitation which is from heaven; if so be that being clothed we shall not be found
naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would
be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life.” 215 Therefore,
if Adam had not sinned, he would not have been divested of his body, but would have been
clothed upon with immortality and incorruption, that “mortality might have been swallowed
up of life;” that is, that he might have passed from the natural body into the spiritual body.</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>III.</del>It is One Thing to Be Mortal, Another Thing to Be Subject to Death.</head>
<p>Nor was there any reason to fear that if he had happened to live on here longer in his
natural body, he would have been oppressed with old age, and have gradually, by increasing
age, arrived at death. For if God granted to the clothes and the shoes of the Israelites that
“they waxed not old” during so many years,216 what wonder if for obedience it had been by
the power of the same [God] allowed to man, that although he had a natural and mortal
body, he should have in it a certain condition, in which he might grow full of years without
decrepitude, and, whenever God pleased, pass from mortality to immortality without the
medium of death? For even as this very flesh of ours, which we now possess, is not therefore
invulnerable, because it is not necessary that it should be wounded; so also was his not
therefore immortal, because there was no necessity for its dying. Such a condition, whilst
still in their natural and mortal body, I suppose, was granted even to those who were translated
hence without death.217 For Enoch and Elijah were not reduced to the decrepitude of
old age by their long life. But yet I do not believe that they were then changed into that
spiritual kind of body, such as is promised in the resurrection, and which the Lord was the
first to receive; only they probably do not need those aliments, which by their use minister
refreshment to the body; but ever since their translation they so live, as to enjoy such a sufficiency
as was provided during the forty days in which Elijah lived on the cruse of water
and the cake, without substantial food;218 or else, if there be any need of such sustenance,
they are, it may be, sustained in Paradise in some such way as Adam was, before he brought
on himself expulsion therefrom by sinning. And he, as I suppose, was supplied with
sustenance against decay from the fruit of the various trees, and from the tree of life with
security against old age.</p>

<p>But in addition to the passage where God in punishment said, “Dust thou art, unto dust
shalt thou return,”219—a passage which I cannot understand how any one can apply except
to the death of the body,—there are other testimonies likewise, from which it most fully
appears that by reason of sin the human race has brought upon itself not spiritual death
merely, but the death of the body also. The apostle says to the Romans: “But if Christ be in
you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. If therefore
the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ
Jesus from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in
you.”220 I think that so clear and open a sentence as this only requires to be read, and not
expounded. The body, says he, is dead, not because of earthly frailty, as being made of the
dust of the ground, but because of sin; what more do we want? And he is most careful in his
words: he does not say “is mortal,” but “dead.”</p>

<head>Chapter 5 <del>V.</del>The Words, Mortale (Capable of Dying), Mortuum (Dead), and
Moriturus (Destined to Die).</head>
<p>Now previous to the change into the incorruptible state which is promised in the resurrection
of the saints, the body could be mortal (capable of dying), although not destined to
die (moriturus); just as our body in its present state can, so to speak, be capable of sickness,
although not destined to be sick. For whose is the flesh which is incapable of sickness, even
if from some accident it die before it ever is sick? In like manner was man’s body then
mortal; and this mortality was to have been superseded by an eternal incorruption, if man
had persevered in righteousness, that is to say, obedience: but even what was mortal (mortale)
was not made dead (mortuum), except on account of sin. For the change which is to come
in at the resurrection is, in truth, not only not to have death incidental to it, which has
happened through sin, but neither is it to have mortality, [or the very possibility of death,]
which the natural body had before it sinned. He does not say: “He that raised up Christ Jesus
from the dead shall quicken also your dead bodies” (although he had previously said, “the
body is dead”221); but his words are: “He shall quicken also your mortal bodies;”222 so that
they are not only no longer dead, but no longer mortal [or capable of dying], since the natural
is raised spiritual, and this mortal body shall put on immortality, and mortality shall
be swallowed up in life.223</p>

<head>Chapter 6 <del>VI.</del>How It is that the Body Dead Because of Sin.</head>
<p>One wonders that anything is required clearer than the proof we have given. But we
must perhaps be content to hear this clear illustration gainsaid by the contention, that we
must understand “the dead body” here224 in the sense of the passage where it is said,
“Mortify your members which are upon the earth.”225 But it is because of righteousness and
not because of sin that the body is in this sense mortified; for it is to do the works of righteousness
that we mortify our bodies which are upon the earth. Or if they suppose that the
phrase, “because of sin,” is added, not that we should understand “because sin has been
committed,” but “in order that sin may not be committed”—as if it were said, “The body
indeed is dead, in order to prevent the commission of sin:” what then does he mean in the
next clause by adding the words, “because of righteousness,” to the statement, “The spirit
is life?”226 For it would have been enough simply to have adjoined “the spirit is life,” to have
secured that we should supply here too, “in order to prevent the commission of sin;” so that
we should thus understand the two propositions to point to one thing—that both “the body
is dead,” and “the spirit is life,” for the one common purpose of “preventing the commission
of sin.” So likewise if he had merely meant to say, “because of righteousness,” in the sense
of “for the purpose of doing righteousness,” the two clauses might possibly be referred to
this one purpose—to the effect, that both “the body is dead,” and “the spirit is life,” “for the
purpose of doing righteousness.” But as the passage actually stands, it declares that “the
body is dead because of sin,” and “the spirit is life because of righteousness,” attributing
different merits to different things—the demerit of sin to the death of the body, and the
merit of righteousness to the life of the spirit. Wherefore if, as no one can doubt, “the spirit
is life because of righteousness,” that is, as the desert, of righteousness; how ought we, or
can we, understand by the statement, “The body is dead because of sin,” anything else than
that the body is dead as the desert of sin, unless indeed we try to pervert or wrest the plainest
sense of Scripture to our own arbitrary will? But besides this, additional light is afforded by
the words which follow. For it is with limitation to the present time, when he says, that on
the one hand “the body is dead because of sin,” since, whilst the body is unrenovated by the
resurrection, there remains in it the desert of sin, that is, the necessity of dying; and on the
other hand, that “the spirit is life because of righteousness,” since, notwithstanding the fact
of our being still burdened with “the body of this death,”227 we have already by the renewal
which is begun in our inner man, new aspirations228 after the righteousness of faith. Yet,

lest man in his ignorance should fail to entertain hope of the resurrection of the body, he
says that the very body which he had just declared to be “dead because of sin” in this world,
will in the next world be made alive “because of righteousness,”—and that not only in such
a way as to become alive from the dead, but immortal from its mortality.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>VII.</del>The Life of the Body the Object of Hope, the Life of the Spirit
Being a Prelude to It.</head>
<p>Although I am much afraid that so clear a matter may rather be obscured by exposition,
I must yet request your attention to the luminous statement of the apostle. “But if Christ,”
says he, “be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of
righteousness.”229 Now this is said, that men may not suppose that they derive no benefit,
or but scant benefit, from the grace of Christ, seeing that they must needs die in the body.
For they are bound to remember that, although their body still bears that desert of sin, which
is irrevocably bound to the condition of death, yet their spirit has already begun to live because
of the righteousness of faith, although it had actually become extinct by the death, as
it were, of unbelief. No small gift, therefore, he says, must you suppose to have been conferred
upon you, by the circumstance that Christ is in you; inasmuch as in the body, which is dead
because of sin, your spirit is even now alive because of righteousness; so that therefore you
should not despair of the life even of your body. “For if the Spirit of Him that raised up
Christ from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall quicken also
your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.”230 How is it that fumes of controversy
still darken so clear a light? The apostle distinctly tells you, that although the body is dead
because of sin within you, yet even your mortal bodies shall be made alive because of righteousness,
because of which even now your spirit is life,—the whole of which process is to
be perfected by the grace of Christ, that is, by His Spirit dwelling in you: and men still contradict!
He goes on to tell us how it comes to pass that life converts death into itself by
mortifying it. “Therefore, brethren,” says he, “we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after
the flesh; for if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the spirit do mortify the
deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.”231 What else does this mean but this: If ye live according
to death, ye shall wholly die; but if by living according to life ye mortify death, ye shall wholly
live?</p>

<head>Chapter 8 <del>VIII.</del>Bodily Death from Adam’s Sin.</head>
<p>When to the like purport he says: “By man came death, by man also the resurrection of
the dead,”232 in what other sense can the passage be understood than of the death of the
body; for having in view the mention of this, he proceeded to speak of the resurrection of
the body, and affirmed it in a most earnest and solemn discourse? In these words, addressed
to the Corinthians: “By man came death, and by man came also the resurrection of the dead;
for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,”233—what other meaning
is indeed conveyed than in the verse in which he says to the Romans, “By one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin?”234 Now they will have it, that the death here
meant is the death, not of the body, but of the soul, on the pretence that another thing is
spoken of to the Corinthians, where they are quite unable to understand the death of the
soul, because the subject there treated is the resurrection of the body, which is the antithesis
of the death of the body. The reason, moreover, why only death is here mentioned as caused
by man, and not sin also, is because the point of the discourse is not about righteousness,
which is the antithesis of sin, but about the resurrection of the body, which is contrasted
with the death of the body.</p>

<head>Chapter 9 <del>IX.</del>—Sin Passes on to All Men by Natural Descent, and Not Merely by
Imitation.</head>
<p>You tell me in your letter, that they endeavour to twist into some new sense the passage
of the apostle, in which he says: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;”235
yet you have not informed me what they suppose to be the meaning of these words. But so
far as I have discovered from others, they think that the death which is here mentioned is
not the death of the body, which they will not allow Adam to have deserved by his sin, but
that of the soul, which takes place in actual sin; and that this actual sin has not been transmitted
from the first man to other persons by natural descent, but by imitation. Hence,
likewise, they refuse to believe that in infants original sin is remitted through baptism, for
they contend that no such original sin exists at all in people by their birth. But if the apostle
had wished to assert that sin entered into the world, not by natural descent, but by imitation,
he would have mentioned as the first offender, not Adam indeed, but the devil, of whom it
is written,236 that “he sinneth from the beginning;” of whom also we read in the Book of
Wisdom: “Nevertheless through the devil’s envy death entered into the world.”237 Now,
forasmuch as this death came upon men from the devil, not because they were propagated
by him, but because they imitated his example, it is immediately added: “And they that do
hold of his side do imitate him.”238 Accordingly, the apostle, when mentioning sin and
death together, which had passed by natural descent from one upon all men, set him down
as the introducer thereof from whom the propagation of the human race took its beginning.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—The Analogy of Grace.</head>
<p>No doubt all they imitate Adam who by disobedience transgress the commandment of
God; but he is one thing as an example to those who sin because they choose; and another
thing as the progenitor of all who are born with sin. All His saints, also, imitate Christ in
the pursuit of righteousness; whence the same apostle, whom we have already quoted, says:
“Be ye imitators of me, as I am also of Christ.”239 But besides this imitation, His grace works
within us our illumination and justification, by that operation concerning which the same
preacher of His [name] says: “Neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth,
but God that giveth the increase.”240 For by this grace He engrafts into His body even baptized
infants, who certainly have not yet become able to imitate any one. As therefore He,
in whom all are made alive, besides offering Himself as an example of righteousness to those
who imitate Him, gives also to those who believe on Him the hidden grace of His Spirit,
which He secretly infuses even into infants; so likewise he, in whom all die, besides being
an example for imitation to those who wilfully transgress the commandment of the Lord,
depraved also in his own person all who come of his stock by the hidden corruption of his
own carnal concupiscence. It is entirely on this account, and for no other reason, that the
apostle says: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so passed upon
all men; in which all have sinned.”241 Now if I were to say this, they would raise an objection,
and loudly insist that I was incorrect both in expression and sense; for they would perceive
no sense in these words when spoken by an ordinary man, except that sense which they refuse
to see in the apostle. Since, however, these are the words of him to whose authority and
doctrine they submit, they charge us with slowness of understanding, while they endeavour
to wrest to some unintelligible sense words which were written in a clear and obvious purport.
“By one man,” says he, “sin entered into the world, and death by sin.” This indicates
propagation, not imitation; for if imitation were meant, he would have said, “By the devil.”
But as no one doubts, he refers to that first man who is called Adam: “And so,” says he, “it
passed upon all men.”</p>

<head>Chapter 11 <del>X.</del>—Distinction Between Actual and Original Sin.242</head>
<p>Again, in the clause which follows, “In which all have sinned,” how cautiously, rightly,
and unambiguously is the statement expressed! For if you understand that sin to be meant
which by one man entered into the world, “In which [sin] all have sinned,” it is surely clear
enough, that the sins which are peculiar to every man, which they themselves commit and
which belong simply to them, mean one thing; and that the one sin, in and by which all have
sinned, means another thing; since all were that one man. If, however, it be not the sin, but
that one man that is understood, “In which [one man] all have sinned,” what again can be
plainer than even this clear statement? We read, indeed, of those being justified in Christ
who believe in Him, by reason of the secret communion and inspiration of that spiritual
grace which makes every one who cleaves to the Lord “one spirit” with Him,243 although
His saints also imitate His example; can I find, however, any similar statement made of those
who have imitated His saints? Can any man be said to be justified in Paul or in Peter, or in
any one whatever of those excellent men whose authority stands high among the people of
God? We are no doubt said to be blessed in Abraham, according to the passage in which it
was said to him, “In thee shall all nations be blessed”244—for Christ’s sake, who is his seed
according to the flesh; which is still more clearly expressed in the parallel passage: “In thy
seed shall all nations be blessed.” I do not believe that any one can find it anywhere stated
in the Holy Scriptures, that a man has ever sinned or still sins “in the devil,” although all
wicked and impious men “imitate” him. The apostle, however, has declared concerning the
first man, that “in him all have sinned;”245 and yet there is still a contest about the
propagation of sin, and men oppose to it I know not what nebulous theory of “imitation.”246</p>

<p>Observe also what follows. Having said, “In which all have sinned,” he at once added,
“For until the law, sin was in the world.”247 This means that sin could not be taken away
even by the law, which entered that sin might the more abound,248 whether it be the law of
nature, under which every man when arrived at years of discretion only proceeds to add his
own sins to original sin, or that very law which Moses gave to the people. “For if there had
been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the
law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ
might be given to them that believe.249 But sin is not imputed where there is no law.”250
Now what means the phrase “is not imputed,” but “is ignored,” or “is not reckoned as sin?”
Although the Lord God does not Himself regard it as if it had never been, since it is written:
“As many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law.”251</p>

<head>Chapter 13 <del>XI.</del>—Meaning of the Apostle’s Phrase “The Reign of Death.”</head>
<p>“Nevertheless,” says he, “death reigned from Adam even unto Moses,”252—that is to
say, from the first man even to the very law which was promulged by the divine authority,
because even it was unable to abolish the reign of death. Now death must be understood
“to reign,” whenever the guilt of sin253 so dominates in men that it prevents their attainment
of that eternal life which is the only true life, and drags them down even to the second death
which is penally eternal. This reign of death is only destroyed in any man by the Saviour’s
grace, which wrought even in the saints of the olden time, all of whom, though previous to
the coming of Christ in the flesh, yet lived in relation to His assisting grace, not to the letter
of the law, which only knew how to command, but not to help them. In the Old Testament,
indeed, that was hidden (conformably to the perfectly just dispensation of the times) which
is now revealed in the New Testament. Therefore “death reigned from Adam unto Moses,”
in all who were not assisted by the grace of Christ, that in them the kingdom of death might
be destroyed, “even in those who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression,”
254 that is, who had not yet sinned of their own individual will, as Adam did, but had
drawn from him original sin, “who is the figure of him that was to come,”255 because in
him was constituted the form of condemnation to his future progeny, who should spring
from him by natural descent; so that from one all men were born to a condemnation, from
which there is no deliverance but in the Saviour’s grace. I am quite aware, indeed, that several
Latin copies of the Scriptures read the passage thus: “Death reigned from Adam to
Moses over them who have sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression;”256 but
even this version is referred by those who so read it to the very same purport, for they understood
those who have sinned in him to have sinned after the similitude of Adam’s
transgression; so that they are created in his likeness, not only as men born of a man, but
as sinners born of a sinner, dying ones of a dying one, and condemned ones to a condemned
one. However, the Greek copies from which the Latin version was made, have all, without
exception or nearly so, the reading which I first adduced.</p>

Man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.”257 Not many more, that is, many more men,
for there are not more persons justified than condemned; but it runs, much more hath
abounded; inasmuch as, while Adam produced sinners from his one sin, Christ has by His
grace procured free forgiveness even for the sins which men have of their own accord added
by actual transgression to the original sin in which they were born. This he states more

<head>Chapter 15 <del>XII.</del>—The One Sin Common to All Men.</head>
<p>But observe more attentively what he says, that “through the offence of one, many are
dead.” For why should it be on account of the sin of one, and not rather on account of their
own sins, if this passage is to be understood of imitation, and not of propagation?258 But
mark what follows: “And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgment
was by one to condemnation, but the grace is of many offences unto justification.”259 Now
let them tell us, where there is room in these words for imitation. “By one,” says he, “to
condemnation.” By one what except one sin? This, indeed, he clearly implies in the words
which he adds: “But the grace is of many offences unto justification.” Why, indeed, is the
judgment from one offence to condemnation, while the grace is from many offences to
justification? If original sin is a nullity, would it not follow, that not only grace withdraws
men from many offences to justification, but judgment leads them to condemnation from
many offences likewise? For assuredly grace does not condone many offences, without
judgment in like manner having many offences to condemn. Else, if men are involved in
condemnation because of one offence, on the ground that all the offences which are condemned
were committed in imitation of that one offence; there is the same reason why men
should also be regarded as withdrawn from one offence unto justification, inasmuch as all
the offences which are remitted to the justified were committed in imitation of that one offence.
But this most certainly was not the apostle’s meaning, when he said: “The judgment,
indeed, was from one offence unto condemnation, but the grace was from many offences
unto justification.” We on our side, indeed, can understand the apostle, and see that judgment
is predicated of one offence unto condemnation entirely on the ground that, even if there
were in men nothing but original sin, it would be sufficient for their condemnation. For
however much heavier will be their condemnation who have added their own sins to the
original offence (and it will be the more severe in individual cases, in proportion to the sins
of individuals); still, even that sin alone which was originally derived unto men not only
excludes from the kingdom of God, which infants are unable to enter (as they themselves
allow), unless they have received the grace of Christ before they die, but also alienates from
salvation and everlasting life, which cannot be anything else than the kingdom of God, to
which fellowship with Christ alone introduces us.</p>

<p>And from this we gather that we have derived from Adam, in whom we all have sinned,
not all our actual sins, but only original sin; whereas from Christ, in whom we are all justified,
we obtain the remission not merely of that original sin, but of the rest of our sins also, which
we have added. Hence it runs: “Not as by the one that sinned, so also is the free gift.” For
the judgment, certainly, from one sin, if it is not remitted—and that the original sin—is
capable of drawing us into condemnation; whilst grace conducts us to justification from the
remission of many sins,—that is to say, not simply from the original sin, but from all others
also whatsoever.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Whom Sinners Imitate.</head>
<p>“For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive
abundance of grace and of righteousness shall reign in life by one, even Jesus Christ.”260
Why did death reign on account of the sin of one, unless it was that men were bound by the
chain of death in that one man in whom all men sinned, even though they added no sins of
their own? Otherwise it was not on account of the sin of one that death reigned through
one; rather it was on account of the manifold offences of many, [operating] through each
individual sinner. For if the reason why men have died for the transgression of another be,
that they have imitated him by following him as their predecessor in transgression, it must
even result, and that “much more,” that that one died on account of the transgression of
another, whom the devil so preceded in transgression as himself to persuade him to commit
the transgression. Adam, however, used no influence to persuade his followers; and the
many who are said to have imitated him have, in fact, either not heard of his existence at
all or of his having committed any such sin as is ascribed to him, or altogether disbelieve it.
How much more correctly, therefore, as I have already remarked,261 would the apostle have
set forth the devil as the author, from which “one” he would say that sin and death had
passed upon all, if he had in this passage meant to speak, not of propagation, but of imitation?
For there is much stronger reason for saying that Adam is an imitator of the devil, since he
had in him an actual instigator to sin; if one may be an imitator even of him who has never
used any such persuasion, or of whom he is absolutely ignorant. But what is implied in the
clause, “They which receive abundance of grace and righteousness,” but that the grace of
remission is given not only to that sin in which all have sinned, but to those offences likewise
which men have actually committed besides; and that on these [men] so great a righteousness
is freely bestowed, that, although Adam gave way to him who persuaded him to sin, they
do not yield even to the coercion of the same tempter? Again, what mean the words, “Much
more shall they reign in life,” when the fact is, that the reign of death drags many more down
to eternal punishment, unless we understand those to be really mentioned in both clauses,
who pass from Adam to Christ, in other words, from death to life; because in the life eternal
they shall reign without end, and thus exceed the reign of death which has prevailed within
them only temporarily and with a termination?</p>

<p>“Therefore as by the offence of one upon all men to condemnation, even so by the justification
of One upon all men unto justification of life.”262 This “offence of one,” if we are
bent on “imitation,” can only be the devil’s offence. Since, however, it is manifestly spoken
in reference to Adam and not the devil, it follows that we have no other alternative than to
understand the principle of natural propagation, and not that of imitation, to be here implied.
<del>XIV.</del> Now when he says in reference to Christ, “By the justification of one,” he has more
expressly stated our doctrine than if he were to say, “By the righteousness of one;” inasmuch
as he mentions that justification whereby Christ justifies the ungodly, and which he did not
propose as an object of imitation, for He alone is capable of effecting this. Now it was quite
competent for the apostle to say, and to say rightly: “Be ye imitators of me, as I also am of
Christ;”263 but he could never say: Be ye justified by me, as I also am by Christ;—since there
may be, and indeed actually are and have been, many who were righteous and worthy of
imitation; but no one is righteous and a justifier but Christ alone. Whence it is said: “To the
man that believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”
264 Now if any man had it in his power confidently to declare, “I justify you,” it would
necessarily follow that he could also say, “Believe in me.” But it has never been in the power
of any of the saints of God to say this except the Saint of saints,265 who said: “Ye believe in
God, believe also in me;”266 so that, inasmuch as it is He that justifies the ungodly, to the
man who believes in him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is imputed for righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter 19 <del>XV.</del>—Sin is from Natural Descent, as Righteousness is from Regeneration;
How “All” Are Sinners Through Adam, and “All” Are Just Through Christ.</head>
<p>Now if it is imitation only that makes men sinners through Adam, why does not imitation
likewise alone make men righteous through Christ? “For,” he says, “as by the offence of one
upon all men to condemnation; even so by the justification of one upon all men unto justification
of life.”267 [On the theory of imitation], then, the “one” and the “one,” here, must
not be regarded as Adam and Christ, but Adam and Abel. For although many sinners have
preceded us in the time of this present life, and have been imitated in their sin by those who
have sinned at a later date, yet they will have it, that only Adam is mentioned as he in whom
all have sinned by imitation, since he was the first of men who sinned. And on the same
principle, Abel ought certainly to have been mentioned, as he “in which one” all likewise
are justified by imitation, inasmuch as he was himself the first man who lived justly. If,
however, it be thought necessary to take into the account some critical period having relation
to the beginning of the New Testament, and Christ be taken as the leader of the righteous
and the object of their imitation, then Judas, who betrayed Him, ought to be set down as
the leader of the class of sinners. Moreover, if Christ alone is He in whom all men are justified,
on the ground that it is not simply the imitation of His example which makes men just, but
His grace which regenerates men by the Spirit, then also Adam is the only one in whom all
have sinned, on the ground that it is not the mere following of his evil example that makes
men sinners, but the penalty which generates through the flesh. Hence the terms “all men”
and “all men.” For not they who are generated through Adam are actually the very same as
those who are regenerated through Christ; but yet the language of the apostle is strictly
correct, because as none partakes of carnal generation except through Adam, so no one
shares in the spiritual except through Christ. For if any could be generated in the flesh, yet
not by Adam; and if in like manner any could be generated in the Spirit, and not by Christ;
clearly “all” could not be spoken of either in the one class or in the other. But these “all”268
the apostle afterwards describes as “many;”269 for obviously, under certain circumstances,
the “all” may be but a few. The carnal generation, however, embraces “many,” and the
spiritual generation also includes “many;” although the “many” of the spiritual are less numerous
than the “many” of the carnal. But as the one embraces all men whatever, so the
other includes all righteous men; because as in the former case none can be a man without
the carnal generation, so in the other class no one can be a righteous man without the spiritual
generation; in both instances, therefore, there are “many:” “For as by the disobedience

<head>Chapter 20.—Original Sin Alone is Contracted by Natural Birth.</head>
<p>“Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound.”271 This addition to original
sin men now made of their own wilfulness, not through Adam; but even this is done away
and remedied by Christ, because “where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; that
as sin hath reigned unto death”272—even that sin which men have not derived from Adam,
but have added of their own will—“even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
eternal life.”273 There is, however, other righteousness apart from Christ, as there are other
sins apart from Adam. Therefore, after saying, “As sin hath reigned unto death,” he did not
add in the same clause “by one,” or “by Adam,” because he had already spoken of that sin
which was abounding when the law entered, and which, of course, was not original sin, but
the sin of man’s own wilful commission. But after he has said: “Even so might grace also
reign through righteousness unto eternal life,” he at once adds, “through Jesus Christ our
Lord;”274 because, whilst by the generation of the flesh only that sin is contracted which is
original; yet by the regeneration of the Spirit there is effected the remission not of original
sin only, but also of the sins of man’s own voluntary and actual commission.</p>

<head>Chapter 21 <del>XVI.</del>—Unbaptized Infants Damned, But Most Lightly;275 The Penalty
of Adam’s Sin, the Grace of His Body Lost.</head>
<p>It may therefore be correctly affirmed, that such infants as quit the body without being
baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, greatly
deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation;
whereas the apostle says: “Judgment from one offence to condemnation,”276 and again a
little after: “By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation.”277 When, indeed,
Adam sinned by not obeying God, then his body—although it was a natural and mortal
body—lost the grace whereby it used in every part of it to be obedient to the soul. Then
there arose in men affections common to the brutes which are productive of shame, and
which made man ashamed of his own nakedness.278 Then also, by a certain disease which
was conceived in men from a suddenly injected and pestilential corruption, it was brought
about that they lost that stability of life in which they were created, and, by reason of the
mutations which they experienced in the stages of life, issued at last in death. However many
were the years they lived in their subsequent life, yet they began to die on the day when they
received the law of death, because they kept verging towards old age. For that possesses not
even a moment’s stability, but glides away without intermission, which by constant change
perceptibly advances to an end which does not produce perfection, but utter exhaustion.
Thus, then, was fulfilled what God had spoken: “In the day that ye eat thereof, ye shall surely
die.”279 As a consequence, then, of this disobedience of the flesh and this law of sin and
death, whoever is born of the flesh has need of spiritual regeneration—not only that he may
reach the kingdom of God, but also that he may be freed from the damnation of sin. Hence
men are on the one hand born in the flesh liable to sin and death from the first Adam, and
on the other hand are born again in baptism associated with the righteousness and eternal
life of the second Adam; even as it is written in the book of Ecclesiasticus: “Of the woman
came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die.”280 Now whether it be said of the
woman or of Adam, both statements pertain to the first man; since (as we know) the woman
is of the man, and the two are one flesh. Whence also it is written: “And they twain shall be
one flesh; wherefore,” the Lord says, “they are no more twain, but one flesh.”281</p>

<head>Chapter 22 <del>XVII.</del>—To Infants Personal Sin is Not to Be Attributed.</head>
<p>They, therefore, who say that the reason why infants are baptized, is, that they may have
the remission of the sin which they have themselves committed in their life, not what they
have derived from Adam, may be refuted without much difficulty. For whenever these
persons shall have reflected within themselves a little, uninfluenced by any polemical spirit,
on the absurdity of their statement, how unworthy it is, in fact, of serious discussion, they
will at once change their opinion. But if they will not do this, we shall not so completely
despair of men’s common sense, as to have any fears that they will induce others to adopt
their views. They are themselves driven to adopt their opinion, if I am not mistaken, by their
prejudice for some other theory; and it is because they feel themselves obliged to allow that
sins are remitted to the baptized, and are unwilling to allow that the sin was derived from
Adam which they admit to be remitted to infants, that they have been obliged to charge infancy
itself with actual sin; as if by bringing this charge against infancy a man could become
the more secure himself, when accused and unable to answer his assailant! However, let us,
as I suggested, pass by such opponents as these; indeed, we require neither words nor quotations
of Scripture to prove the sinlessness of infants, so far as their conduct in life is concerned;
this life they spend, such is the recency of their birth, within their very selves, since
it escapes the cognizance of human perception, which has no data or support whereon to
sustain any controversy on the subject.</p>

<head>Chapter 23 <del>XVIII.</del>—He Refutes Those Who Allege that Infants are Baptized Not
for the Remission of Sins, But for the Obtaining of the Kingdom of Heaven.282</head>
<p>But those persons raise a question, and appear to adduce an argument deserving of
consideration and discussion, who say that new-born infants receive baptism not for the
remission of sin, but that, since their procreation is not spiritual, they may be created in
Christ, and become partakers of the kingdom of heaven, and by the same means children
and heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ. And yet, when you ask them, whether those
that are not baptized, and are not made joint-heirs with Christ and partakers of the kingdom
of heaven, have at any rate the blessing of eternal life in the resurrection of the dead, they
are extremely perplexed, and find no way out of their difficulty. For what Christian is there
who would allow it to be said, that any one could attain to eternal salvation without being
born again in Christ,—[a result] which He meant to be effected through baptism, at the very
time when such a sacrament was purposely instituted for regenerating in the hope of
eternal salvation? Whence the apostle says: “Not by works of righteousness which we have
done, but according to His mercy He saved us by the laver283 of regeneration.”284 This salvation,
however, he says, consists in hope, while we live here below, where he says, “For we
are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet
hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.”285 Who
then could be so bold as to affirm, that without the regeneration of which the apostle speaks,
infants could attain to eternal salvation, as if Christ died not for them? For “Christ died for
the ungodly.”286 As for them, however, who (as is manifest) never did an ungodly act in all
their own life, if also they are not bound by any bond of sin in their original nature, how
did He die for them, who died for the ungodly? If they were hurt by no malady of original
sin, how is it they are carried to the Physician Christ, for the express purpose of receiving
the sacrament of eternal salvation, by the pious anxiety of those who run to Him? Why
rather is it not said to them in the Church: Take hence these innocents: “they that are whole
need not a physician, but they that are sick;”—Christ “came not to call the righteous, but
sinners?”287 There never has been heard, there never is heard, there never will be heard in
the Church, such a fiction concerning Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 24 <del>XIX.</del>—Infants Saved as Sinners.</head>
<p>And let no one suppose that infants ought to be brought to baptism, on the ground that,
as they are not sinners, so they are not righteous; how then do some remind us that the Lord
commends this tender age as meritorious; saying, “Suffer the little children to come unto
me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven?”288 For if this [“of such”]
is not said because of likeness in humility (since humility makes [us] children), but because
of the laudable life of children, then of course infants must be righteous persons; otherwise,
it could not be correctly said, “Of such is the kingdom of heaven,” for heaven can only belong
to the righteous. But perhaps, after all, it is not a right opinion of the meaning of the Lord’s
words, to make Him commend the life of infants when He says, “Of such is the kingdom
of heaven;” inasmuch as that may be their true sense, which makes Christ adduce the tender
age of infancy as a likeness of humility. Even so, however, perhaps we must revert to the
tenet which I mentioned just now, that infants ought to be baptized, because, although they
are not sinners, they are yet not righteous. But when He had said: “I came not to call the
righteous,” as if responding to this, Whom, then, didst Thou come to call? immediately He
goes on to say: “—but sinners to repentance.” Therefore it follows, that, however righteous
they may be, if also they are not sinners, He came not to call them, who said of Himself: “I
came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” They therefore seem, not vainly only, but even
wickedly to rush to the baptism of Him who does not invite them,—an opinion which God
forbid that we should entertain. He calls them, then, as a Physician who is not needed for
those that are whole, but for those that are sick; and who came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance. Now, inasmuch as infants are not held bound by any sins of their
own actual life, it is the guilt of original sin which is healed in them by the grace of Him
who saves them by the laver of regeneration.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Infants are Described as Believers and as Penitents. Sins Alone Separate
Between God and Men.</head>
<p>Some one will say: How then are mere infants called to repentance? How can such as
they repent of anything? The answer to this is: If they must not be called penitents because
they have not the sense of repenting, neither must they be called believers, because they
likewise have not the sense of believing. But if they are rightly called believers,289 because
they in a certain sense profess faith by the words of their parents, why are they not also held
to be before that penitents when they are shown to renounce the devil and this world by the
profession again of the same parents? The whole of this is done in hope, in the strength of
the sacrament and of the divine grace which the Lord has bestowed upon the Church. But
yet who knows not that the baptized infant fails to be benefited from what he received as a
little child, if on coming to years of reason he fails to believe and to abstain from unlawful
desires? If, however, the infant departs from the present life after he has received baptism,
the guilt in which he was involved by original sin being done away, he shall be made perfect
in that light of truth, which, remaining unchangeable for evermore, illumines the justified
in the presence of their Creator. For sins alone separate between men and God; and these
are done away by Christ’s grace, through whom, as Mediator, we are reconciled, when He
justifies the ungodly.</p>

<head>Chapter 26 <del>XX.</del>—No One, Except He Be Baptized, Rightly Comes to the Table of
the Lord.</head>
<p>Now they take alarm from the statement of the Lord, when He says, “Except a man be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God;”290 because in His own explanation of the
passage He affirms, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God.”291 And so they try to ascribe to unbaptized infants, by the merit of
their innocence, the gift of salvation and eternal life, but at the same time, owing to their
being unbaptized, to exclude them from the kingdom of heaven. But how novel and astonishing
is such an assumption, as if there could possibly be salvation and eternal life without
heirship with Christ, without the kingdom of heaven! Of course they have their refuge,
whither to escape and hide themselves, because the Lord does not say, Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot have life, but—“he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.” If indeed He had said the other, there could have risen not a moment’s doubt. Well,
then, let us remove the doubt; let us now listen to the Lord, and not to men’s notions and
conjectures; let us, I say, hear what the Lord says—not indeed concerning the sacrament of
the laver, but concerning the sacrament of His own holy table, to which none but a baptized
person has a right to approach: “Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood, ye shall have
no life in you.”292 What do we want more? What answer to this can be adduced, unless it
be by that obstinacy which ever resists the constancy of manifest truth?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Infants Must Feed on Christ.</head>
<p>Will, however, any man be so bold as to say that this statement has no relation to infants,
and that they can have life in them without partaking of His body and blood—on the ground
that He does not say, Except one eat, but “Except ye eat;” as if He were addressing those who
were able to hear and to understand, which of course infants cannot do? But he who says
this is inattentive; because, unless all are embraced in the statement, that without the body
and the blood of the Son of man men cannot have life, it is to no purpose that even the elder
age is solicitous of it. For if you attend to the mere words, and not to the meaning, of the
Lord as He speaks, this passage may very well seem to have been spoken merely to the people
whom He happened at the moment to be addressing; because He does not say, Except one
eat; but Except ye eat. What also becomes of the statement which He makes in the same
context on this very point: “The bread that I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world?”293
For, it is according to this statement, that we find that sacrament pertains also to us, who
were not in existence at the time the Lord spoke these words; for we cannot possibly say
that we do not belong to “the world,” for the life of which Christ gave His flesh. Who indeed
can doubt that in the term world all persons are indicated who enter the world by being
born? For, as He says in another passage, “The children of this world beget and are begotten.”
294 From all this it follows, that even for the life of infants was His flesh given, which He
gave for the life of the world; and that even they will not have life if they eat not the flesh of
the Son of man.</p>

classes must we place infants—amongst those who believe on the Son, or amongst those
who believe not the Son? In neither, say some, because, as they are not yet able to believe,
so must they not be deemed unbelievers. This, however, the rule of the Church does not
indicate, for it joins baptized infants to the number of the faithful. Now if they who are
baptized are, by virtue of the excellence and administration of so great a sacrament, nevertheless
reckoned in the number of the faithful, although by their own heart and mouth they
do not literally perform what appertains to the action of faith and confession; surely they
who have lacked the sacrament must be classed amongst those who do not believe on the
Son, and therefore, if they shall depart this life without this grace, they will have to encounter
what is written concerning such—they shall not have life, but the wrath of God abideth on
them. Whence could this result to those who clearly have no sins of their own, if they are
not held to be obnoxious to original sin?</p>

<head>Chapter 29 <del>XXI.</del>—It is an Inscrutable Mystery Why Some are Saved, and Others
Not.</head>
<p>Now there is much significance in that He does not say, “The wrath of God shall come
upon him,” but “abideth on him.” For from this wrath (in which we are all involved under
sin, and of which the apostle says, “For we too were once by nature the children of wrath,
even as others”296) nothing delivers us but the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
The reason why this grace comes upon one man and not on another may be hidden, but it
cannot be unjust. For “is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.”297 But we must
first bend our necks to the authority of the Holy Scriptures, in order that we may each arrive
at knowledge and understanding through faith. For it is not said in vain, “Thy judgments
are a great deep.”298 The profundity of this “deep” the apostle, as if with a feeling of dread,
notices in that exclamation: “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge
of God!” He had indeed previously pointed out the meaning of this marvellous depth, when
he said: “For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon
all.”299 Then struck, as it were, with a horrible fear of this deep: “O the depth of the riches
both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and
His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been
His counsellor?or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.
Amen.”300 How utterly insignificant, then, is our faculty for discussing the justice of God’s
judgments, and for the consideration of His gratuitous grace, which, as men have no prevenient
merits for deserving it, cannot be partial or unrighteous, and which does not disturb
us when it is bestowed upon unworthy men, as much as when it is denied to those who are
equally unworthy!</p>

<p>Now those very persons, who think it unjust that infants which depart this life without
the grace of Christ should be deprived not only of the kingdom of God, into which they
themselves admit that none but such as are regenerated through baptism can enter, but also
of eternal life and salvation,—when they ask how it can be just that one man should be freed
from original sin and another not, although the condition of both of them is the same, might
answer their own question, in accordance with their own opinion of how it can be so frequently
just and right that one should have baptism administered to him whereby to enter
into the kingdom of God, and another not be so favoured, although the case of both is alike.
For if the question disturbs him, why, of the two persons, who are both equally sinners by
nature, the one is loosed from that bond, on whom baptism is conferred, and the other is
not released, on whom such grace is not bestowed; why is he not similarly disturbed by the
fact that of two persons, innocent by nature, one receives baptism, whereby he is able to
enter into the kingdom of God, and the other does not receive it, so that he is incapable of
approaching the kingdom of God? Now in both cases one recurs to the apostle’s outburst
of wonder “O the depth of the riches!” Again, let me be informed, why out of the body of
baptized infants themselves, one is taken away, so that his understanding undergoes no
change from a wicked life, 301 and the other survives, destined to become an impious man?
Suppose both were carried off, would not both enter the kingdom of heaven? And yet there
is no unrighteousness with God.302 How is it that no one is moved, no one is driven to the
expression of wonder amidst such depths, by the circumstance that some children are vexed
by the unclean spirit, while others experience no such pollution, and others again, as
Jeremiah, are sanctified even in their mother’s womb;303 whereas all men, if there is original
sin, are equally guilty; or else equally innocent if there is original sin? Whence this great diversity,
except in the fact that God’s judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding
out?</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the now exploded and rejected opinion must be resumed, that souls
which once sinned in their heavenly abode, descend by stages and degrees to bodies suited
to their deserts, and, as a penalty for their previous life, are more or less tormented by corporeal
chastisements. To this opinion Holy Scripture indeed presents a most manifest contradiction;
for when recommending divine grace, it says: “For the children being not yet
born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said, The elder shall serve the
younger.”304 And yet they who entertain such an opinion are actually unable to escape the
perplexities of this question, but, embarrassed and straitened by them, are compelled to
exclaim like others, “O the depth!” For whence does it come to pass that a person shall from
his earliest boyhood show greater moderation, mental excellence, and temperance, and shall
to a great extent conquer lust, shall hate avarice, detest luxury, and rise to a greater eminence
and aptitude in the other virtues, and yet live in such a place as to be unable to hear the
grace of Christ preached?—for “how shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?
or how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear
without a preacher?”305 While another man, although of a slow mind, addicted to lust, and
covered with disgrace and crime, shall be so directed as to hear, and believe, and be baptized,
and be taken away,—or, if permitted to remain longer here, lead the rest of his life in a
manner that shall bring him praise? Now where did these two persons acquire such diverse
deserts,—I do not say, that the one should believe and the other not believe, for that is a
matter for a man’s own will; but that the one should hear in order to believe, and that the
other should not hear, for this is not within man’s power? Where, I say, did they acquire
diverse deserts? If they had indeed passed any part of their life in heaven, so as to be thrust
down, or to sink down, to this world, and to tenant such bodily receptacles as are congruous
to their own former life, then of course that man ought to be supposed to have led the better
life previous to his present mortal body, who did not much deserve to be burdened with it,
so as both to have a good disposition, and to be importuned by milder desires which he
could easily overcome; and yet he did not deserve to have that grace preached to him whereby
alone he could be delivered from the ruin of the second death. Whereas the other, who was
hampered with a grosser body, as a penalty—so they suppose—for worse deserts, and was
accordingly possessed of obtuser affections, whilst he was in the violent ardour of his lust
succumbing to the snares of the flesh, and by his wicked life aggravating his former sins,

which had brought him to such a pass, by a still more abandoned course of earthly pleasures,—
either heard upon the cross, “To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise,”306 or else
joined himself to some apostle, by whose preaching he became a changed man, and was
saved by the washing of regeneration,—so that where sin once abounded, grace did much
more abound. I am at a loss to know what answer they can give to this who wish to maintain
God’s righteousness by human conjectures, and, knowing nothing of the depths of grace,
have woven webs of improbable fable.</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—The Case of Certain Idiots and Simpletons.</head>
<p>Now a good deal may be said of men’s strange vocations,—either such as we have read
about, or have experienced ourselves,—which go to overthrow the opinion of those persons
who think that, previous to the possession of their bodies, men’s souls passed through certain
lives peculiar to themselves, in which they must come to this, and experience in the present
life either good or evil, according to the difference of their individual deserts. My anxiety,
however, to bring this work to an end does not permit me to dwell longer on these topics.
But on one point, which among many I have found to be a very strange one, I will not be
silent. If we follow those persons who suppose that souls are oppressed with earthly bodies
in a greater or a less degree of grossness, according to the deserts of the life which had been
passed in celestial bodies previous to the assumption of the present one, who would not affirm
that those had sinned previous to this life with an especial amount of enormity, who deserve
so to lose all mental light, that they are born with faculties akin to brute animals,—who are
(I will not say most slow in intellect, for this is very commonly said of others also, but) so
silly as to make a show of their fatuity for the amusement of clever people, even with idiotic
gestures,307 and whom the vulgar call, by a name, derived from the Greek, Moriones?308And
yet there was once a certain person of this class, who was so Christian, that although he was
patient to the degree of strange folly with any amount of injury to himself, he was yet so
impatient of any insult to the name of Christ, or, in his own person, to the religion with
which he was imbued, that he could never refrain, whenever his gay and clever audience
proceeded to blaspheme the sacred name, as they sometimes would in order to provoke his
patience, from pelting them with stones; and on these occasions he would show no favour
even to persons of rank. Well, now, such persons are predestinated and brought into being,
as I suppose, in order that those who are able should understand that God’s grace and the
Spirit, “which bloweth where it listeth,”309 does not pass over any kind of capacity in the
sons of mercy, nor in like manner does it pass over any kind of capacity in the children of
Gehenna, so that “he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”310 They, however, who affirm
that souls severally receive different earthly bodies, more or less gross according to the
merits of their former life, and that their abilities as men vary according to the self-same
merits, so that some minds are sharper and others more obtuse, and that the grace of God

is also dispensed for the liberation of men from their sins according to the deserts of their
former existence:—what will they have to say about this man? How will they be able to attribute
to him a previous life of so disgraceful a character that he deserved to be born an
idiot, and at the same time of so highly meritorious a character as to entitle him to a preference
in the award of the grace of Christ over many men of the acutest intellect?</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—Christ is the Saviour and Redeemer Even of Infants.</head>
<p>Let us therefore give in and yield our assent to the authority of Holy Scripture, which
knows not how either to be deceived or to deceive; and as we do not believe that men as yet
unborn have done any good or evil for raising a difference in their moral deserts, so let us
by no means doubt that all men are under sin, which came into the world by one man and
has passed through unto all men; and from which nothing frees us but the grace of God
through our Lord Jesus Christ. <del>XXIII.</del> His remedial advent is needed by those that are sick,
not by the whole: for He came not to call the righteous, but sinners; and into His kingdom
shall enter no one that is not born again of water and the Spirit; nor shall any one attain
salvation and eternal life except in His kingdom,—since the man who believes not in the
Son, and eats not His flesh, shall not have life, but the wrath of God remains upon him. Now
from this sin, from this sickness, from this wrath of God (of which by nature they are children
who have original sin, even if they have none of their own on account of their youth), none
delivers them, except the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world;311 except the
Physician, who came not for the sake of the sound, but of the sick; except the Saviour, concerning
whom it was said to the human race: “Unto you there is born this day a Saviour;”312
except the Redeemer, by whose blood our debt is blotted out. For who would dare to say
that Christ is not the Saviour and Redeemer of infants? But from what does He save them,
if there is no malady of original sin within them? From what does He redeem them, if
through their origin from the first man they are not sold under sin? Let there be then no
eternal salvation promised to infants out of our own opinion, without Christ’s baptism; for
none is promised in that Holy Scripture which is to be preferred to all human authority and
opinion.</p>

<head>Chapter 34 <del>XXIV.</del>—Baptism is Called Salvation, and the Eucharist, Life, by the
Christians of Carthage.</head>
<p>The Christians of Carthage have an excellent name for the sacraments, when they say
that baptism is nothing else than “salvation,” and the sacrament of the body of Christ
nothing else than “life.” Whence, however, was this derived, but from that primitive, as I
suppose, and apostolic tradition, by which the Churches of Christ maintain it to be an inherent
principle, that without baptism and partaking of the supper of the Lord it is impossible
for any man to attain either to the kingdom of God or to salvation and everlasting life? So
much also does Scripture testify, according to the words which we already quoted. For
wherein does their opinion, who designate baptism by the term salvation, differ from what
is written: “He saved us by the washing of regeneration?”313 or from Peter’s statement: “The
like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us?”314 And what else do they say
who call the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper life, than that which is written: “I am the living
bread which came down from heaven;”315 and “The bread that I shall give is my flesh, for
the life of the world;”316 and “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood,
ye shall have no life in you?”317 If, therefore, as so many and such divine witnesses agree,
neither salvation nor eternal life can be hoped for by any man without baptism and the
Lord’s body and blood, it is vain to promise these blessings to infants without them.
Moreover, if it be only sins that separate man from salvation and eternal life, there is nothing
else in infants which these sacraments can be the means of removing, but the guilt of
sin,—respecting which guilty nature it is written, that “no one is clean, not even if his life
be only that of a day.”318 Whence also that exclamation of the Psalmist: “Behold, I was
shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me!”319 This is either said in the
person of our common humanity, or if of himself only David speaks, it does not imply that
he was born of fornication, but in lawful wedlock. We therefore ought not to doubt that
even for infants yet to be baptized was that precious blood shed, which previous to its actual
effusion was so given, and applied in the sacrament, that it was said, “This is my blood,
which shall be shed for many for the remission of sins.”320 Now they who will not allow

<head>Chapter 35.—Unless Infants are Baptized, They Remain in Darkness.</head>
<p>“I am come,” says Christ, “a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should
not abide in darkness.”321 Now what does this passage show us, but that every person is in
darkness who does not believe on Him, and that it is by believing on Him that he escapes
from this permanent state of darkness? What do we understand by the darkness but sin?
And whatever else it may embrace in its meaning, at any rate he who believes not in Christ
will “abide in darkness,”—which, of course, is a penal state, not, as the darkness of the night,
necessary for the refreshment of living beings. [XXV.] So that infants, unless they pass into
the number of believers through the sacrament which was divinely instituted for this purpose,
will undoubtedly remain in this darkness.</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—Infants Not Enlightened as Soon as They are Born.</head>
<p>Some, however, understand that as soon as children are born they are enlightened; and
they derive this opinion from the passage: “That was the true Light, which lighteth every
one that cometh into the world.”322 Well, if this be the case, it is quite astonishing how it
can be that those who are thus enlightened by the only-begotten Son, who was in the beginning
the Word with God, and [Himself] God, are not admitted into the kingdom of God,
nor are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. For that such an inheritance is not bestowed
upon them except through baptism, even they who hold the opinion in question do acknowledge.
Then, again, if they are (though already illuminated) thus unfit for entrance into the
kingdom of God, they at all events ought gladly to receive the baptism, by which they are
fitted for it; but, strange to say, we see how reluctant infants are to submit to baptism, resisting
even with strong crying. And this ignorance of theirs we think lightly of at their time of life,
so that we fully administer the sacraments, which we know to be serviceable to them, even
although they struggle against them. And why, too, does the apostle say, “Be not children
in understanding,”323 if their minds have been already enlightened with that true Light,
which is the Word of God?</p>

<p>That statement, therefore, which occurs in the gospel, “That was the true Light, which
lighteth every one that cometh into the world,”324 has this meaning, that no man is illuminated
except with that Light of the truth, which is God; so that no person must think that he
is enlightened by him whom he listens to as a learner, although that instructor happen to
be—I will not say, any great man—but even an angel himself. For the word of truth is applied
to man externally by the ministry of a bodily voice, but yet “neither is he that planteth any
thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.” 325 Man indeed hears the
speaker, be he man or angel, but in order that he may perceive and know that what is said
is true, his mind is internally besprinkled with that light which remains for ever, and which
shines even in darkness. But just as the sun is not seen by the blind, though they are clothed
as it were with its rays, so is the light of truth not understood by the darkness of folly.</p>

<head>Chapter 38.—What “Lighteth” Means.</head>
<p>But why, after saying, “which lighteth every man,” should he add, “that cometh into the
world,”326—the clause which has suggested the opinion that He enlightens the minds of
newly-born babes while the birth of their bodies from their mother’s womb is still a recent
thing? The words, no doubt, are so placed in the Greek, that they may be understood to
express that the light itself “cometh into the world.”327 If, nevertheless, the clause must be
taken as expressing the man who cometh into this world, I suppose that it is either a simple
phrase, like many others one finds in the Scriptures, which may be removed without impairing
the general sense; or else, if it is to be regarded as a distinctive addition, it was perhaps
inserted in order to distinguish spiritual illumination from that bodily one which enlightens
the eyes of the flesh either by means of the luminaries of the sky, or by the lights of ordinary
fire. So that he mentioned the inner man as coming into the world, because the outward
man is of a corporeal nature, just as this world itself; as if he said, “Which lighteth every
man that cometh into the body,” in accordance with that which is written: “I obtained a
good spirit, and I came in a body undefiled.”328 Or again, the passage, “Which lighteth every
one that cometh into the world,”—if it was added for the sake of expressing some distinction,—
might perhaps mean: Which lighteth every inner man, because the inner man, when
he becomes truly wise, is enlightened only by Him who is the true Light. Or, once more, if
the intention was to designate reason herself, which causes the human soul to be called ra-
tional (and this reason, although as yet quiet and as it were asleep, for all that lies hidden in
infants, innate and, so to speak, implanted), by the term illumination, as if it were the creation
of an inner eye, then it cannot be denied that it is made when the soul is created; and there
is no absurdity in supposing this to take place when the human being comes into the world.
But yet, although his eye is now created, he himself must needs remain in darkness, if he
does not believe in Him who said: “I am come a Light into the world, that whosoever believeth
on me should not abide in darkness.”329 And that this takes place in the case of infants,
through the sacrament of baptism, is not doubted by mother Church, which uses for them
the heart and mouth of a mother, that they may be imbued with the sacred mysteries, seeing
that they cannot as yet with their own heart “believe unto righteousness,” nor with their
own mouth make “confession unto salvation.”330 There is not indeed a man among the
faithful, who would hesitate to call such infants believers merely from the circumstance that

<head>Chapter 39 <del>XXVI.</del>—The Conclusion Drawn, that All are Involved in Original Sin.</head>
<p>It would be tedious, were we fully to discuss, at similar length, every testimony bearing
on the question. I suppose it will be the more convenient course simply to collect the passages
together which may turn up, or such as shall seem sufficient for manifesting the truth, that
the Lord Jesus Christ came in the flesh, and, in the form of a servant, became obedient even
to the death of the cross,331 for no other reason than, by this dispensation of His most
merciful grace, to give life to all those to whom, as engrafted members of His body, He becomes
Head for laying hold upon the kingdom of heaven: to save, free, redeem, and enlighten
them,—who had aforetime been involved in the death, infirmities, servitude, captivity, and
darkness of sin, under the dominion of the devil, the author of sin: and thus to become the
Mediator between God and man, by whom (after the enmity of our ungodly condition had
been terminated by His gracious help) we might be reconciled to God unto eternal life,
having been rescued from the eternal death which threatened such as us. When this shall
have been made clear by more than sufficient evidence, it will follow that those persons
cannot be concerned with that dispensation of Christ which is executed by His humiliation,
who have no need of life, and salvation, and deliverance, and redemption, and illumination.
And inasmuch as to this belongs baptism, in which we are buried with Christ, in order to
be incorporated into Him as His members (that is, as those who believe in Him): it of course
follows that baptism is unnecessary for them, who have no need of the benefit of that forgiveness
and reconciliation which is acquired through a Mediator. Now, seeing that they
admit the necessity of baptizing infants,—finding themselves unable to contravene that
authority of the universal Church, which has been unquestionably handed down by the
Lord and His apostles,—they cannot avoid the further concession, that infants require the
same benefits of the Mediator, in order that, being washed by the sacrament and charity of
the faithful, and thereby incorporated into the body of Christ, which is the Church, they
may be reconciled to God, and so live in Him, and be saved, and delivered, and redeemed,
and enlightened. But from what, if not from death, and the vices, and guilt, and thraldom,
and darkness of sin? And, inasmuch as they do not commit any sin in the tender age of infancy
by their actual transgression, original sin only is left.</p>

<head>Chapter 40 <del>XXVII.</del>—A Collection of Scripture Testimonies. From the Gospels.</head>
<p>This reasoning will carry more weight, after I have collected the mass of Scripture
testimonies which I have undertaken to adduce. We have already quoted: “I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners.”332 To the same purport [the Lord] says, on entering the
home of Zaccheus: “To-day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son
of Abraham; for the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.”333 The
same truth is declared in the parable of the lost sheep and the ninety and nine which were
left until the missing one was sought and found;334 as it is also in the parable of the lost one
among the ten silver coins.335 Whence, as He said, “it behoved that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”336 Mark
likewise, at the end of his Gospel, tells us how that the Lord said: “Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved;
but he that believeth not shall be damned.”337 Now, who can be unaware that, in the case
of infants, being baptized is to believe, and not being baptized is not to believe? From the
Gospel of John we have already adduced some passages. However, I must also request your
attention to the following: John Baptist says of Christ, “Behold the Lamb of God, Behold
Him which taketh away the sin of the world;”338 and He too says of Himself, “My sheep
hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and
they shall never perish.”339 Now, inasmuch as infants are only able to become His sheep by
baptism, it must needs come to pass that they perish if they are not baptized, because they
will not have that eternal life which He gives to His sheep. So in another passage He says:
“I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”340</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—From the First Epistle of Peter.</head>
<p>See with what earnestness the apostles declare this doctrine, when they received it. Peter,
in his first Epistle, says: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, according
to His abundant mercy, who hath regenerated us unto the hope of eternal life, by the resurrection
of Jesus Christ, to an inheritance immortal, and undefiled, flourishing, reserved in
heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be
revealed in the last time.”341 And a little afterwards he adds: “May ye be found unto the
praise and honour of Jesus Christ: of whom ye were ignorant; but in whom ye believe, though
now ye see Him not; and in whom also ye shall rejoice, when ye shall see Him, with joy unspeakable
and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
souls.”342 Again, in another place he says: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath
called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.”343 Once more he says: “Christ hath
once suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God:”344 and,
after mentioning the fact of eight persons having been saved in Noah’s ark, he adds: “And
by the like figure baptism saveth you.”345 Now infants are strangers to this salvation and
light, and will remain in perdition and darkness, unless they are joined to the people of God
by adoption, holding to Christ who suffered the just for the unjust, to bring them unto God.</p>

<p>Moreover, from John’s Epistle I meet with the following words, which seem indispensable
to the solution of this question: “But if,” says he, “we walk in the light, as He is in the light,
we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us
from all sin.”346 To the like import he says, in another place: “If we receive the witness of
men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God, which is greater because
He hath testified of His Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself:
he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; because he believed not in the testimony
that God testified of His Son. And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal
life; and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
of God hath not life.”347 It seems, then, that it is not only the kingdom of heaven, but life
also, which infants are not to have, if they have not the Son, whom they can only have by
His baptism. So again he says: “For this cause the Son of God was manifested, that He might
destroy the works of the devil.”348 Therefore infants will have no interest in the manifestation
of the Son of God, if He do not in them destroy the works of the devil.</p>

<head>Chapter 43.—From the Epistle to the Romans.</head>
<p>Let me now request your attention to the testimony of the Apostle Paul on this subject.
And quotations from him may of course be made more abundantly, because he wrote more
epistles, and because it fell to him to recommend the grace of God with especial earnestness,
in opposition to those who gloried in their works, and who, ignorant of God’s righteousness,
and wishing to establish their own, submitted not to the righteousness of God.349 In his
Epistle to the Romans he writes: “The righteousness of God is upon all them that believe;
for there is no difference; since all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being
justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath
set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the
remission350 of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this
time His righteousness; that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
Jesus.”351 Then in another passage he says: “To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned
of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the
ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also describeth the blessedness
of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom

written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be
imputed, if we believe on Him that raised up Jesus Christ our Lord from the dead; who was
delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.”353 Then a little after
he writes: “For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.”
354 In another passage he says: “We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal,
sold under sin. For that which I do I know not: for what I would, that I do not; but what I
hate, that I do. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that
is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing; for to will is present with me; but how to perform
that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would
not, that I do. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth

grace through Jesus Christ in order to be delivered from the body of this death. Therefore

the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh.”356 Let them say, who dare, that Christ must have been born in the likeness

<p>Likewise to the Corinthians he says: “For I delivered to you first of all that which I also
received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.”357 Again, in his
Second Epistle to these Corinthians: “For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we
thus judge, that if One died for all, then all died: and for all did Christ die, that they which
live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them, and rose
again. Wherefore, henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known
Christ after the flesh, yet from henceforth know we Him so no more. Therefore if any man
be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and hath
given unto us the ministry of reconciliation. To what effect? That God was in Christ, reconciling
the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and putting on us
the ministry of reconciliation. Now then are we ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, to be reconciled to God. For He hath made
Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might become the righteousness of God in
Him.358 We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive not the
grace of God in vain. (For He saith, I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in the day
of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the
day of salvation.)”359 Now, if infants are not embraced within this reconciliation and salvation,
who wants them for the baptism of Christ? But if they are embraced, then are they
reckoned as among the dead for whom He died; nor can they be possibly reconciled and
saved by Him, unless He remit and impute not unto them their sins.</p>

one party; but God is one. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if

in trespasses and sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit of him that now worketh in the
children of disobedience; among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature
the children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love
wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
Christ; by whose grace ye are saved.”362 Again, a little afterwards, he says: “By grace are ye
saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any
man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”363 And again, after a short
interval: “At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
but now, in Christ Jesus, ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
For He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of
partition between us; having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments
contained in ordinances; for to make in Himself of twain one new man, so making
peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having in
Himself slain the enmity; and He came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and
to them that were nigh. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.”
364 Then in another passage he thus writes: “As the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off,
concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which
after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.”365 And again: “Grieve not the Holy

<head>Chapter 50.—From the Epistle to the Hebrews.</head>
<p>Although the authority of the Epistle to the Hebrews is doubted by some,376 nevertheless,
as I find it sometimes thought by persons, who oppose our opinion touching the baptism
of infants, to contain evidence in favour of their own views, we shall notice the pointed
testimony it bears in our behalf; and I quote it the more confidently, because of the authority
of the Eastern Churches, which expressly place it amongst the canonical Scriptures. In its
very exordium one thus reads: “God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in
time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by His Son,
whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds; who, being
the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person, and upholding all things
by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high.”377 And by and by the writer says: “For if the word spoken by
angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense
of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?”378 And again in another
passage: “Forasmuch then,” says he, “as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He
also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that
had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were
all their lifetime subject to bondage.”379 Again, shortly after, he says: “Wherefore in all
things it behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and
faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people.”380 And in another place he writes: “Let us hold fast our profession. For we have
not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”381 Again he says: “He hath an unchangeable
priesthood. Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God
by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them. For such a High Priest became

sins, and then for the people’s: for this He did once, when He offered up Himself.”382 And
once more: “For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the
figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: nor
yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every
year with blood of others; (for then must He often have suffered since the foundation of the
world;) but now once, in the end of the world, hath He appeared to put away sin by the
sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment;

He appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation.”383</p>

<p>Under so great a weight of testimony, who would not be oppressed that should dare lift
up his voice against the truth of God? And many other testimonies might be found, were it
not for my anxiety to bring this tract to an end,—an anxiety which I must not slight. I have
deemed it superfluous to quote from the books of the Old Testament, likewise, many attestations
to our doctrine in inspired words, since what is concealed in them under the veil of
earthly promises is clearly revealed in the preaching of the New Testament. Our Lord
Himself briefly demonstrated and defined the use of the Old Testament writings, when He
said that it was necessary that what had been written concerning Himself in the Law, and
the Prophets, and the Psalms, should be fulfilled, and that this was that Christ must suffer,
and rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 390 In agreement with
this is that statement of Peter which I have already quoted, how that all the prophets bear
witness to Christ, that at His hands every one that believes in Him receives remission of his
sins.391</p>

<head>Chapter 54.—By the Sacrifices of the Old Testament, Men Were Convinced of Sins
and Led to the Saviour.</head>
<p>And yet it is perhaps better to advance a few testimonies out of the Old Testament also,
which ought to have a supplementary, or rather a cumulative value. The Lord Himself,
speaking by the Psalmist, says: “As for my saints which are upon earth, He hath caused all
my purposes to be admired in them.”392 Not their merits, but “my purposes.” For what is
theirs except that which is afterwards mentioned,—“their weaknesses are multiplied,”
393—above the weakness that they had? Moreover, the law also entered, that the offence
might abound. But why does the Psalmist immediately add: “They hastened after?”394 When
their sorrows and infirmities multiplied (that is, when their offence abounded), they then
sought the Physician more eagerly, in order that, where sin abounded, grace might much
more abound. He then says: “I will not gather their assemblies together [with their offerings]
of blood;” for by their many sacrifices of blood, when they gathered their assemblies into
the tabernacle at first, and then into the temple, they were rather convicted as sinners than
cleansed. I shall no longer, He says, gather their assemblies of blood-offerings together; because
there is one blood-shedding given for many, whereby they may be truly cleansed.
Then it follows: “Neither will I make mention of their names with my lips,” as if they were
the names of renewed ones. For these were their names at first: children of the flesh, children
of the world, children of wrath, children of the devil, unclean, sinners, impious; but afterwards,
children of God,—a new name to the new man, a new song to the singer of what is
new, by means of the New Testament. Men must not be ungracious with God’s grace, mean
with great things; [but be ever rising] from the less to the greater. The cry of the whole
Church is, “I have gone astray like a lost sheep.”395 From all the members of Christ the voice
is heard: “All we, as sheep, have gone astray; and He hath Himself been delivered up for our
sins.”396 The whole of this passage of prophecy is that famous one in Isaiah which was expounded
by Philip to the eunuch of Queen Candace, and he believed in Jesus.397 See how
often he commends this very subject, and, as it were, inculcates it again and again on proud
and contentious men: “He was a man under misfortune, and one who well knows to bear
infirmities; wherefore also He turned away His face, He was dishonoured, and was not much
esteemed. He it is that bears our weaknesses, and for us is involved in pains: and we accounted
Him to be in pains, and in misfortune, and in punishment. But it was He who was wounded

for our sins, was weakened for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him;
and by His bruise we are healed. All we, as sheep, have gone astray; and the Lord delivered
Him up for our sins. And although He was evilly entreated, yet He opened not His mouth:
as a sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He
opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away: His generation
who shall declare? For His life shall be taken away from the earth, and for the iniquities of
my people was He led to death. Therefore I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich
for His death; because He did no iniquity, nor deceit with His mouth. The Lord is pleased
to purge Him from misfortune. If you could yourselves have given your soul on account of
your sins, ye should see a seed of a long life. And the Lord is pleased to rescue His soul from
pains, to show Him light, and to form it through His understanding; to justify the Just One,
who serves many well; and He shall Himself bear their sins. Therefore He shall inherit many,
and He shall divide the spoils of the mighty; and He was numbered amongst the transgressors;
and Himself bare the sins of many, and He was delivered for their iniquities.”398 Consider
also that passage of this same prophet which Christ actually declared to be fulfilled in
Himself, when He recited it in the synagogue, in discharging the function of the reader:399
“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me: to preach glad tidings to
the poor hath He sent me, that so I may refresh all who are broken-hearted,—to preach
deliverance to the captives, and to the blind sight.”400 Let us then all acknowledge Him; nor
should there be one exception among persons like ourselves, who wish to cleave to His body,
to enter through Him into the sheepfold, and to attain to that life and eternal salvation which
He has promised to His own.—Let us, I repeat, all of us acknowledge Him who did no sin,
who bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we might live with righteousness separate
from sins; by whose scars we are healed, when we were weak 401—like wandering sheep.</p>

<head>Chapter 55 <del>XXVIII.</del>—He Concludes that All Men Need the Death of Christ, that
They May Be Saved. Unbaptized Infants Will Be Involved in the Condemnation
of the Devil. How All Men Through Adam are Unto Condemnation; And
Through Christ Unto Justification. No One is Reconciled with God, Except
Through Christ.</head>
<p>In such circumstances, no man of those who have come to Christ by baptism has ever
been regarded, according to sound faith and the true doctrine, as excepted from the grace
of forgiveness of sins; nor has eternal life been ever thought possible to any man apart from
His kingdom. For this [eternal life] is ready to be revealed at the last time,402 that is, at the
resurrection of the dead who are reserved not for that eternal death which is called “the
second death,” but for the eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promises to His saints
and faithful servants. Now none who shall partake of this life shall be made alive except in
Christ, even as all die in Adam.403 For as none whatever, of all those who belong to the
generation according to the will of the flesh, die except in Adam, in whom all sinned; so,
out of these, none at all who are regenerated by the will of the Spirit are endowed with life
except in Christ, in whom all are justified. Because as through one all to condemnation, so
through One all to justification.404 Nor is there any middle place for any man, and so a man
can only be with the devil who is not with Christ. Accordingly, also the Lord Himself
(wishing to remove from the hearts of wrong-believers405 that vague and indefinite middle
condition, which some would provide for unbaptized infants,—as if, by reason of their innocence,
they were embraced in eternal life, but were not, because of their unbaptized state,
with Christ in His kingdom) uttered that definitive sentence of His, which shuts their mouths:
“He that is not with me is against me.”406 Take then the case of any infant you please: If he
is already in Christ, why is he baptized? If, however, as the Truth has it, he is baptized just
that he may be with Christ, it certainly follows that he who is not baptized is not with Christ;
and because he is not “with” Christ, he is “against” Christ; for He has pronounced His own
sentence, which is so explicit that we ought not, and indeed cannot, impair it or change it.
And how can he be “against” Christ, if not owing to sin? for it cannot possibly be from his
soul or his body, both of these being the creation of God. Now if it be owing to sin, what
sin can be found at such an age, except the ancient and original sin? Of course that sinful
flesh in which all are born to condemnation is one thing, and that Flesh which was made

“after the likeness of sinful flesh,” whereby also all are freed from condemnation, is another
thing. It is, however, by no means meant to be implied that all who are born in sinful flesh
are themselves actually cleansed by that Flesh which is “like” sinful flesh; “for all men have
not faith;”407 but that all who are born from the carnal union are born entirely of sinful
flesh, whilst all who are born from the spiritual union are cleansed only by the Flesh which
is in the likeness of sinful flesh. In other words, the former class are in Adam unto condemnation,
the latter are in Christ unto justification. This is as if we should say, for example,
that in such a city there is a certain midwife who delivers all; and in the same place there is
an expert teacher who instructs all. By all, in the one case, only those who are born can
possibly be understood; by all, in the other, only those who are taught: and it does not follow
that all who are born also receive the instruction. But it is obvious to every one, that in the
one case it is correctly said, “she delivers all,” since without her aid no one is born; and in
the other, it is rightly said, “he teaches all,” since without his tutoring, no one learns.</p>

<p>Taking into account all the inspired statements which I have quoted,—whether I regard
the value of each passage one by one, or combine their united testimony in an accumulated
witness or even include similar passages which I have not adduced,—there can be nothing
discovered, but that which the catholic Church holds, in her dutiful vigilance against all
profane novelties: that every man is separated from God, except those who are reconciled
to God through Christ the Mediator; and that no one can be separated from God, except
by sins, which alone cause separation; that there is, therefore, no reconciliation except by
the remission of sins, through the one grace of the most merciful Saviour,—through the
one sacrifice of the most veritable Priest; and that none who are born of the woman, that
trusted the serpent and so was corrupted through desire,408 are delivered from the body of
this death, except by the Son of the virgin who believed the angel and so conceived without
desire.409</p>

<head>Chapter 57 <del>XXIX.</del>—The Good of Marriage; Four Different Cases of the Good and
the Evil Use of Matrimony.</head>
<p>The good, then, of marriage lies not in the passion of desire, but in a certain legitimate
and honourable measure in using that passion, appropriate to the propagation of children,
not the gratification of lust.410 That, therefore, which is disobediently excited in the members
of the body of this death, and endeavours to draw into itself our whole fallen soul, (neither
arising nor subsiding at the bidding of the mind), is that evil of sin in which every man is
born. When, however, it is curbed from unlawful desires, and is permitted only for the orderly
propagation and renewal of the human race, this is the good of wedlock, by which man is
born in the union that is appointed. Nobody, however, is born again in Christ’s body, unless
he be previously born in the body of sin. But inasmuch as it is evil to make a bad use of a
good thing, so is it good to use well a bad thing. These two ideas therefore of good and evil,
and those other two of a good use and an evil use, when they are duly combined together,
produce four different conditions:—<del>1</del> A man makes a good use of a good thing, when he
dedicates his continence to God; <del>2.</del> He makes a bad use of a good thing, when he dedicates
his continence to an idol; <del>3.</del> He makes a bad use of an evil thing, when he loosely gratifies
his concupiscence by adultery; <del>4.</del> He makes a good use of an evil thing, when he restrains
his concupiscence by matrimony. Now, as it is better to make good use of a good thing than
to make good rise of an evil thing,—since both are good,—so “he that giveth his virgin in
marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.” 411 This question,
indeed, I have treated at greater length, and more sufficiently, as God enabled me according
to my humble abilities, in two works of mine,—one of them, On the Good of Marriage, and
the other, On Holy Virginity. They, therefore, who extol the flesh and blood of a sinful
creature, to the prejudice of the Redeemer’s flesh and blood, must not defend the evil of
concupiscence through the good of marriage; nor should they, from whose infant age the
Lord has inculcated in us a lesson of humility,412 be lifted up into pride by the error of
others. He only was born without sin whom a virgin conceived without the embrace of a
husband,—not by the concupiscence of the flesh, but by the chaste submission of her mind.413
She alone was able to give birth to One who should heal our wound, who brought forth the
germ of a pure offspring without the wound of sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 58 <del>XXX.</del>—In What Respect the Pelagians Regarded Baptism as Necessary
for Infants.</head>
<p>Let us now examine more carefully, so far as the Lord enables us, that very chapter of
the Gospel where He says, “Except a man be born again,—of water and the Spirit,— he shall
not enter into the kingdom of God.”414 If it were not for the authority which this sentence
has with them, they would not be of opinion that infants ought to be baptized at all. This is
their comment on the passage: “Because He does not say, ‘Except a man be born again of
water and the Spirit, he shall not have salvation or eternal life,’ but He merely said, ‘he shall
not enter into the kingdom of God,’ therefore infants are to be baptized, in order that they
may be with Christ in the kingdom of God, where they will not be unless they are baptized.
Should infants die, however, even without baptism, they will have salvation and eternal life,
seeing that they are bound with no fetter of sin.” Now in such a statement as this, the first
thing that strikes one is, that they never explain where the justice is of separating from the
kingdom of God that “image of God” which has no sin. Next, we ought to see whether the
Lord Jesus, the one only good Teacher, has not in this very passage of the Gospel intimated,
and indeed shown us, that it only comes to pass through the remission of their sins that
baptized persons reach the kingdom of God; although to persons of a right understanding,
the words, as they stand in the passage, ought to be sufficiently explicit: “Except a man be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God;”415 and: “Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”416 For why should he be born
again, unless to be renewed? From what is he to be renewed, if not from some old condition?
From what old condition, but that in which “our old man is crucified with Him, that the
body of sin might be destroyed?”417 Or whence comes it to pass that “the image of God”
enters not into the kingdom of God, unless it be that the impediment of sin prevents it?
However, let us (as we said before) see, as earnestly and diligently as we are able, what is the
entire context of this passage of the Gospel, on the point in question.</p>

<head>Chapter 59.—The Context of Their Chief Text.</head>
<p>“Now there was,” we read, “a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto Him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a
teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be
with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto Him, How can a
man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be
born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh;
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be
born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst
not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, How can these things be? Jesus answered and
said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I
say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not
our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell
you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down
from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent
in the wilderness,418 even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in
Him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that He gave His
only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world
through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten
Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth
evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he
that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are
wrought in God.”419 Thus far the Lord’s discourse wholly relates to the subject of our present
inquiry; from this point the sacred historian digresses to another matter.</p>

<head>Chapter 60 <del>XXXI.</del>—Christ, the Head and the Body; Owing to the Union of the
Natures in the Person of Christ, He Both Remained in Heaven, and Walked
About on Earth; How the One Christ Could Ascend to Heaven; The Head, and
the Body, the One Christ.</head>
<p>Now when Nicodemus understood not what was being told him, he inquired of the
Lord how such things could be. Let us look at what the Lord said to him in answer to his
inquiry; for of course, as He deigns to answer the question, How can these things be? He
will in fact tell us how spiritual regeneration can come to a man who springs from carnal
generation. After noticing briefly the ignorance of one who assumed a superiority over
others as a teacher, and having blamed the unbelief of all such, for not accepting His witness
to the truth, He went on to inquire and wonder whether, as He had told them about earthly
things and they had not believed they would believe heavenly things. He nevertheless pursues
the subject, and gives an answer such as others should believe—though these refuse—to the
question that he was asked, How these things can be? “No man,” says He, “hath ascended
up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.”
420 Thus, He says, shall come the spiritual birth,—men, from being earthly, shall become
heavenly; and this they can only obtain by being made members of me; so that he may ascend
who descended, since no one ascends who did not descend. All, therefore, who have to be
changed and raised must meet together in a union with Christ, so that the Christ who descended
may ascend, reckoning His body (that is to say, His Church) as nothing else than
Himself, because it is of Christ and the Church that this is most truly understood: “And
they twain shall be one flesh;”421 concerning which very subject He expressly said Himself,
“So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.”422 To ascend, therefore, they would be
wholly unable, since “no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from
heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.”423 For although it was on earth that He
was made the Son of man, yet He did not deem it unworthy of that divinity, in which, although
remaining in heaven, He came down to earth, to designate it by the name of the Son
of man, as He dignified His flesh with the name of Son of God: that they might not be regarded
as if they were two Christs,—the one God, the other man,424—but one and the same
God and man,—God, because “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God;”425 and man, inasmuch as “the Word was made flesh and

dwelt among us.”426 By this means—by the difference between His divinity and His humiliation—
He remained in heaven as Son of God, and as Son of man walked on earth; whilst,
by that unity of His person which made His two natures one Christ, He both walked as Son
of God on earth, and at the same time as the very Son of man remained in heaven. Faith,
therefore, in more credible things arises from the belief of such things as are more incredible.
For if His divine nature, though a far more distant object, and more sublime in its incomparable
diversity, had ability so to take upon itself the nature of man on our account as to
become one Person, and whilst appearing as Son of man on earth in the weakness of the
flesh, was able to remain all the while in heaven in the divinity which partook of the flesh,
how much easier for our faith is it to suppose that other men, who are His faithful saints,
become one Christ with the Man Christ, so that, when all ascend by His grace and fellowship,
the one Christ Himself ascends to heaven who came down from heaven? It is in this sense
that the apostle says, “As we have many members in one body, and all the members of the
body, being many, are one body, so likewise is Christ.”427 He did not say, “So also is
Christ’s”—meaning Christ’s body, or Christ’s members—but his words are, “So likewise is
Christ,” thus calling the head and body one Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 61 <del>XXXII.</del>—The Serpent Lifted Up in the Wilderness Prefigured Christ
Suspended on the Cross; Even Infants Themselves Poisoned by the Serpent’s
Bite.</head>
<p>And since this great and wonderful dignity can only be attained by the remission of
sins, He goes on to say, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
eternal life.”428 We know what at that time happened in the wilderness. Many were dying
of the bite of serpents: the people then confessed their sins, and, through Moses, besought
the Lord to take away from them this poison; accordingly, Moses, at the Lord’s command,
lifted up a brazen serpent in the wilderness, and admonished the people that every one who
had been serpent-bitten should look upon the uplifted figure. When they did so they were
immediately healed.429 What means the uplifted serpent but the death of Christ, by that
mode of expressing a sign, whereby the thing which is effected is signified by that which
effects it? Now death came by the serpent, which persuaded man to commit the sin, by
which he deserved to die. The Lord, however, transferred to His own flesh not sin, as the
poison of the serpent, but He did transfer to it death, that the penalty without the fault might
transpire in the likeness of sinful flesh, whence, in the sinful flesh, both the fault might be
removed and the penalty. As, therefore, it then came to pass that whoever looked at the
raised serpent was both healed of the poison and freed from death, so also now, whosoever
is conformed to the likeness of the death of Christ by faith in Him and His baptism, is freed
both from sin by justification, and from death by resurrection. For this is what He says:
“That whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.”430 What necessity
then could there be for an infant’s being conformed to the death of Christ by baptism, if he
were not altogether poisoned by the bite of the serpent?</p>

<p>He then proceeds thus, saying: “God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”431 Every
infant, therefore, was destined to perish, and to lose everlasting life, if through the sacrament
of baptism he believed not in the only-begotten Son of God; while nevertheless, He comes
not so that he may judge the world, but that the world through Him may be saved. This especially
appears in the following clause, wherein He says, “He that believeth in Him is not
condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.”432 In what class, then, do we place baptized
infants but amongst believers, as the authority of the catholic Church everywhere asserts?
They belong, therefore, among those who have believed; for this is obtained for them by
virtue of the sacrament and the answer of their sponsors. And from this it follows that such
as are not baptized are reckoned among those who have not believed. Now if they who are
baptized are not condemned, these last, as not being baptized, are condemned. He adds,
indeed: “But this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved
darkness rather than light.433 Of what does He say, “Light is come into the world,” if not of
His own advent? and without the sacrament of His advent, how are infants said to be in the
light? And why should we not include this fact also in “men’s love of darkness,” that as they
do not themselves believe, so they refuse to think that their infants ought to be baptized,
although they are afraid of their incurring the death of the body? “In God,” however, he
declares are the “works of him wrought, who cometh to the light,”434 because he is quite
aware that his justification results from no merits of his own, but from the grace of God.
“For it is God,” says the apostle, “who worketh in you both to will and to do of His own
good pleasure.”435 This then is the way in which spiritual regeneration is effected in all who
come to Christ from their carnal generation. He explained it Himself, and pointed it out,
when He was asked, How these things could be? He left it open to no man to settle such a
question by human reasoning, lest infants should be deprived of the grace of the remission
of sins. There is no other passage leading to Christ; no man can be reconciled to God, or
can come to God otherwise, than through Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 63 <del>XXXIV.</del>—The Form, or Rite, of Baptism. Exorcism.</head>
<p>What shall I say of the actual form of this sacrament? I only wish some one of those
who espouse the contrary side would bring me an infant to be baptized. What does my exorcism
work in that babe, if he be not held in the devil’s family? The man who brought the
infant would certainly have had to act as sponsor for him, for he could not answer for
himself. How would it be possible then for him to declare that he renounced the devil, if
there was no devil in him? that he was converted to God, if he had never been averted from
Him? that he believed, besides other articles, in the forgiveness of sins, if no sins were attributable
to him? For my own part, indeed, if I thought that his opinions were opposed to this
faith, I could not permit him to bring the infant to the sacraments. Nor can I imagine with
what countenance before men, or what mind before God, he can conduct himself in this.
But I do not wish to say anything too severe. That a false or fallacious form of baptism should
be administered to infants, in which there might be the sound and semblance of something
being done, but yet no remission of sins actually ensue, has been seen by some amongst
them to be as abominable and hateful a thing as it was possible to mention or conceive.
Then, again, in respect of the necessity of baptism to infants, they admit that even infants
stand in need of redemption,—a concession which is made in a short treatise written by one
of their party,—but yet there is not found in this work any open admission of the forgiveness
of a single sin. According, however, to an intimation dropped in your letter to me, they now
acknowledge, as you say, that a remission of sins takes place even in infants through baptism.
No wonder; for it is impossible that redemption should be understood in any other way.
Their own words are these: “It is, however, not originally, but in their own actual life, after
they have been born, that they have begun to have sin.”</p>

<head>Chapter 64.—A Twofold Mistake Respecting Infants.</head>
<p>You see how great a difference there is amongst those whom I have been opposing at
such length and persistency in this work,—one of whom has written the book which contains
the points I have refuted to the best of my ability. You see as I was saying, the important
difference existing between such of them as maintain that infants are absolutely pure and
free from all sin, whether original or actual; and those who suppose that so soon as born
infants have contracted actual sins of their own, from which they need cleansing by baptism.
The latter class, indeed, by examining the Scriptures, and considering the authority of the
whole Church as well as the form of the sacrament itself, have clearly seen that by baptism
remission of sins accrues to infants; but they are either unwilling or unable to allow that the
sin which infants have is original sin. The former class, however, have clearly seen (as they
easily might) that in the very nature of man, which is open to the consideration of all men,
the tender age of which we speak could not possibly commit any sin whatever in its own
proper conduct; but, to avoid acknowledging original sin, they assert that there is no sin at
all in infants. Now in the truths which they thus severally maintain, it so happens that they
first of all mutually agree with each other, and subsequently differ from us in material aspect.
For if the one party concede to the other that remission of sins takes place in all infants
which are baptized, whilst the other concedes to their opponents that infants (as infant
nature itself in its silence loudly proclaims) have as yet contracted no sin in their own living,
then both sides must agree in conceding to us, that nothing remains but original sin, which
can be remitted in baptism to infants.</p>

life—infants could never commit an offence, whom all, for this very reason, are in the habit
of calling innocent? Does not their great weakness of mind and body, their great ignorance
of things, their utter inability to obey a precept, the absence in them of all perception and
impression of law, either natural or written, the complete want of reason to impel them in
either direction,—proclaim and demonstrate the point before us by a silent testimony far
more expressive than any argument of ours? The very palpableness of the fact must surely
go a great way to persuade us of its truth; for there is no place where I do not find traces of
what I say, so ubiquitous is the fact of which we are speaking,—clearer, indeed, to perceive

<head>Chapter 66.—Infants’ Faults Spring from Their Sheer Ignorance.</head>
<p>I should, however, wish any one who was wise on the point to tell me what sin he has
seen or thought of in a new-born infant, for redemption from which he allows baptism to
be already necessary; what kind of evil it has in its own proper life committed by its own
mind or body. If it should happen to cry and to be wearisome to its elders, I wonder
whether my informant would ascribe this to iniquity, and not rather to unhappiness. What,
too, would he say to the fact that it is hushed from its very weeping by no appeal to its own
reason, and by no prohibition of any one else? This, however, comes from the ignorance in
which it is so deeply steeped, by reason of which, too, when it grows stronger, as it very soon
does, it strikes its mother in its little passion, and often her very breasts which it sucks when
it is hungry. Well, now, these small freaks are not only borne in very young children, but
are actually loved,—and this with what affection except that of the flesh,436 by which we are
delighted by a laugh or a joke, seasoned with fun and nonsense by clever persons, although,
if it were understood literally, as it is spoken, they would not be laughed with as facetious,
but at as simpletons? We see, also, how those simpletons whom the common people call
Moriones437 are used for the amusement of the sane; and that they fetch higher prices than
the sane when appraised for the slave market. So great, then, is the influence of mere natural
feeling, even over those who are by no means simpletons, in producing amusement at another’s
misfortune. Now, although a man may be amused by another man’s silliness, he
would still dislike to be a simpleton himself; and if the father, who gladly enough looks out
for, and even provokes, such things from his own prattling boy, were to foreknow that he
would, when grown up, turn out a fool, he would without doubt think him more to be
grieved for than if he were dead. While, however, hope remains of growth, and the light of
intellect is expected to increase with the increase of years, then the insults of young children
even to their parents seem not merely not wrong, but even agreeable and pleasant. No
prudent man, doubtless, could possibly approve of not only not forbidding in children such
conduct in word or deed as this, as soon as they are able to be forbidden, but even of exciting
them to it, for the vain amusement of their elders. For as soon as children are of an age to
know their father and mother, they dare not use wrong words to either, unless permitted
or bidden by either, or both. But such things can only belong to such young children as are
just striving to lisp out words, and whose minds are just able to give some sort of motion
to their tongue. Let us, however, consider the depth of the ignorance rather of the new-born
babes, out of which, as they advance in age, they come to this merely temporary stuttering
folly,—on their road, as it were, to knowledge and speech.</p>

<head>Chapter 67 <del>XXXVI.</del>—On the Ignorance of Infants, and Whence It Arises.</head>
<p>Yes, let us consider that darkness of their rational intellect, by reason of which they are
even completely ignorant of God, whose sacraments they actually struggle against, while
being baptized. Now my inquiry is, When and whence came they to be immersed in this
darkness? Is it then the fact that they incurred it all here, and in this their own proper life
forgat God through too much negligence, after a life of wisdom and religion in their mother’s
womb? Let those say so who dare; let them listen to it who wish to; let them believe it who
can. I, however, am sure that none whose minds are not blinded by an obstinate adherence
to a foregone conclusion can possibly entertain such an opinion. Is there then no evil in ignorance,—
nothing which needs to be purged away? What means that prayer “Remember
not the sins of my youth and of my ignorance?”438 For although those sins are more to be
condemned which are knowingly committed, yet if there were no sins of ignorance, we
should not have read in Scripture what I have quoted, “Remember not the sins of my youth
and of my ignorance.” Seeing now that the soul of an infant fresh from its mother’s womb
is still the soul of a human being,—nay, the soul of a rational creature,—not only untaught,
but even incapable of instruction, I ask why, or when, or whence, it was plunged into that
thick darkness of ignorance in which it lies? If it is man’s nature thus to begin, and that
nature is not already corrupt, then why was not Adam created thus? Why was he capable
of receiving a commandment? and able to give names to his wife, and to all the animal creation?
For of her he said, “She shall be called Woman;”439 and in respect of the rest we read:
“Whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.”440 Whereas
this one, although he is ignorant where he is, what he is, by whom created, of what parents
born, is already guilty of offence, incapable as yet of receiving a commandment, and so
completely involved and overwhelmed in a thick cloud of ignorance, that he cannot be
aroused out of his sleep, so as to recognize even these facts; but a time must be patiently
awaited, until he can shake off this strange intoxication, as it were, (not indeed in a single
night, as even the heaviest drunkenness usually can be, but) little by little, through many
months, and even years; and until this be accomplished, we have to bear in little children
so many things which we punish in older persons, that we cannot enumerate them. Now,
as touching this enormous evil of ignorance and weakness, if in this present life infants have
contracted it as soon as they were born, where, when, how, have they by the perpetration
of some great iniquity become suddenly implicated in such darkness?</p>

<head>Chapter 68 <del>XXXVII.</del>If Adam Was Not Created of Such a Character as that in
Which We are Born, How is It that Christ, Although Free from Sin, Was Born
an Infant and in Weakness?</head>
<p>Some one will ask, If this nature is not pure, but corrupt from its origin, since Adam
was not created thus, how is it that Christ, who is far more excellent, and was certainly born
without any sin of a virgin, nevertheless appeared in this weakness, and came into the world
in infancy? To this question our answer is as follows: Adam was not created in such a state,
because, as no sin from a parent preceded him, he was not created in sinful flesh. We,
however, are in such a condition, because by reason of his preceding sin we are born in
sinful flesh. While Christ was born in such a state, because, in order that He might for sin
condemn sin, He assumed the likeness of sinful flesh.441 The question which we are now
discussing is not about Adam in respect of the size of his body, why he was not made an
infant but in the perfect greatness of his members. It may indeed be said that the beasts were
thus created likewise,—nor was it owing to their sin that their young were born small. Why
all this came to pass we are not now asking. But the question before us has regard to the
vigor of man’s mind and his use of reason, by virtue of which Adam was capable of instruction,
and could apprehend God’s precept and the law of His commandment, and could
easily keep it if he would; whereas man is now born in such a state as to be utterly incapable
of doing so, owing to his dreadful ignorance and weakness, not indeed of body, but of
mind,—although we must all admit that in every infant there exists a rational soul of the
self-same substance (and no other) as that which belonged to the first man. Still this great
infirmity of the flesh, clearly, in my opinion, points to a something, whatever it may be, that
is penal. It raises the doubt whether, if the first human beings had not sinned, they would
have had children who could use neither tongue, nor hands, nor feet. That they should be
born children was perhaps necessary, on account of the limited capacity of the womb. But,
at the same time, it does not follow, because a rib is a small part of a man’s body, that God
made an infant wife for the man, and then built her up into a woman. In like manner, God’s
almighty power was competent to make her children also, as soon as born, grown up at
once.</p>

<head>Chapter 69 <del>XXXVIII.</del>—The Ignorance and the Infirmity of an Infant.</head>
<p>But not to dwell on this, that was at least possible to them which has actually happened
to many animals, the young of which are born small, and do not advance in mind (since
they have no rational soul) as their bodies grow larger, and yet, even when most diminutive,
run about, and recognize their mothers, and require no external help or care when they
want to suck, but with remarkable ease discover their mothers’ breasts themselves, although
these are concealed from ordinary sight. A human being, on the contrary, at his birth is
furnished neither with feet fit for walking, nor with hands able even to scratch; and unless
their lips were actually applied to the breast by the mother, they would not know where to
find it; and even when close to the nipple, they would, notwithstanding their desire for food,
be more able to cry than to suck. This utter helplessness of body thus fits in with their infirmity
of mind; nor would Christ’s flesh have been “in the likeness of sinful flesh,” unless
that sinful flesh had been such that the rational soul is oppressed by it in the way we have
described,—whether this too has been derived from parents, or created in each case for the
individual separately, or inspired from above,—concerning which I forbear from inquiring
now.</p>

<head>Chapter 70 <del>XXXIX.</del>—How Far Sin is Done Away in Infants by Baptism, Also in
Adults, and What Advantage Results Therefrom.</head>
<p>In infants it is certain that, by the grace of God, through His baptism who came in the
likeness of sinful flesh, it is brought to pass that the sinful flesh is done away. This result,
however, is so effected, that the concupiscence which is diffused over and innate in the living
flesh itself is not removed all at once, so as to exist in it no longer; but only that that might
not be injurious to a man at his death, which was inherent at his birth. For should an infant
live after baptism, and arrive at an age capable of obedience to a law, he finds there somewhat
to fight against, and, by God’s help, to overcome, if he has not received His grace in vain,
and if he is not willing to be a reprobate. For not even to those who are of riper years is it
given in baptism (except, perhaps, by an unspeakable miracle of the almighty Creator), that
the law of sin which is in their members, warring against the law of their mind, should be
entirely extinguished, and cease to exist; but that whatever of evil has been done, said, or
thought by a man whilst he was servant to a mind subject to its concupiscence, should be
abolished, and regarded as if it had never occurred. The concupiscence itself, however,
(notwithstanding the loosening of the bond of guilt in which the devil, by it, used to keep
the soul, and the destruction of the barrier which separated man from his Maker,) remains
in the contest in which we chasten our body and bring it into subjection, whether to be relaxed
for lawful and necessary uses, or to be restrained by continence.442 But inasmuch as
the Spirit of God, who knows so much better than we do all the past, and present, and future
of the human race, foresaw and foretold that the life of man would be such that “no man
living should be justified in God’s sight,”443 it happens that through ignorance or infirmity
we do not exert all the powers of our will against it, and so yield to it in the commission of
sundry unlawful things,—becoming worse in proportion to the greatness and frequency of
our surrender; and better, in proportion to its unimportance and infrequency. The investigation,
however, of the point in which we are now interested—whether there could possibly
be (or whether in fact there is, has been, or ever will be) a man without sin in this present
life, except Him who said, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in
me”444—requires a much fuller discussion; and the arrangement of the present treatise is
such as to make us postpone the question to the commencement of another book.</p>

<p>In which Augustin argues against such as say that in the present life there are, have been, and
will be, men who have absolutely no sin at all. He lays down four propositions on this
head: and teaches, first, that a man might possibly live in the present life without sin, by
the grace of God and his own free will; he next shows that nevertheless in fact there is no
man who lives quite free from sin in this life; thirdly, he sets forth the reason of this,—because
there is no man who exactly confines his wishes within the limits of the just requirement
of each case, which just requirement he either fails to perceive, or is unwilling to
carry out in practice; in the fourth place, he proves that there is not, nor has been, nor
ever will be, a human being—except the one mediator, Christ—who is free from all sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—What Has Thus Far Been Dwelt On; And What is to Be Treated in
This Book.</head>
<p>We have, my dearest Marcellinus, discussed at sufficient length, I think, in the former
book the baptism of infants,—how that it is given to them not only for entrance into the
kingdom of God, but also for attaining salvation and eternal life, which none can have
without the kingdom of God, or without that union with the Saviour Christ, wherein He
has redeemed us by His blood. I undertake in the present book to discuss and explain the
question, Whether there lives in this world, or has yet lived, or ever will live, any one without
any sin whatever, except “the one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus,
who gave Himself a ransom for all;”445—with as much care and ability as He may Himself
vouchsafe to me. And should there occasionally arise in this discussion, either inevitably or
casually from the argument, any question about the baptism or the sin of infants, I must
neither be surprised nor must I shrink from giving the best answer I can, at such emergencies,
to whatever point challenges my attention.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—Some Persons Attribute Too Much to the Freedom of Man’s Will;
Ignorance and Infirmity.</head>
<p>A solution is extremely necessary of this question about a human life unassailed by any
deception or preoccupation of sin, in consequence even of our daily prayers. For there are
some persons who presume so much upon the free determination of the human will, as to
suppose that it need not sin, and that we require no divine assistance,—attributing to our
nature, once for all, this determination of free will. An inevitable consequence of this is, that
we ought not to pray “not to enter into temptation,”—that is, not to be overcome of
temptation, either when it deceives and surprises us in our ignorance, or when it presses
and importunes us in our weakness. Now how hurtful, and how pernicious and contrary
to our salvation in Christ, and how violently adverse to the religion itself in which we are
instructed, and to the piety whereby we worship God, it cannot but be for us not to beseech
the Lord for the attainment of such a benefit, but be rather led to think that petition of the
Lord’s Prayer, “Lead us not into temptation,”446 a vain and useless insertion,—it is beyond
my ability to express in words.</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>III.</del>—In What Way God Commands Nothing Impossible. Works of
Mercy, Means of Wiping Out Sins.</head>
<p>Now these people imagine that they are acute (as if none among us knew it) when they
say, that “if we have not the will, we commit no sin; nor would God command man to do
what was impossible for human volition.” But they do not see, that in order to overcome
certain things, which are the objects either of an evil desire or an ill-conceived fear, men
need the strenuous efforts, and sometimes even all the energies, of the will; and that we
should only imperfectly employ these in every instance, He foresaw who willed so true an
utterance to be spoken by the prophet: “In Thy sight shall no man living be justified.”447
The Lord, therefore, foreseeing that such would be our character, was pleased to provide
and endow with efficacious virtue certain healthful remedies against the guilt and bonds
even of sins committed after baptism,—for instance, the works of mercy,—as when he says:
“Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you.”448 For who could
quit this life with any hope of obtaining eternal salvation, with that sentence impending:
“Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,”449 if
there did not soon after follow: “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
law of liberty: for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy; and
mercy rejoiceth against judgment?”450</p>

<head>Chapter 4 <del>IV.</del>—Concupiscence, How Far in Us; The Baptized are Not Injured by
Concupiscence, But Only by Consent Therewith.</head>
<p>Concupiscence, therefore, as the law of sin which remains in the members of this body
of death, is born with infants. In baptized infants, it is deprived of guilt, is left for the struggle
<del>of life</del>,451 but pursues with no condemnation, such as die before the struggle. Unbaptized
infants it implicates as guilty and as children of wrath, even if they die in infancy, draws
into condemnation. In baptized adults, however, endowed with reason, whatever consent
their mind gives to this concupiscence for the commission of sin is an act of their own will.
After all sins have been blotted out, and that guilt has been cancelled which by nature452
bound men in a conquered condition, it still remains,—but not to hurt in any way those
who yield no consent to it for unlawful deeds,—until death is swallowed up in victory453
and, in that perfection of peace, nothing is left to be conquered. Such, however, as yield
consent to it for the commission of unlawful deeds, it holds as guilty; and unless, through
the medicine of repentance, and through works of mercy, by the intercession in our behalf
of the heavenly High Priest, they be healed, it conducts us to the second death and utter
condemnation. It was on this account that the Lord, when teaching us to pray, advised us,
besides other petitions, to say: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us
not into tempation, but deliver us from evil.”454 For evil remains in our flesh, not by reason
of the nature in which man was created by God and wisdom, but by reason of that offence
into which he fell by his own will, and in which, since its powers are lost, he is not healed
with the same facility of will as that with which he was wounded. Of this evil the apostle
says: “I know that in my flesh dwelleth no good thing;”455 and it is likewise to the same evil
that he counsels us to give no obedience, when he says: “Let not sin therefore reign in your
mortal body, to obey the lusts thereof.”456 When, therefore, we have by an unlawful inclination
of our will yielded consent to these lusts of the flesh, we say, with a view to the cure
of this fault, “Forgive us our debts;”457 and we at the same time apply the remedy of a work
of mercy, in that we add, “As we forgive our debtors.” That we may not, however, yield such
consent, let us pray for assistance, and say, “And lead us not into temptation;”—not that
God ever Himself tempts any one with such temptation, “for God is not a tempter to evil,

neither tempteth He any man;”458 but in order that whenever we feel the rising of temptation
from our concupiscence, we may not be deserted by His help, in order that thereby we may
be able to conquer, and not be carried away by enticement. We then add our request for
that which is to be perfected at the last, when mortality shall be swallowed up of life:459 “But
deliver us from evil.”460 For then there will exist no longer a concupiscence which we are
bidden to struggle against, and not to consent to. The whole substance, accordingly, of these
three petitions may be thus briefly expressed: “Pardon us for those things in which we have
been drawn away by concupiscence; help us not to be drawn away by concupiscence; take
away concupiscence from us.”</p>

<head>Chapter 5 <del>V.</del>—The Will of Man Requires the Help of God.</head>
<p>Now for the commission of sin we get no help from God; but we are not able to do
justly, and to fulfil the law of righteousness in every part thereof, except we are helped by
God. For as the bodily eye is not helped by the light to turn away therefrom shut or averted,
but is helped by it to see, and cannot see at all unless it help it; so God, who is the light of
the inner man, helps our mental sight, in order that we may do some good, not according
to our own, but according to His righteousness. But if we turn away from Him, it is our own
act; we then are wise according to the flesh, we then consent to the concupiscence of the
flesh for unlawful deeds. When we turn to Him, therefore, God helps us; when we turn away
from Him, He forsakes us. But then He helps us even to turn to Him; and this, certainly, is
something that light does not do for the eyes of the body. When, therefore, He commands
us in the words, “Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you,”461 and we say to Him, “Turn
us, O God of our salvation,”462 and again, “Turn us, O God of hosts;”463 what else do we
say than, “Give what Thou commandest?”464 When He commands us, saying, “Understand
now, ye simple among the people,”465 and we say to Him, “Give me understanding, that I
may learn Thy commandments;”466 what else do we say than, “Give what Thou commandest?”
When He commands us, saying, “Go not after thy lusts,”467 and we say to Him, “We
know that no man can be continent, except God gives it to him;”468 what else do we say
than, “Give what Thou commandest?” When He commands us, saying, “Do justice,”469 and
we say, “Teach me Thy judgments, O Lord;”470 what else do we say than, “Give what Thou
commandest?” In like manner, when He says: “Blessed are they which hunger and thirst
after righteousness; for they shall be filled,”471 from whom ought we to seek for the meat
and drink of righteousness, but from Him who promises His fulness to such as hunger and
thirst after it?</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Wherein the Pharisee Sinned When He Thanked God; To God’s Grace
Must Be Added the Exertion of Our Own Will.</head>
<p>Let us then drive away from our ears and minds those who say that we ought to accept
the determination of our own free will and not pray God to help us not to sin. By such
darkness as this even the Pharisee was not blinded; for although he erred in thinking that
he needed no addition to his righteousness, and supposed himself to be saturated with
abundance of it, he nevertheless gave thanks to God that he was not “like other men, unjust,
extortioners, adulterers, or even as the publican; for he fasted twice in the week, he gave
tithes of all that he possessed.”472 He wished, indeed, for no addition to his own righteousness;
but yet, by giving thanks to God, he confessed that all he had he had received from
Him. Notwithstanding, he was not approved, both because he asked for no further food of
righteousness, as if he were already filled, and because he arrogantly preferred himself to
the publican, who was hungering and thirsting after righteousness. What, then, is to be said
of those who, whilst acknowledging that they have no righteousness, or no fulness thereof,
yet imagine that it is to be had from themselves alone, not to be besought from their Creator,
in whom is its store and its fountain? And yet this is not a question about prayers alone, as
if the energy of our will also should not be strenuously added. God is said to be “our Helper;”
473 but nobody can be helped who does not make some effort of his own accord. For
God does not work our salvation in us as if he were working in insensate stones, or in
creatures in whom nature has placed neither reason nor will. Why, however, He helps one
man, but not another; or why one man so much, and another so much; or why one man in
one way, and another in another,—He reserves to Himself according to the method of His
own most secret justice, and to the excellency of His power.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>VI.</del>—Four Questions on the Perfection of Righteousness: (1.) Whether
a Man Can Be Without Sin in This Life.</head>
<p>Now those who aver that a man can exist in this life without sin, must not be immediately
opposed with incautious rashness; for if we should deny the possibility, we should derogate
both from the free will of man, who in his wish desires it, and from the power or mercy of
God, who by His help effects it. But it is one question, whether he could exist; and another
question, whether he does exist. Again, it is one question, if he does not exist when he could
exist, why he does not exist; and another question, whether such a man as had never sinned
at all, not only is in existence, but also could ever have existed, or can ever exist. Now, if in
the order of this fourfold set of interrogative propositions, I were asked, <del>1st,</del> Whether it
be possible for a man in this life to be without sin? I should allow the possibility, through
the grace of God and the man’s own free will; not doubting that the free will itself is ascribable
to God’s grace, in other words, to the gifts of God,—not only as to its existence, but also as
to its being good, that is, to its conversion to doing the commandments of God. Thus it is
that God’s grace not only shows what ought to be done, but also helps to the possibility of
doing what it shows. “What indeed have we that we have not received?”474 Whence also
Jeremiah says: “I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man to
walk and direct his steps.”475 Accordingly, when in the Psalms one says to God, “Thou hast
commanded me to keep Thy precepts diligently,”476 he at once adds not a word of confidence
concerning himself but a wish to be able to keep these precepts: “O that my ways,” says he,
“were directed to keep Thy statutes! Then should I not be ashamed, when I have respect to
all Thy commandments?477 Now who ever wishes for what he has already so in his own
power, that he requires no further help for attaining it? To whom, however, he directs his
wish,—not to fortune, or fate, or some one else besides God,—he shows with sufficient
clearness in the following words, where he says: “Order my steps in Thy word; and let not
any iniquity have dominion over me.”478 From the thraldom of this execrable dominion
they are liberated, to whom the Lord Jesus gave power to become the sons of God.479 From
so horrible a domination were they to be freed, to whom He says, “If the Son shall make
you free, then shall ye be free indeed.”480 From these and many other like testimonies, I

there be a sinless man,—I believe there is not. For I rather believe the Scripture, which says:
“Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.”
481 There is therefore need of the mercy of God, which “exceedingly rejoiceth against
judgment,”482 and which that man shall not obtain who does not show mercy.483 And
whereas the prophet says, “I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and Thou
forgavest the iniquity of my heart,”484 he yet immediately adds, “For this shall every saint
pray unto Thee in an acceptable time.”485 Not indeed every sinner, but “every saint;” for it
is the voice of saints which says, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
the truth is not in us.”486 Accordingly we read, in the Apocalypse of the same Apostle, of
“the hundred and forty and four thousand” saints, “which were not defiled with women;
for they continued virgins: and in their mouth was found no guile; for they are without
fault.”487 “Without fault,” indeed, they no doubt are for this reason,—because they truly
found fault with themselves; and for this reason, “in their mouth was discovered no
guile,”—“because if they said they had no sin, they deceived themselves, and the truth was
not in them.”488 Of course, where the truth was not, there would be guile; and when a
righteous man begins a statement by accusing himself, he verily utters no falsehood.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—The Beginning of Renewal; Resurrection Called Regeneration; They
are the Sons of God Who Lead Lives Suitable to Newness of Life.</head>
<p>And hence in the passage, “Whosoever is born of God doth not sin, and he cannot sin,
for His seed remaineth in him,”489 and in every other passage of like import, they much
deceive themselves by an inadequate consideration of the Scriptures. For they fail to observe
that men severally become sons of God when they begin to live in newness of spirit, and to
be renewed as to the inner man after the image of Him that created them.490 For it is not
from the moment of a man’s baptism that all his old infirmity is destroyed, but renovation
begins with the remission of all his sins, and so far as he who is now wise is spiritually wise.
All things else, however, are accomplished in hope, looking forward to their being also
realized in fact,491 even to the renewal of the body itself in that better state of immortality
and incorruption with which we shall be clothed at the resurrection of the dead. For this
too the Lord calls a regeneration,—though, of course, not such as occurs through baptism,
but still a regeneration wherein that which is now begun in the spirit shall be brought to
perfection also in the body. “In the regeneration,” says He, “when the Son of man shall sit
in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.”492 For however entire and full be the remission of sins in baptism, nevertheless, if
there was wrought by it at once, an entire and full change of the man into his everlasting
newness,—I do not mean change in his body, which is now most clearly tending evermore
to the old corruption and to death, after which it is to be renewed into a total and true
newness,—but, the body being excepted, if in the soul itself, which is the inner man, a perfect
renewal was wrought in baptism, the apostle would not say: “Even though our outward man
perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.”493 Now, undoubtedly, he who is still
renewed day by day is not as yet wholly renewed; and in so far as he is not yet wholly renewed,
he is still in his old state. Since, then, men, even after they are baptized, are still in some degree
in their old condition, they are on that account also still children of the world; but inasmuch
as they are also admitted into a new state, that is to say, by the full and perfect remission of
their sins, and in so far as they are spiritually-minded, and behave correspondingly, they
are the children of God. Internally we put off the old man and put on the new; for we then
and there lay aside lying, and speak truth, and do those other things wherein the apostle
makes to consist the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new, which after

God is created in righteousness and true holiness.494 Now it is men who are already baptized
and faithful whom he exhorts to do this,—an exhortation which would be unsuitable to
them, if the absolute and perfect change had been already made in their baptism. And yet
made it was, since we were then actually saved; for “He saved us by the laver of regeneration.”
495 In another passage, however, he tells us how this took place. “Not they only,” says
he, “but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan
within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are
saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope
for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.”496</p>

<head>Chapter 10 <del>VIII.</del>—Perfection, When to Be Realized.</head>
<p>Our full adoption, then, as children, is to happen at the redemption of our body. It is
therefore the first-fruits of the Spirit which we now possess, whence we are already really
become the children of God; for the rest, indeed, as it is by hope that we are saved and renewed,
so are we the children of God. But inasmuch as we are not yet actually saved, we are
also not yet fully renewed, nor yet also fully sons of God, but children of the world. We are
therefore advancing in renewal and holiness of life,—and it is by this that we are children
of God, and by this also we cannot commit sin;—until at last the whole of that by which we
are kept as yet children of this world is changed into this;—for it is owing to this that we are
as yet able to sin. Hence it comes to pass that “whosoever is born of God doth not commit
sin;”497 and as well, “if we were to say that we have no sin, we should deceive ourselves, and
the truth would not be in us.”498 There shall be then an end put to that within us which
keeps us children of the flesh and of the world; whilst that other shall be perfected which
makes us the children of God, and renews us by His Spirit. Accordingly the same John says,
“Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be.”499 Now
what means this variety in the expressions, “we are,” and “we shall be,” but this —we are in
hope, we shall be in reality? For he goes on to say, “We know that when He shall appear, we
shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.”500 We have therefore even now begun to
be like Him, having the first-fruits of the Spirit; but yet we are still unlike Him, by reason
of the remainders of the old nature. In as far, then, as we are like Him, in so far are we, by
the regenerating Spirit, sons of God; but in as far as we are unlike Him, in so far are we the
children of the flesh and of the world. On the one side, we cannot commit sin; but, on the
other, if we say that we have no sin, we only deceive ourselves,—until we pass entirely into
the adoption, and the sinner be no more, and you look for his place and find it not.501</p>

<head>Chapter 11 <del>IX.</del>—An Objection of the Pelagians: Why Does Not a Righteous Man
Beget a Righteous Man?502</head>
<p>In vain, then, do some of them argue: “If a sinner begets a sinner, so that the guilt of
original sin must be done away in his infant son by his receiving baptism, in like manner
ought a righteous man to beget a righteous son.” Just as if a man begat children in the flesh
by reason of his righteousness, and not because he is moved thereto by the concupiscence
which is in his members, and the law of sin is applied by the law of his mind to the purpose
of procreation. His begetting children, therefore, shows that he still retains the old nature
among the children of this world; it does not arise from the fact of his promotion to newness
of life among the children of God. For “the children of this world beget and are begotten.”503
Hence also what is born of them is like them; for “that which is born of the flesh is flesh.”504
Only the children of God, however, are righteous; but in so far as they are the children of
God, they do not carnally beget, because it is of the Spirit, and not of the flesh, that they are
themselves begotten. But as many of them as become parents, beget children from the circumstance
that they have not yet put off the entire remains of their old nature in exchange
for the perfect renovation which awaits them. It follows, therefore, that every son who is
born in this old and infirm condition of his father’s nature, must needs himself partake of
the same old and infirm condition. In order, then, that he may be begotten again, he must
also himself be renewed by the Spirit through the remission of sin; and if this change does
not take place in him, his righteous father will be of no use to him. For it is by the Spirit that
he is righteous, but it is not by the Spirit that he begat his son. On the other hand, if this
change does accrue to him, he will not be damaged by an unrighteous father: for it is by the
grace of the Spirit that he has passed into the hope of the eternal newness; whereas it is owing
to his carnal mind that his father has wholly remained in the old nature.</p>

<head>Chapter 12 <del>X.</del>—He Reconciles Some Passages of Scripture.</head>
<p>The statement, therefore, “He that is born of God sinneth not,”505 is not contrary to
the passage in which it is declared by those who are born of God, “If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”506 For however complete may be a
man’s present hope, and however real may be his renewal by spiritual regeneration in that
part of his nature, he still, for all that, carries about a body which is corrupt, and which
presses down his soul; and so long as this is the case, one must distinguish even in the same
individual the relation and source of each several action. Now, I suppose it is not easy to
find in God’s Scripture so weighty a testimony of holiness given of any man as that which
is written of His three servants, Noah, Daniel, and Job, whom the Prophet Ezekiel describes
as the only men able to be delivered from God’s impending wrath.507 In these three men
he no doubt prefigures three classes of mankind to be delivered: in Noah, as I suppose, are
represented righteous leaders of nations, by reason of his government of the ark as a type
of the Church; in Daniel, men who are righteous in continence; in Job, those who are
righteous in wedlock;—to say nothing of any other view of the passage, which it is unnecessary
now to consider. It is, at any rate, clear from this testimony of the prophet, and from
other inspired statements, how eminent were these worthies in righteousness. Yet no man
must be led by their history to say, for instance, that drunkenness is not sin, although so
good a man was overtaken by it; for we read that Noah was once drunk,508 but God forbid
that it should be thought that he was an habitual drunkard.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—A Subterfuge of the Pelagians.</head>
<p>Daniel, indeed, after the prayer which he poured out before God, actually says respecting
himself, “Whilst I was praying and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people, before
the Lord my God.”509 This is the reason, if I am not mistaken, why in the above-mentioned
Prophet Ezekiel a certain most haughty person is asked, “Art thou then wiser than Daniel?”510
Nor on this point can that be possibly said which some contend for in opposition to the
Lord’s Prayer: “For although,” they say, “that prayer was offered by the apostles, after they
became holy and perfect, and had no sin whatever, yet it was not in behalf of their own
selves, but of imperfect and still sinful men that they said, ‘Forgive us our debts, as we also
forgive our debtors.’ They used the word our,” they say, “in order to show that in one body
are contained both those who still have sins, and themselves, who were already altogether
free from sin.” Now this certainly cannot be said in the case of Daniel, who (as I suppose)
foresaw as a prophet this presumptuous opinion, when he said so often in his prayer, “We
have sinned;” and explained to us why he said this, not so as that we should hear from him,
Whilst I was praying and confessing the sins of my people to the Lord, my God; nor yet
confounding distinction, so as that it would be uncertain whether he had said, on account
of the fellowship of one body, While I was confessing our sins to the Lord my God; but he
expresses himself in language so distinct and precise, as if he were full of the distinction
himself, and wanted above all things to commend it to our notice: “My sins,” says he, “and
the sins of my people.” Who can gainsay such evidence as this, but he who is more pleased
to defend what he thinks than to find out what he ought to think?</p>

<head>Chapter 14. —Job Was Not Without Sin.</head>
<p>But let us see what Job has to say of himself, after God’s great testimony of his righteousness.
“I know of a truth,” he says, “that it is so: for how shall a mortal man be just before the
Lord? For if He should enter into judgment with him, he would not be able to obey Him.”511
And shortly afterwards he asks: “Who shall resist His judgment? Even if I should seem
righteous, my mouth will speak profanely.”512 And again, further on, he says: “I know He
will not leave me unpunished. But since I am ungodly, why have I not died? If I should wash
myself with snow, and be purged with clean hands, thou hadst thoroughly stained me with
filth.”513 In another of his discourses he says: “For Thou hast written evil things against me,
and hast compassed me with the sins of my youth; and Thou hast placed my foot in the
stocks. Thou hast watched all my works, and hast inspected the soles of my feet, which wax
old like a bottle, or like a moth-eaten garment. For man that is born of a woman hath but
a short time to live, and is full of wrath; like a flower that hath bloomed, so doth he fall; he
is gone like a shadow, and continueth not. Hast Thou not taken account even of him, and
caused him to enter into judgment with Thee? For who is pure from uncleanness? Not even
one; even should his life last but a day.”514 Then a little afterwards he says: “Thou hast
numbered all my necessities; and not one of my sins hath escaped Thee. Thou hast sealed
up my transgressions in a bag, and hast marked whatever I have done unwillingly.”515 See
how Job, too, confesses his sins, and says how sure he is that there is none righteous before
the Lord. So he is sure of this also, that if we say we have no sin, the truth is not in us. While,
therefore, God bestows on him His high testimony of righteousness, according to the
standard of human conduct, Job himself, taking his measure from that rule of righteousness,
which, as well as he can, he beholds in God, knows of a truth that so it is; and he goes on at
once to say, “How shall a mortal man be just before the Lord? For if He should enter into
judgment with him, he would not be able to obey Him;” in other words, if, when challenged
to judgment, he wished to show that nothing could be found in him which He could condemn,
“he would not be able to obey him,” since he misses even that obedience which might
enable him to obey Him who teaches that sins ought to be confessed. Accordingly <del>the Lord</del>
rebukes certain men, saying, “Why will ye contend with me in judgment?”516 This <del>the
Psalmist</del> averts, saying, “Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall

no man living be justified.”517 In accordance with this, Job also asks: “For who shall resist
his judgment? Even if I should seem righteous, my mouth will speak profanely;” which
means: If, contrary to His judgment, I should call myself righteous, when His perfect rule
of righteousness proves me to be unrighteous, then of a truth my mouth would speak profanely,
because it would speak against the truth of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Carnal Generation Condemned on Account of Original Sin.</head>
<p>He sets forth that this absolute weakness, or rather condemnation, of carnal generation
is from the transgression of original sin, when, treating of his own sins, he shows, as it were,
their causes, and says that “man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and
is full of wrath.” Of what wrath, but of that in which all are, as the apostle says, “by nature,”
that is, by origin, “children of wrath,”518 inasmuch as they are children of the concupiscence
of the flesh and of the world? He further shows that to this same wrath also pertains the
death of man. For after saying, “He hath but a short time to live, and is full of wrath,” he
added, “Like a flower that hath bloomed, so doth he fall; he is gone like a shadow, and continueth
not.” He then subjoins: “Hast Thou not caused him to enter into judgment with
Thee? For who is pure from uncleanness? Not even one; even should his life last but a day.”
In these words he in fact says, Thou hast thrown upon man, short-lived though he be, the
care of entering into judgment with Thee. For how brief soever be his life,—even if it last
but a single day,—he could not possibly be clean of filth; and therefore with perfect justice
must he come under Thy judgment. Then, when he says again, “Thou hast numbered all
my necessities, and not one of my sins hath escaped Thee: Thou hast sealed up my transgressions
in a bag, and hast marked whatever I have done unwillingly;” is it not clear enough
that even those sins are justly imputed which are not committed through allurement of
pleasure, but for the sake of avoiding some trouble, or pain, or death? Now these sins, too,
are said to be committed under some necessity, whereas they ought all to be overcome by
the love and pleasure of righteousness. Again, what he said in the clause, “Thou hast marked
whatever I have done unwillingly,” may evidently be connected with the saying: “For what
I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that do I.”519</p>

<head>Chapter 16—Job Foresaw that Christ Would Come to Suffer; The Way of Humility
in Those that are Perfect.</head>
<p>Now it is remarkable520 that the Lord Himself, after bestowing on Job the testimony
which is expressed in Scripture, that is, by the Spirit of God, “In all the things which happened
to him he sinned not with his lips before the Lord,”521 did yet afterwards speak to him with
a rebuke, as Job himself tells us: “Why do I yet plead, being admonished, and hearing the
rebukes of the Lord?”522 Now no man is justly rebuked unless there be in him something
which deserves rebuke. <del>XI.</del> And what sort of rebuke is this,—which, moreover, is understood
to proceed from the person of Christ our Lord? He re-counts to him all the divine
operations of His power, rebuking him under this idea,—that He seems to say to him, “Canst
thou effect all these mighty works as I can?” But to what purpose is all this but that Job might
understand (for this instruction was divinely inspired into him, that he might foreknow
Christ’s coming to suffer),—that he might understand how patiently he ought to endure all
that he went through, since Christ, although, when He became man for us, He was absolutely
without sin, and although as God He possessed so great power, did for all that by no means
refuse to obey even to the suffering of death? When Job understood this with a purer intensity
of heart, he added to his own answer these words: “I used before now to hear of Thee by the
hearing of the ear; but behold now mine eye seeth Thee: therefore I abhor myself and melt
away, and account myself but dust and ashes.”523 Why was he thus so deeply displeased
with himself? God’s work, in that he was man, could not rightly have given him displeasure,
since it is even said to God Himself, “Despise not Thou the work of Thine own hands.”524
It was indeed in view of that righteousness, in which he had discovered his own unrighteousness,
525 that he abhorred himself and melted away, and deemed himself dust and
ashes,—beholding, as he did in his mind, the righteousness of Christ, in whom there could
not possibly be any sin, not only in respect of His divinity, but also of His soul and His flesh.
It was also in view of this righteousness which is of God that the Apostle Paul, although as
“touching the righteousness which is of the law he was blameless,” yet “counted all things”
not only as loss, but even as dung. 526</p>

<head>Chapter 17 <del>XII.</del>—No One Righteous in All Things.527</head>
<p>That illustrious testimony of God, therefore, in which Job is commended, is not contrary
to the passage in which it is said, “In Thy sight shall no man living be justified;”528 for it
does not lead us to suppose that in him there was nothing at all which might either by
himself truly or by the Lord God rightly be blamed, although at the same time he might
with no untruth be said to be a righteous man, and a sincere worshipper of God, and one
who keeps himself from every evil work. For these are God’s words concerning him: “Hast
thou diligently considered my servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, blameless,
righteous, a true worshipper of God, who keeps himself from every evil work.”529 First, he
is here praised for his excellence in comparison with all men on earth. He therefore excelled
all who were at that time able to be righteous upon earth; and yet, because of this superiority
over others in righteousness, he was not therefore altogether without sin. He is next said to
be “blameless”—no one could fairly bring an accusation against him in respect of his life;
“righteous”—he had advanced so greatly in moral probity, that no man could be mentioned
on a par with him; “a true worshipper of God”—because he was a sincere and humble confessor
of his own sins; “who keeps himself from every evil work”—it would have been wonderful
if this had extended to every evil word and thought. How great a man indeed Job was,
we are not told; but we know that he was a just man; we know, too, that in the endurance
of terrible afflictions and trials he was great; and we know that it was not on account of his
sins, but for the purpose of demonstrating his righteousness, that he had to bear so much
suffering. But the language in which the Lord commends Job might also be applied to him
who “delights in the law of God after the inner man, whilst he sees another law in his
members warring against the law of his mind;”530 especially as he says, “The good that I
would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is
no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.”531 Observe how he too after the inward
man is separate from every evil work, because such work he does not himself effect, but the
evil which dwells in his flesh; and yet, since he does not have even that ability to delight in
the law of God except from the grace of God, he, as still in want of deliverance, exclaims,
“O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? God’s grace,
through Jesus Christ our Lord!”532</p>

<p>Now what must we say of Zacharias and Elisabeth, who are often alleged against us in
discussions on this question, except that there is clear evidence in the Scripture534 that
Zacharias was a man of eminent righteousness among the chief priests, whose duty it was
to offer up the sacrifices of the Old Testament? We also read, however, in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, in a passage which I have already quoted in my previous book,535 that Christ was
the only High Priest who had no need, as those who were called high priests, to offer daily
a sacrifice for his own sins first, and then for the people. “For such a High Priest,” it says,
“became us, righteous, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than
the heavens; who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his
own sins.”536 Amongst the priests here referred to was Zacharias, amongst them was
Phinehas, yea, Aaron himself, from whom this priesthood had its beginning, and whatever

<head>Chapter 20.—Paul Worthy to Be the Prince of the Apostles, and Yet a Sinner.</head>
<p>What commendation, however, is bestowed on Zacharias and Elisabeth which is not
comprehended in what the apostle has said about himself before he believed in Christ? He
said that, “as touching the righteousness which is in the law, he had been blameless.”537 The
same is said also of them: “They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments
and ordinances of the Lord blameless.”538 It was because whatever righteousness
they had in them was not a pretence before men that it is said accordingly, “They walked
before the Lord.” But that which is written of Zacharias and his wife in the phrase, in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord, the apostle briefly expressed by the words, in
the law. For there was not one law for him and another for them previous to the gospel. It
was one and the same law which, as we read, was given by Moses to their fathers, and according
to which, also, Zacharias was priest, and offered sacrifices in his course. And yet
the apostle, who was then endued with the like righteousness, goes on to say: “But what
things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things
but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; for whose sake I have
not only thought all things to be only detriments, but I have even counted them as dung,
that I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of
the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
faith: that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His
suffering, being made comformable unto His death; if by any means I might attain unto the
resurrection of the dead.”539 So far, then, is it from being true that we should, from the
words in which Scripture describes them, suppose that Zacharias and Elisabeth had a perfect
righteousness without any sin, that we must even regard the apostle himself, according to
the selfsame rule, as not perfect, not only in that righteousness of the law which he possessed
in common with them, and which he counts as loss and dung in comparison with that most
excellent righteousness which is by the faith of Christ, but also in the very gospel itself,
wherein he deserved the pre-eminence of his great apostleship. Now I would not venture
to say this if I did not deem it very wrong to refuse credence to himself. He extends the
passage which we have quoted, and says: “Not as though I had already attained, or were
already perfect; but I follow after, if I may comprehend that for which also I am apprehended
in Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do,
forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”540

Here he confesses that he has not yet attained, and is not yet perfect in that plenitude of
righteousness which he had longed to obtain in Christ; but that he was as yet pressing towards
the mark, and, forgetting what was past, was reaching out to the things which are before
him. We are sure, then, that what he says elsewhere is true even of himself: “Although our
outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.” 541 Although he was
already a perfect542 traveller, he had not yet attained the perfect end of his journey. All such
he would fain take with him as companions of his course. This he expresses in the words
which follow our former quotation: “Let as many, then, of us as are perfect, be thus minded:
and if ye be yet of another mind, God will reveal even this also to you. Nevertheless,
whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by that rule.”543 This “walk” is not performed
with the legs of the body, but with the affections of the soul and the character of the life, so
that they who possess righteousness may arrive at perfection, who, advancing in their renewal
day by day along the straight path of faith, have by this time become perfect as travellers in
the selfsame righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter 22 <del>XV.</del>—An Objection of the Pelagians; Perfection is Relative; He is Rightly
Said to Be Perfect in Righteousness Who Has Made Much Progress Therein.</head>
<p>“Well, but,” they say, “the Lord says, ‘Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect,’547—an injunction which He would not have given, if He had known that
what He enjoined was impracticable.” Now the present question is not whether it be possible
for any men, during this present life, to be without sin if they receive that perfection for the
purpose; for the question of possibility we have already discussed:548—but what we have
now to consider is, whether any man in fact achieves perfection. We have, however, already
recognised the fact that no man wills as much as the duty demands, as also the testimony
of the Scriptures, which we have quoted so largely above, declares. When, indeed, perfection
is ascribed to any particular person, we must look carefully at the thing in which it is ascribed.
For I have just above quoted a passage of the apostle, wherein he confesses that he was not
yet perfect in the attainment of righteousness which he desired; but still he immediately
adds, “Let as many of us as are perfect be thus minded.” Now he would certainly not have
uttered these two sentences if he had not been perfect in one thing, and not in another. For
instance, a man may be perfect as a scholar in the pursuit of wisdom: and this could not yet
be said of those to whom <del>the apostle</del> said, “I have fed you with milk, and not with meat:
for hitherto ye have not been able to bear it, neither are ye yet able;”549 whereas to those of
whom it could be said he says, “Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect,”—
meaning, of course, “perfect pupils” to be understood. It may happen, therefore, as
I have said, that a man may be already perfect as a scholar, though not as yet perfect as a
teacher of wisdom; may be perfect as a learner, though not as yet perfect as a doer of righteousness;
may be perfect as a lover of his enemies, though not as yet perfect in bearing their
wrong. 550 Even in the case of him who is so far perfect as to love all men, inasmuch as he
has attained even to the love of his enemies, it still remains a question whether he be perfect
in that love,—in other words, whether he so loves those whom he loves as is prescribed to
be exercised towards those to be loved, by the unchangeable love of truth. Whenever, then,
we read in the Scriptures of any man’s perfection, it must be carefully considered in what
it is asserted, since a man is not therefore to be understood as being entirely without sin
because he is described as perfect in some particular thing; although the term may also be
employed to show, not, indeed, that there is no longer any point left for a man to reach his
way to perfection, but that he has in fact advanced a very great way, and on that account
may be deemed worthy of the designation. Thus, a man may be said to be perfect in the

science of the law, even if there be still something unknown to him; and in the same manner
the apostle called men perfect, to whom he said at the same time, “Yet if in anything ye be
otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already
attained, let us walk by the same rule.”551</p>

<head>Chapter 23 <del>XXI.</del>—Why God Prescribes What He Knows Cannot Be Observed.</head>
<p>We must not deny that God commands that we ought to be so perfect in doing righteousness,
as to have no sin at all. Now that cannot be sin, whatever it may be, unless God
has enjoined that it shall not be. Why then, they ask, does He command what He knows no
man living will perform? In this manner it may also be asked, Why He commanded the first
human beings, who were only two, what He knew they would not obey? For it must not be
pretended that He issued that command, that some of us might obey it, if they did not; for,
that they should not partake of the fruit of the particular tree, God commanded them, and
none besides. Because, as He knew what amount of righteousness they would fail to perform,
so did He also know what righteous measures He meant Himself to adopt concerning them.
In the same way, then, He orders all men to commit no sin, although He knows beforehand
that no man will fulfil the command; in order that He may, in the case of all who impiously
and condemnably despise His precepts, Himself do what is just in their condemnation; and,
in the case of all who while obediently and piously pressing on in his precepts, though failing
to observe to the utmost all things which He has enjoined, do yet forgive others as they wish
to to be forgiven themselves, Himself do what is good in their cleansing. For how can forgiveness
be bestowed by God’s mercy on the forgiving, when there is no sin? or how prohibition
fail to be given by the justice of God, when there is sin?</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—An Objection of the Pelagians. The Apostle Paul Was Not Free From
Sin So Long as He Lived.</head>
<p>“But see,” say they, “how the apostle says, ‘I have fought a good fight, I have kept the
faith, I have finished my course: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness;’
552 which he would not have said if he had any sin.” It is for them, then, to explain
how he could have said this, when there still remained for him to encounter the great conflict,
the grievous and excessive weight of that suffering which he had just said awaited him.553
In order to finish his course, was there yet wanting only a small thing, when that in fact was
still left to suffer wherein would be a fiercer and more cruel foe? If, however, he uttered such
words of joy feeling sure and secure, because he had been made sure and secure by Him
who had revealed to him the imminence of his suffering, then he spoke these words, not in
the fulness of realization, but in the firmness of hope, and represents what he foresees is to
come as if it had already been done. If, therefore, he had added to those words the further
statement, “I have no longer any sin,” we must have understood him as even then speaking
of a perfection arising from a future prospect, not from an accomplished fact. For his having
no sin, which they suppose was completed when he spoke these words, pertained to the
finishing of his course; just in the same way as his triumphing over his adversary in the decisive
conflict of his suffering had also reference to the finishing of his course, although this
they must needs themselves allow remained yet to be effected, when he was speaking these
words. The whole of this, therefore, we declare to have been as yet awaiting its accomplishment,
at the time when the apostle, with his perfect trust in the promise of God, spoke of it
all as having been already realized. For it was in reference to the finishing of his course that
he forgave the sins of those who sinned against him, and prayed that his own sins might in
like manner be forgiven him; and it was in his most certain confidence in this promise of
the Lord, that he believed he should have no sin in that last end, which was still future, even
when in his trustfulness he spoke of it as already accomplished. Now, omitting all other
considerations, I wonder whether, when he uttered the words in which he is thought to
imply that he had no sin, that “thorn of the flesh” had been already removed from him, for
the taking away of which he had three times entreated the Lord, and had received this answer:
“My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”554 For
bringing so great a man to perfection, it was needful that that “messenger of Satan” should
not be taken away by whom he was therefore to be buffeted, “lest he should be unduly exalted
by the abundance of his revelations,”555 and is there then any man so bold as either to think

<head>Chapter 25.—God Punishes Both in Wrath and in Mercy.</head>
<p>Although there are some men who are so eminent in righteousness that God speaks to
them out of His cloudy pillar, such as “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel
among them that call upon His name,”556 the latter of whom is much praised for his piety
and purity in the Scriptures of truth, from his earliest childhood, in which his mother, to
accomplish her vow, placed him in God’s temple, and devoted him to the Lord as His servant;—
yet even of such men it is written, “Thou, O God, wast propitious unto them, though
Thou didst punish all their devices.”557 Now the children of wrath God punishes in anger;
whereas it is in mercy that He punishes the children of grace; since “whom He loveth He
correcteth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”558 However, there are no punishments,
no correction, no scourge of God, but what are owing to sin, except in the case of
Him who prepared His back for the smiter, in order that He might experience all things in
our likeness without sin, in order that He might be the saintly Priest of saints, making intercession
even for saints, who with no sacrifice of truth say each one even for himself, “Forgive
us our trespasses, even as we also forgive them that trespass against us.” 559 Wherefore even
our opponents in this controversy, whilst they are chaste in their life, and commendable in
character, and although they do not hesitate to do that which the Lord enjoined on the rich
man, who inquired of Him about the attainment of eternal life, after he had told Him, in
answer to His first question, that he had already fully kept every commandment in the
law,—that “if he wished to be perfect, he must sell all that he had and give to the poor, and
transfer his treasure to heaven;”560 yet they do not in any one instance venture to say that
they are without sin. But this, as we believe, they refrain from saying, with deceitful intent;
but if they are lying, in this very act they begin either to augment or commit sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 26 <del>XVII.</del> — (3)561 Why No One in This Life is Without Sin.</head>
<p><del>3d.</del>562 Let us now consider the point which I mentioned as our third inquiry. Since
by divine grace assisting the human will, man may possibly exist in this life without sin, why
does he not? To this question I might very easily and truthfully answer: Because men are
unwilling. But if I am asked why they are unwilling, we are drawn into a lengthy statement.
And yet, without prejudice to a more careful examination, I may briefly say this much: Men
are unwilling to do what is right, either because what is right is unknown to them, or because
it is unpleasant to them. For we desire a thing more ardently in proportion to the certainty
of our knowledge of its goodness, and the warmth of our delight in it. Ignorance, therefore,
and infirmity are faults which impede the will from moving either for doing a good work,
or for refraining from an evil one. But that what was hidden may come to light, and what
was unpleasant may be made agreeable, is of the grace of God which helps the wills of men;
and that they are not helped by it, has its cause likewise in themselves, not in God, whether
they be predestinated to condemnation, on account of the iniquity of their pride, or
whether they are to be judged and disciplined contrary to their very pride, if they are children
of mercy. Accordingly Jeremiah, after saying, “I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not
in himself, and that it belongeth not to any man to walk and direct his steps,”563 immediately
adds, “Correct me, O Lord, but with judgment, and not in Thine anger;”564 as much as to
say, I know that it is for my correction that I am too little assisted by Thee, for my footsteps
to be perfectly directed: but yet do not in this so deal with me as Thou dost in Thine anger,
when Thou dost determine to condemn the wicked; but as Thou dost in Thy judgment
whereby Thou dost teach Thy children not to be proud. Whence in another passage it is
said, “And Thy judgments shall help me.”565</p>

<head>Chapter 27.566—The Divine Remedy for Pride.</head>
<p>You cannot therefore attribute to God the cause of any human fault. For of all human
offences, the cause is pride. For the conviction and removal of this a great remedy comes
from heaven. God in mercy humbles Himself, descends from above, and displays to man,
lifted up by pride, pure and manifest grace in very manhood, which He took upon Himself
out of vast love for those who partake of it. For, not even did even this One, so conjoined
to the Word of God that by that conjunction he became at once the one Son of God and the
same One the one Son of man, act by the antecedent merits of His own will. It behoved
Him, without doubt, to be one; had there been two, or three, or more, if this could have
been done, it would not have come from the pure and simple gift of God, but from man’s
free will and choice.567 This, then, is especially commended to us; this, so far as I dare to
think, is the divine lesson especially taught and learned in those treasures of wisdom and
knowledge which are hidden in Christ. Every one of us, therefore, now knows, now does
not know—now rejoices, now does not rejoice—to begin, continue, and complete our good
work, in order that he may know that it is due not to his own will, but to the gift of God,
that he either knows or rejoices; and thus he is cured of vanity which elated him, and knows
how truly it is said not of this earth of ours, but spiritually, “The Lord will give kindness and
sweet grace, and our land shall yield her fruit.”568 A good work, moreover, affords greater
delight, in proportion as God is more and more loved as the highest unchangeable Good,
and as the Author of all good things of every kind whatever. And that God may be loved,
“His love is shed abroad in our hearts,” not by ourselves, but “by the Holy Ghost that is
given unto us.”569</p>

<p>Men, however, are laboring to find in our own will some good thing of our own,—not

speaking of men’s good works, “What hast thou that thou didst not receive? now, if thou
didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?”570 But, besides this,
even reason itself, which may be estimated in such things by such as we are, sharply restrains
every one of us in our investigations so as that we may not so defend grace as to seem to
take away free will, or, on the other hand, so assert free will as to be judged ungrateful to
the grace of God, in our arrogant impiety.571</p>

<p>Now, with reference to the passage of the apostle which I have quoted, some would
maintain it to mean that “whatever amount of good will a man has, must be attributed to
God on this account,—namely, because even this amount could not be in him if he were
not a human being. Now, inasmuch as he has from God alone the capacity of being any
thing at all, and of being human, why should there not be also attributed to God whatever
there is in him of a good will, which could not exist unless he existed in whom it is?” But in
this same manner it may also be said that a bad will also may be attributed to God as its
author; because even it could not exist in man unless he were a man in whom it existed; but
God is the author of his existence as man; and thus also of his bad will, which could have
no existence if it had not a man in whom it might exist. But to argue thus is blasphemy.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—All Will is Either Good, and Then It Loves Righteousness, or Evil,
When It Does Not Love Righteousness.</head>
<p>Unless, therefore, we obtain not simply determination of will, which is freely turned in
this direction and that, and has its place amongst those natural goods which a bad man may
use badly; but also a good will, which has its place among those goods of which it is impossible
to make a bad use:—unless the impossibility is given to us from God, I know not how to
defend what is said: “What hast thou that thou didst not receive?” For if we have from God
a certain free will, which may still be either good or bad; but the good will comes from
ourselves; then that which comes from ourselves is better than that which comes from Him.
But inasmuch as it is the height of absurdity to say this, they ought to acknowledge that we
attain from God even a good will. It would indeed be a strange thing if the will could so
stand in some mean as to be neither good nor bad; for we either love righteousness, and it
is good, and if we love it more, more good,—if less, it is less good; or if we do not love it at
all, it is not good. And who can hesitate to affirm that, when the will loves not righteousness
in any way at all, it is not only a bad, but even a wholly depraved will? Since therefore the
will is either good or bad, and since of course we have not the bad will from God, it remains
that we have of God a good will; else, I am ignorant, since our justification is from it, in
what other gift from Him we ought to rejoice. Hence, I suppose, it is written, “The will is
prepared of the Lord;”572 and in the Psalms, “The steps of a man will be rightly ordered by
the Lord, and His way will be the choice of his will;”573 and that which the apostle says, “For
it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.”574</p>

our turning to God is not possible, except He rouses and helps us, and this is good will,—what
have we that we have not received? But if we received, why do we glory as if we had not received?
Therefore, as “he that glorieth must glory in the Lord,”575 it comes from His mercy,
not their merit, that God wills to impart this to some, but from His truth that He wills not
to impart it to others. For to sinners punishment is justly due, because “the Lord God loveth
mercy and truth,”576 and “mercy and truth are met together;”577 and “all the paths of the
Lord are mercy and truth.”578 And who can tell the numberless instances in which Holy
Scripture combines these two attributes? Sometimes, by a change in the terms, grace is put
for mercy, as in the passage, “We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth.”579 Sometimes also judgment occurs instead of truth, as in

which illuminates their darkness, and the sweet grace which causes their land 582 to yield

<head>Chapter 33.—Through Grace We Have Both the Knowledge of Good, and the Delight
Which It Affords.</head>
<p>But when we pray Him to give us His help to do and accomplish righteousness, what
else do we pray for than that He would open what was hidden, and impart sweetness to that
which gave no pleasure? For even this very duty of praying to Him we have learned by His
grace, whereas before it was hidden; and by His grace have come to love it, whereas before
it gave us no pleasure,—so that “he who glorieth must glory not in himself, but in the Lord.”
To be lifted up, indeed, to pride, is the result of men’s own will, not of the operation of God;
for to such a thing God neither urges us nor helps us. There first occurs then in the will of
man a certain desire of its own power, to become disobedient through pride. If it were not
for this desire, indeed, there would be nothing difficult; and whenever man willed it, he
might refuse without difficulty. There ensued, however, out of the penalty which was justly
due such a defect, that henceforth it became difficult to be obedient unto righteousness; and
unless this defect were overcome by assisting grace, no one would turn to holiness; nor unless
it were healed by efficient grace would any one enjoy the peace of righteousness. But whose
grace is it that conquers and heals, but His to whom the prayer is directed: “Convert us, O
God of our salvation, and turn Thine anger away from us?”583 And both if He does this, He
does it in mercy, so that it is said of Him, “Not according to our sins hath He dealt with us,
nor hath He recompensed us according to our iniquities;”584 and when He refrains from
doing this to any, it is in judgment that He refrains. And who shall say to Him, “What hast
Thou done?” when with pious mind the saints sing to the praise of His mercy and judgment?
Wherefore even in the case of His saints and faithful servants He applies to them a tardier
cure in certain of their failings, in order that, while they are involved in these, a less pleasure
than is sufficient for the fulfilling of righteousness in all its perfection may be experienced
by them at any good they may achieve, whether hidden or manifest; so that in respect of
His most perfect rule of equity and truth “no man living can be justified in His sight.”585
He does not in His own self, indeed, wish us to fall under condemnation, but that we should
become humble; and He displays to us all the self-same grace of His own. Let us not, however,
after we have attained facility in all things, suppose that to be our own which is really His;
for that would be an error most antagonistic to religion and piety. Nor let us think that we
should, because of His grace, continue in the same sins as of old; but against that very pride,
on account of which we are humiliated in them, let us, above all things, both vigilantly strive
and ardently pray Him, knowing at the same time that it is by His gift that we have the power
thus to strive and thus to pray; so that in every case, while we look not at ourselves, but raise

<head>Chapter 34 <del>XX.</del>—(4) That No Man, with the Exception of Christ, Has Ever Lived,
or Can Live Without Sin.586</head>
<p><del>4th.</del> There now remains our fourth point, after the explanation of which, as God shall
help us, this lengthened treatise of ours may at last be brought to an end. It is this: Whether
the man who never has had sin or is to have it, not merely is now living as one of the sons
of men, but even could ever have existed at any time, or will yet in time to come exist? Now
it is altogether most certain that such a man neither does now live, nor has lived, nor ever
will live, except the one only Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus. We
have already said a good deal on this subject in our remarks on the baptism of infants; for
if these have no sin, not only are there at present, but also there have been, and there will
be, persons innumerable without sin. Now if the point which we treated of under the second
head be truly substantiated, that there is in fact no man without sin,587 then of course not
even infants are without sin. From which the conclusion arises, that even supposing a man
could possibly exist in the present life so far advanced in virtue as to have reached the perfect
fulness of holy living which is absolutely free from sin, he still must have been undoubtedly
a sinner previously, and have been converted from the sinful state to this subsequent newness
of life. Now when we were discussing the second head, a different question was before us
from that which is before us under this fourth head. For then the point we had to consider
was, Whether any man in this life could ever attain to such perfection as to be absolutely
without sin by the grace of God, by the hearty desire of his own will? whereas the question
now proposed in this fourth place is, Whether there be among the sons of men, or could
possibly ever have been, or yet ever can be, a man who has not indeed emerged out of sin
and attained to perfect righteousness, but has never, at any time whatever, been under the
bondage of sin? If, therefore, the remarks are true which we have made at so great length
concerning infants, there neither is, has been, nor will be, among the sons of men any such
man, except the one Mediator, in whom there accrues to us propitiation and justification
through which we have reconciliation with God, by the termination of the enmity produced
by our sins. It will therefore be not unsuitable to retrace a few considerations, so far as the
present subject seems to require, from the very commencement of the human race, in order
that they may inform and strengthen the reader’s mind in answer to some objections which
may possibly disturb him.</p>

<head>Chapter 35 <del>XXI.</del>—Adam and Eve; Obedience Most Strongly Enjoined by God on
Man.</head>
<p>When the first human beings—the one man Adam, and his wife Eve who came out of
him—willed not to obey the commandment which they had received from God, a just and
deserved punishment overtook them. The Lord had threatened that, on the day they ate the
forbidden fruit, they should surely die.588 Now, inasmuch as they had received the permission
of using for food every tree that grew in Paradise, among which God had planted the tree
of life, but had been forbidden to partake of one only tree, which He called the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, to signify by this name the consequence of their discovering
whether what good they would experience if they kept the prohibition, or what evil if they
transgressed it: they are no doubt rightly considered to have abstained from the forbidden
food previous to the malignant persuasion of the devil, and to have used all which had been
allowed them, and therefore, among all the others, and before all the others, the tree of life.
For what could be more absurd than to suppose that they partook of the fruit of other trees,
but not of that which had been equally with others granted to them, and which, by its especial
virtue, prevented even their animal bodies from undergoing change through the decay of
age, and from aging into death, applying this benefit from its own body to the man’s body,
and in a mystery demonstrating what is conferred by wisdom (which it symbolized) on the
rational soul, even that, quickened by its fruit, it should not be changed into the decay and
death of iniquity? For of her it is rightly said, “She is a tree of life to them that lay hold of
her.”589 Just as the one tree was for the bodily Paradise, the other is for the spiritual; the one
affording a vigour to the senses of the outward man, the other to those of the inner man,
such as will abide without any change for the worse through time. They therefore served
God, since that dutiful obedience was committed to them, by which alone God can be
worshipped. And it was not possible more suitably to intimate the inherent importance of
obedience, or its sole sufficiency securely to keep the rational creature under the Creator,
than by forbidding a tree which was not in itself evil. For God forbid that the Creator of
good things, who made all things, “and behold they were very good,”590 should plant anything
evil amidst the fertility of even that material Paradise. Still, however, in order that he might
show man, to whom submission to such a Master would be very useful, how much good
belonged simply to obedience (and this was all that He had demanded of His servant, and
this would be of advantage not so much for the lordship of the Master as for the profit of
the servant), they were forbidden the use of a tree, which, if it had not been for the prohibition,
they might have used without suffering any evil result whatever; and from this circum-

stance it may be clearly understood, that whatever evil they brought on themselves because
they made use of it in spite of the prohibition, the tree did not produce from any noxious
or pernicious quality in its fruit, but entirely on account of their violated obedience.</p>

<head>Chapter 36 <del>XXII.</del>—Man’s State Before the Fall.</head>
<p>Before they had thus violated their obedience they were pleasing to God, and God was
pleasing to them; and though they carried about an animal body, they yet felt in it no disobedience
moving against themselves. This was the righteous appointment, that inasmuch
as their soul had received from the Lord the body for its servant, as it itself obeyed the Lord,
even so its body should obey Him, and should exhibit a service suitable to the life given it
without resistance. Hence “they were both naked, and were not ashamed.”591 It is with a
natural instinct of shame that the rational soul is now indeed affected, because in that flesh,
over whose service it received the right of power, it can no longer, owing to some indescribable
infirmity, prevent the motion of the members thereof, notwithstanding its own unwillingness,
nor excite them to motion even when it wishes. Now these members are on this
account, in every man of chastity, rightly called “pudenda,”592 because they excite themselves,
just as they like, in opposition to the mind which is their master, as if they were their own
masters; and the sole authority which the bridle of virtue possesses over them is to check
them from approaching impure and unlawful pollutions. Such disobedience of the flesh as
this, which lies in the very excitement, even when it is not allowed to take effect, did not
exist in the first man and woman whilst they were naked and not ashamed. For not yet had
the rational soul, which rules the flesh, developed such a disobedience to its Lord, as by a
reciprocity of punishment to bring on itself the rebellion of its own servant the flesh, along
with that feeling of confusion and trouble to itself which it certainly failed to inflict upon
God by its own disobedience to Him; for God is put to no shame or trouble when we do
not obey Him, nor are we able in any wise to lessen His very great power over us; but we
are shamed in that the flesh is not submissive to our government,—a result which is brought
about by the infirmity which we have earned by sinning, and is called “the sin which dwelleth
in our members.”593 But this sin is of such a character that it is the punishment of sin. As
soon, indeed, as that transgression was effected, and the disobedient soul turned away from
the law of its Lord, then its servant, the body, began to cherish a law of disobedience against
it; and then the man and the woman grew ashamed of their nakedness, when they perceived
the rebellious motion of the flesh, which they had not felt before, and which perception is
called “the opening of their eyes;” 594 for, of course, they did not walk about among the trees
with closed eyes. The same thing is said of Hagar: “Her eyes were opened, and she saw a

for them as members, but they had made parts of shame.</p>

<head>Chapter 37 <del>XXIII.</del>—The Corruption of Nature is by Sin, Its Renovation is by Christ.</head>
<p>From this law of sin is born the flesh of sin, which requires cleansing through the sacrament
of Him who came in the likeness of sinful flesh, that the body of sin might be destroyed,
which is also called “the body of this death,” from which only God’s grace delivers wretched
man through Jesus Christ our Lord.596 For this law, the origin of death, passed on from the
first pair to their posterity, as is seen in the labour with which all men toil in the earth, and
the travail of women in the pains of childbirth. For these sufferings they merited by the
sentence of God, when they were convicted of sin; and we see them fulfilled not only in
them, but also in their descendants, in some more, in others less, but nevertheless in all.
Whereas, however, the primeval righteousness of the first human beings consisted in
obeying God, and not having in their members the law of their own concupiscence against
the law of their mind; now, since their sin, in our sinful flesh which is born of them, it is
obtained by those who obey God, as a great acquisition, that they do not obey the desires
of this evil concupiscence, but crucify in themselves the flesh with its affections and lusts,
in order that they may be Jesus Christ’s, who on His cross symbolized this, and who gave
them power through His grace to become the sons of God. For it is not to all men, but to
as many as have received Him, that He has given to be born again to God of the Spirit, after
they were born to the world by the flesh. Of these indeed it is written: “But as many as received
Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God; which were born, not of
the flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.”597</p>

Our Own Birth.</head>
<p>He goes on to add, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;”598 as much
as to say, A great thing indeed has been done among them, even that they are born again to
God of God, who had before been born of the flesh to the world, although created by God
Himself; but a far more wonderful thing has been done that, although it accrued to them
by nature to be born of the flesh, but by the divine goodness to be born of God,—in order
that so great a benefit might be imparted to them, He who was in His own nature born of
God, vouchsafed in mercy to be also born of the flesh;—no less being meant by the passage,
“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” Hereby, he says in effect, it has been
wrought that we who were born of the flesh as flesh, by being afterwards born of the Spirit,
may be spirit and dwell in God; because also God, who was born of God, by being afterwards
born of the flesh, became flesh, and dwelt among us. For the Word, which became flesh,
was in the beginning, and was God with God.599 But at the same time His participation in
our inferior condition, in order to our participation in His higher state, held a kind of medium600
in His birth of the flesh; so that we indeed were born in sinful flesh, but He was
born in the likeness of sinful flesh,—we not only of flesh and blood, but also of the will of
man, and of the flesh, but He was born only of flesh and blood, not of the will of man, nor
of the will of the flesh, but of God: we, therefore, to die on account of sin, He, to die on our
account without sin. So also, just as His inferior circumstances, into which He descended
to us, were not in every particular exactly the same with our inferior circumstances, in which
He found us here; so our superior state, into which we ascend to Him, will not be quite the
same with His superior state, in which we are there to find Him. For we by His grace are to
be made the sons of God, whereas He was evermore by nature the Son of God; we, when
we are converted, shall cleave to God, though not as His equals; He never turned from God,
and remains ever equal to God; we are partakers of eternal life, He is eternal life. He, therefore,
alone having become man, but still continuing to be God, never had any sin, nor did he assume
a flesh of sin, though born of a maternal601 flesh of sin. For what He then took of flesh,
He either cleansed in order to take it, or cleansed by taking it. His virgin mother, therefore,

<p>The answer, which we have already given,602 to those who say, “If a sinner has begotten
a sinner, a righteous man ought also to have begotten a righteous man,” we now advance
in reply to such as argue that one who is born of a baptized man ought himself to be regarded
as already baptized. “For why,” they ask, “could he not have been baptized in the loins of
his father, when, according to the Epistle to the Hebrews, Levi,603 was able to pay tithes in
the loins of Abraham?” They who propose this argument ought to observe that Levi did not
on this account subsequently not pay tithes, because he had paid tithes already in the loins
of Abraham, but because he was ordained to the office of the priesthood in order to receive
tithes, not to pay them; otherwise neither would his brethren, who all contributed their
tithes to him, have been tithed—because they too, whilst in the loins of Abraham, had already
paid tithes to Melchisedec.</p>

<p>And let no one contend that the descendants of Abraham might fairly enough have paid

tithes was an obligation of such a nature as to require constant repetition from each several
person, just as the Israelites used to pay such contributions every year all through life to
their Levites, to whom were due various tithes from all kinds of produce; whereas baptism
is a sacrament of such a nature as is administered once for all, and if one had already received
it when in his father, he must be considered as no other than baptized, since he was born
of a man who had been himself baptized. Well, whoever thus argues (I will simply say,
without discussing the point at length,) should look at circumcision, which was administered
once for all, and yet was administered to each person separately and individually. Just as
therefore it was necessary in the time of that ancient sacrament for the son of a circumcised
man to be himself circumcised, so now the son of one who has been baptized must himself
also receive baptism.</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—Children of Believers are Called “Clean” By the Apostle.604</head>
<p>The apostle indeed says, “Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy;”605
and “therefore” they infer “there was no necessity for the children of believers to be baptized.”
I am surprised at the use of such language by persons who deny that original sin has been
transmitted from Adam. For, if they take this passage of the apostle to mean that the children
of believers are born in a state of holiness, how is it that even they have no doubt about the
necessity of their being baptized? Why, in fine, do they refuse to admit that any original sin
is derived from a sinful parent, if some holiness is received from a holy parent? Now it certainly
does not contravene our assertion, even if from the faithful “holy” children are
propagated, when we hold that unless they are baptized those go into damnation, to whom
our opponents themselves shut the kingdom of heaven, although they insist that they are
without sin, whether actual or original.606 Or, if they think it an unbecoming thing for “holy
ones” to be damned, how can it be a becoming thing to exclude “holy ones” from the kingdom
of God? They should rather pay especial attention to this point, How can something sinful
help being derived from sinful parents, if something holy is derived from holy parents, and
uncleanness from unclean parents? For the twofold principle was affirmed when he said,
“Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.” They should also explain to us
how it is right that the holy children of believers and the unclean children of unbelievers
are, notwithstanding their different circumstances, equally prohibited from entering the
kingdom of God, if they have not been baptized. What avails that sanctity of theirs to the
one? Now if they were to maintain that the unclean children of unbelievers are damned,
but that the holy children of believers are unable to enter the kingdom of heaven unless they
are baptized,—but nevertheless are not damned, because they are “holy,”—that would be
some sort of a distinction; but as it is, they equally declare respecting the holy children of
holy parents and the unclean offspring of unclean parents, that they are not damned, since
they have not any sin; and that they are excluded from the kingdom of God because they
are unbaptized. What an absurdity! Who can suppose that such splendid geniuses do not
perceive it?</p>

<head>Chapter 42.—Sanctification Manifold; Sacrament of Catechumens.</head>
<p>Our opinions on this point are strictly in unison with the apostle’s himself, who said,
“From one all to condemnation,” and “from one all to justification of life.”607 Now how
consistent these statements are with what he elsewhere says, when treating of another point,
“Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy,” consider a while. <del>XXVI.</del> Sanctification
is not of merely one measure; for even catechumens, I take it, are sanctified in their
own measure by the sign of Christ, and the prayer of imposition of hands; and what they
receive is holy, although it is not the body of Christ,—holier than any food which constitutes
our ordinary nourishment, because it is a sacrament.608 However, that very meat and drink,
wherewithal the necessities of our present life are sustained, are, according to the same
apostle, “sanctified by the word of God and prayer,”609 even the prayer with which we beg
that our bodies may be refreshed. Just as therefore this sanctification of our ordinary food
does not hinder what enters the mouth from descending into the belly, and being ejected
into the draught,610 and partaking of the corruption into which everything earthly is resolved,
whence the Lord exhorts us to labour for the other food which never perishes:611 so the
sanctification of the catechumen, if he is not baptized, does not avail for his entrance into
the kingdom of heaven, nor for the remission of his sins. And, by parity of reasoning, that
sanctification likewise, of whatever measure it be, which, according to the apostle, is in the
children of believers, has nothing whatever to do with the question of baptism and of the
origin or the remission of sin.612 The apostle, in this very passage which has occupied our
attention, says that the unbeliever of a married couple is sanctified by a believing partner:
“For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified
by the husband. Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.”613 Now, I should
say, there is not a man whose mind is so warped by unbelief, as to suppose that, whatever
sense he gives to these words, they can possibly mean that a husband who is not a Christian
should not be baptized, because his wife is a Christian, and that he has already obtained re-

<head>Chapter 43 <del>XXVII.</del>—Why the Children of the Baptized Should Be Baptized.</head>
<p>If any man, however, is still perplexed by the question why the children of baptized
persons are baptized, let him briefly consider this: Inasmuch as the generation of sinful flesh
through the one man, Adam, draws into condemnation all who are born of such generation,
so the generation of the Spirit of grace through the one man Jesus Christ, draws to the justification
of eternal life all who, because predestinated, partake of this regeneration. But the
sacrament of baptism is undoubtedly the sacrament of regenation: Wherefore, as the man
who has never lived cannot die, and he who has never died cannot rise again, so he who has
never been born cannot be born again. From which the conclusion arises, that no one who
has not been born could possibly have been born again in his father. Born again, however,
a man must be, after he has been born; because, “Except a man be born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God”614 Even an infant, therefore, must be imbued with the sacrament
of regeneration, lest without it his would be an unhappy exit out of this life; and this baptism
is not administered except for the remission of sins. And so much does Christ show us in
this very passage; for when asked, How could such things be? He reminded His questioner
of what Moses did when he lifted up the serpent. Inasmuch, then, as infants are by the sacrament
of baptism conformed to the death of Christ, it must be admitted that they are also
freed from the serpent’s poisonous bite, unless we wilfully wander from the rule of the
Christian faith. This bite, however, they did not receive in their own actual life, but in him
on whom the wound was primarily inflicted.</p>

<head>Chapter 44.—An Objection of the Pelagians.</head>
<p>Nor do they fail to see this point, that his own sins are no detriment to the parent after
his conversion; they therefore raise the question: “How much more impossible is it that they
should be a hinderance to his son?” But they who thus think do not attend to this consideration,
that as his own sins are not injurious to the father for the very reason that he is born
again of the Spirit, so in the case of his son, unless he be in the same manner born again,
the sins which he derived from his father will prove injurious to him. Because even renewed
parents beget children, not out of the first-fruits of their renewed condition, but carnally
out of the remains of the old nature; and the children who are thus the offspring of their
parents’ remaining old nature, and are born in sinful flesh, escape from the condemnation
which is due to the old man by the sacrament of spiritual regeneration and renewal. Now
this is a consideration which, on account of the controversies that have arisen, and may still
arise, on this subject, we ought to keep in our view and memory,—that a full and perfect
remission of sins takes place only in baptism, that the character of the actual man does not
at once undergo a total change, but that the first-fruits of the Spirit in such as walk worthily
change the old carnal nature into one of like character by a process of renewal, which increases
day by day, until the entire old nature is so renovated that the very weakness of the
natural body attains to the strength and incorruptibility of the spiritual body.</p>

<head>Chapter 45 <del>XXVIII.</del>—The Law of Sin is Called Sin; How Concupiscence Still Remains
After Its Evil Has Been Removed in the Baptized.</head>
<p>This law of sin, however, which the apostle also designates “sin,” when he says, “Let not
sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof,”615 does
not so remain in the members of those who are born again of water and the Spirit, as if no
remission thereof has been made, because there is a full and perfect remission of our sins,
all the enmity being slain, which separated us from God; but it remains in our old carnal
nature, as if overcome and destroyed, if it does not, by consenting to unlawful objects,
somehow revive, and recover its own reign and dominion. There is, however, so clear a
distinction to be seen between this old carnal nature, in which the law of sin, or sin, is already
repealed, and that life of the Spirit, in the newness of which they who are baptized are through
God’s grace born again, that the apostle deemed it too little to say of such that they were
not in sin; unless he also said that they were not in the flesh itself, even before they departed
out of this mortal life. “They that are in the flesh,” says he, “cannot please God; but ye are
not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.”616 And indeed,
as they turn to good account the flesh itself, however corruptible it be, who apply its members
to good works, and no longer are in that flesh, since they do not mould their understanding
nor their life according to its principles; and as they in like manner make even a good use
of death, which is the penalty of the first sin, who encounter it with fortitude and patience
for their brethren’s sake, and for the faith, and in defence of whatever is true and holy and
just,—so also do all “true yokefellows” in the faith turn to good account that very law of sin
which still remains, though remitted, in their old carnal nature, who, because they have the
new life in Christ, do not permit lust to have dominion over them. And yet these very persons,
because they still carry about Adam’s old nature, mortally generate children to be immortally
regenerated, with that propagation of sin, in which such as are born again are not held
bound, and from which such as are born are released by being born again. As long, then, as
the law by concupiscence617 dwells in the members, although it remains, the guilt of it is
released; but it is released only to him who has received the sacrament of regeneration, and
has already begun to be renewed. But whatsoever is born of the old nature, which still abides
with its concupiscence, requires to be born again in order to be healed. Seeing that believing
parents, who have been both carnally born and spiritually born again, have themselves begotten
children in a carnal manner, how could their children by any possibility, previous
to their first birth, have been born again?</p>

<head>Chapter 46.618—Guilt May Be Taken Away But Concupiscence Remain.</head>
<p>You must not be surprised at what I have said, that although the law of sin remains with
its concupiscence, the guilt thereof is done away through the grace of the sacrament. For as
wicked deeds, and words, and thoughts have already passed away, and cease to exist, so far
as regards the mere movements of the mind and the body, and yet their guilt remains after
they have passed away and no longer exist, unless it be done away by the remission of sins;
so, contrariwise, in this law of concupiscence, which is not yet done away but still remains,
its guilt is done away, and continues no longer, since in baptism there takes place a full forgiveness
of sins. Indeed, if a man were to quit this present life immediately after his baptism,
there would be nothing at all left to hold him liable, inasmuch as all which held him is released.
As, on the one hand, therefore, there is nothing strange in the fact that the guilt of
past sins of thought, and word, and deed remains before their remission; so, on the other
hand, there ought to be nothing to create surprise, that the guilt of remaining concupiscence
passes away after the remission of sin.</p>

<p>This being the case, ever since the time when by one man sin thus entered into this
world and death by sin, and so it passed through to all men, up to the end of this carnal
generation and perishing world, the children of which beget and are begotten, there never
has existed, nor ever will exist, a human being of whom, placed in this life of ours, it could
be said that he had no sin at all, with the exception of the one Mediator, who reconciles us
to our Maker through the forgiveness of sins. Now this same Lord of ours has never yet refused,
at any period of the human race, nor to the last judgment will He ever refuse, this
His healing to those whom, in His most sure foreknowledge and future loving-kindness,
He has predestinated to reign with Himself to life eternal. For, previous to His birth in the
flesh, and weakness in suffering, and power in His own resurrection, He instructed all who
then lived, in the faith of those then future blessings, that they might inherit everlasting life;
whilst those who were alive when all these things were being accomplished in Christ, and
who were witnessing the fulfilment of prophecy, He instructed in the faith of these then
present blessings; whilst again, those who have since lived, and ourselves who are now alive,
and all those who are yet to live, He does not cease to instruct, in the faith of these now past
blessings. It is therefore “one faith” which saves all, who after their carnal birth are born
again of the Spirit, and it terminates in Him, who came to be judged for us and to die,—the
Judge of quick and dead. But the sacraments of this “one faith” are varied from time to time
in order to its suitable signification.</p>

<head>Chapter 48.—Christ the Saviour Even of Infants; Christ, When an Infant, Was Free
from Ignorance and Mental Weakness.</head>
<p>He is therefore the Saviour at once of infants and of adults, of whom the angel said,
“There is born unto you this day a Saviour;”619 and concerning whom it was declared to
the Virgin Mary,620 “Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their
sins,” where it is plainly shown that He was called Jesus because of the salvation which He
bestows upon us,—Jesus being tantamount to the Latin Salvator, “Saviour.” Who then can
be so bold as to maintain that the Lord Christ is Jesus only for adults and not for infants
also? who came in the likeness of sinful flesh, to destroy the body of sin, with infants’ limbs
fitted and suitable for no use in the extreme weakness of such body, and His rational soul
oppressed with miserable ignorance! Now that such entire ignorance existed, I cannot suppose
in the infant in whom the Word was made flesh, that He might dwell among us; nor can I
imagine that such weakness of the mental faculty ever existed in the infant Christ which we
see in infants generally. For it is owing to such infirmity and ignorance that infants are disturbed
with irrational affections, and are restrained by no rational command or government,
but by pains and penalties, or the terror of such; so that you can quite see that they are
children of that disobedience, which excites itself in the members of our body in opposition
to the law of the mind,—and refuses to be still, even when the reason wishes; nay, often is
either repressed only by some actual infliction of bodily pain, as for instance by flogging;
or is checked only by fear, or by some such mental emotion, but not by any admonishing
of the will. Inasmuch, however, as in Him there was the likeness of sinful flesh, He willed
to pass through the changes of the various stages of life, beginning even with infancy, so
that it would seem as if even His flesh might have arrived at death by the gradual approach
of old age, if He had not been killed while young. Nevertheless, the death is inflicted in sinful
flesh as the due of disobedience, but in the likeness of sinful flesh it was undergone in voluntary
obedience. For when He was on His way to it, and was soon to suffer it, He said,
“Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. But that all may know
that I am doing my Father’s will, arise, let us go hence.”621 Having said these words, He
went straightway, and encountered His undeserved death, having become obedient even
unto death.</p>

<p>They therefore who say, “If through the sin of the first man it was brought about that
we must die, by the coming of Christ it should be brought about that, believing in Him, we
shall not die;” and they add what they deem a reason, saying, “For the sin of the first transgressor
could not possibly have injured us more than the incarnation or redemption of the
Saviour has benefited us.” But why do they not rather give an attentive ear, and an unhesitating
belief, to that which the apostle has stated so unambiguously: “Since by man came
death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in
Christ shall all be made alive?”622 For it is of nothing else than of the resurrection of the
body that he was speaking. Having said that the bodily death of all men has come about
through one man, he adds the promise that the bodily resurrection of all men to eternal life
shall happen through one, even Christ. How can it therefore be that “the one has injured
us more by sinning than the other has benefited us by redeeming,” when by the sin of the
former we die a temporal death, but by the redemption of the latter we rise again not to a
temporal, but to a perpetual life? Our body, therefore, is dead because of sin, but Christ’s
body only died without sin, in order that, having poured out His blood without fault, “the
bonds”623 which contain the register of all faults “might be blotted out,” by which they who
now believe in Him were formerly held as debtors by the devil. And accordingly He says,
“This is my blood, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.”624</p>

<head>Chapter 50 <del>XXXI.</del>—Why It is that Death Itself is Not Abolished, Along with Sin,
by Baptism.</head>
<p>He might, however, have also conferred this upon believers, that they should not even
experience the death of their body. But if He had done this, there might no doubt have been
added a certain felicity to the flesh, but the fortitude of faith would have been diminished;
for men have such a fear of death, that they would declare Christians happy, for nothing
else than their mere immunity from dying. And no one would, for the sake of that life which
is to be so happy after death, hasten to the grace of Christ by the power of his contempt of
death itself; but with a view to remove the trouble of death, would rather resort to a more
delicate mode of believing in Christ. More grace, therefore, than this has He conferred on
those who believe on Him; and a greater gift, undoubtedly, has He vouchsafed to them!
What great matter would it have been for a man, on seeing that people did not die when
they became believers, himself also to believe that he was not to die? How much greater a
thing is it, how much braver, how much more laudable, so to believe, that although one is
sure to die, he can still hope to live hereafter for evermore! At last, upon some there will be
bestowed this blessing at the last day, that they shall not feel death itself in sudden change,
but shall be caught up along with the risen in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so
shall they ever live with the Lord.625 And rightly shall it be these who receive this grace,
since there will be no posterity after them to be led to believe, not by the hope of what they
see not, but by the love of what they see. This faith is weak and nerveless, and must not be
called faith at all, inasmuch as faith is thus defined: “Faith is the firmness of those who
hope,626 the clear proof of things which they do not see.”627 Accordingly, in the same Epistle
to the Hebrews, where this passage occurs, after enumerating in subsequent sentences certain
worthies who pleased God by their faith, he says: “These all died in faith, not having received
the promises, but seeing them afar off, and hailing them, and confessing that they were
strangers and pilgrims on the earth.”628 And then afterwards he concluded his eulogy on
faith in these words: “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, did not
indeed receive God’s promises; for they foresaw better things for us, and that without us
they could not themselves become perfect.”629 Now this would be no praise for faith, nor
(as I said) would it be faith at all, were men in believing to follow after rewards which they

<head>Chapter 51.—Why the Devil is Said to Hold the Power and Dominion of Death.</head>
<p>Hence the Lord Himself willed to die, “in order that,” as it is written of Him, “through
death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them
who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.”630 From this passage
it is shown with sufficient clearness that even the death of the body came about by the instigation
and work of the devil,—in a word, from the sin which he persuaded man to commit;
nor is there any other reason why he should be said in strictness of truth to hold the power
of death. Accordingly, He who died without any sin, original or actual, said in the passage
I have already quoted: “Behold, the prince of this world,” that is, the devil, who had the
power of death, “cometh and findeth nothing in me,”—meaning, he shall find no sin in me,
because of which he has caused men to die. As if the question were asked Him: Why then
should you die? He says, “That all may know that I am doing the will of my Father, arise,
let us go hence;”631 that is, that I may die, though I have no cause of death from sin under
the author of sin, but only from obedience and righteousness, having become obedient unto
death. Proof is likewise afforded us by this passage, that the fact of the faithful overcoming
the fear of death is a part of the struggle of faith itself; for all struggle would indeed be at an
end, if immortality were at once to become the reward of them that believe.</p>

<head>Chapter 52 <del>XXXII.</del>—Why Christ, After His Resurrection, Withdrew His Presence
from the World.</head>
<p>Although, therefore, the Lord wrought many visible miracles in order that faith might
sprout at first and be fed by infant nourishment, and grow to its full strength by and by out
of this softness (for as faith becomes stronger the less does it seek such help); He nevertheless
wished us to wait quietly, without visible inducements, for the promised hope, in order that
“the just might live by faith;”632 and so great was this wish of His, that though He rose from
the dead the third day, He did not desire to remain among men, but, after leaving a proof
of his resurrection by showing Himself in the flesh to those whom He deigned to have for
His witnesses of this event, He ascended into heaven, withdrawing Himself thus from their
sight, and conferring no such thing on the flesh of any one of them as He had displayed in
His own flesh, in order that they too “might live by faith,” and in the present world might
wait in patience and without visible inducements for the reward of that righteousness in
which men live by faith,—a reward which should hereafter be visibly and openly bestowed.
To this signification I believe that passage must be referred which He speaks concerning
the Holy Ghost: “He will not come, unless I depart.”633 For this was in fact saying Ye shall
not be able to live righteously by faith, which ye shall have as a gift of mine,—that is, from
the Holy Ghost,—unless I withdraw from your eyes that which ye now gaze upon, in order
that your heart may advance in spiritual growth by fixing its faith on invisible things. This
righteousness of faith He constantly commends to them. Speaking of the Holy Ghost, He
says, “He shall reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because
they have not believed on me: of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye shall see
me no more.”634 What is that righteousness, whereby men were not to see Him, except that
“the just is to live by faith,” and that we, not looking at the things which are seen, but at
those which are not seen, are to wait in the Spirit for the hope of the righteousness that is
by faith?</p>

<p>But those persons who say, “If the death of the body has happened by sin, we of course
ought not to die after that remission of sins which the Redeemer has bestowed upon us,”
do not understand how it is that some things, whose guilt God has cancelled in order that
they may not stand in our way after this life, He yet permits to remain for the contest of
faith, in order that they may become the means of instructing and exercising those who are
advancing in the struggle after holiness. Might not some man, by not understanding this,
raise a question and ask, If God has said to man because of his sin, “In the sweat of thy brow
thou shall eat thy bread: thorns also and thistles shall the ground bring forth to thee,”635
how comes it to pass that this labour and toil continues since the remission of sins, and that
the ground of believers yields them this rough and terrible harvest? Again, since it was said
to the woman in consequence of her sin, “In sorrow shall thou bring forth children,”636
how is it that believing women, notwithstanding the remission of their sins, suffer the same
pains in the process of parturition? And nevertheless it is an incontestable fact, that by
reason of the sin which they had committed, the primeval man and woman heard these
sentences pronounced by God, and deserved them; nor does any one resist these words of
the sacred volume, which I have quoted about man’s labour and woman’s travail, unless

<head>Chapter 54 <del>XXXIV.</del>—Why Punishment is Still Inflicted, After Sin Has Been Forgiven.</head>
<p>But, inasmuch as there are not wanting persons of such character, just as we say in answer
to those who raise this question, that those things are punishments of sins before remission,
which after remission become contests and exercises of the righteous; so again to such persons
as are similarly perplexed about the death of the body, our answer ought to be so drawn as
to show both that we acknowledge it to have accrued because of sin, and that we are not
discouraged by the punishment of sins having been bequeathed to us for an exercise of discipline,
in order that our great fear of it may be overcome by us as we advance in holiness.
For if only small virtue accrued to “the faith which worketh by love” in conquering the fear
of death, there would be no great glory for the martyrs; nor could the Lord say, “Greater
love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends;”637 which John in his
epistle expresses in these terms: “As He laid down His life for us, so ought we to lay down
our lives for the brethren.”638 In vain, therefore, would commendation be bestowed on the
most eminent suffering in encountering or despising death for righteousness’ sake, if there
were not in death itself a really great and very severe trial. And the man who overcomes the
fear of it by his faith, procures a great glory and just recompense for his faith itself. Wherefore
it ought to surprise no one, either that the death of the body could not possibly have happened
to man unless sin had been previously committed, since it was of this that it was to become
the punishment; nor that after the remission of their sins it comes to the faithful, in order
that in their triumphing over the fear of it, the fortitude of righteousness may be exercised.</p>

<head>Chapter 55.—To Recover the Righteousness Which Had Been Lost by Sin, Man Has
to Struggle, with Abundant Labour and Sorrow.</head>
<p>The flesh which was originally created was not that sinful flesh in which man refused
to maintain his righteousness amidst the delights of Paradise, wherefore God determined
that sinful flesh should propagate itself after it had sinned, and struggle for the recovery of
holiness, in many toils and troubles. Therefore, after Adam was driven out of Paradise, he
had to dwell over against Eden,—that is, over against the garden of delights,—to indicate
that it is by labours and sorrows, which are the very contraries of delights, that sinful flesh
had to be educated, after it had failed amidst its first pleasures to maintain its holiness,
previous to its becoming sinful flesh. As therefore our first parents, by their subsequent return
to righteous living, by which they are supposed to have been released from the worst penalty
of their sentence through the blood of the Lord, were still not deemed worthy to be recalled
to Paradise during their life on earth, so in like manner our sinful flesh, even if a man lead
a righteous life in it after the remission of his sins, does not deserve to be immediately exempted
from that death which it has derived from its propagation of sin.639</p>

<p>Some such thought has occurred to us about the patriarch David, in the Book of Kings.
After the prophet was sent to him, and threatened him with the evils which were to arise
from the anger of God on account of the sin which he had committed, he obtained pardon
by the confession of his sin, and the prophet replied that the shame and crime had been remitted
to him; but yet, for all that, the evils with which God had threatened him followed
in due course, so that he was brought low by his son. Now why is not an objection at once
raised here: “If it was on account of his sin that God threatened him, why, when the sin was
forgiven, did He fulfil His threat?” except because, if the cavil had been raised, it would have
been most correctly answered, that the remission of the sin was given that the man might
not be hindered from gaining the life eternal, but the threatened evil was still carried into
effect, in order that the man’s piety might be exercised and approved in the lowly condition
to which he was reduced. Thus also God has both inflicted on man the death of his body,
because of his sin, and, after his sins are forgiven, has not released him in order that he may
be exercised in righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter 57 <del>XXXV.</del>—Turn to Neither Hand.</head>
<p>Let us hold fast, then, the confession of this faith, without faltering or failure. One alone
is there who was born without sin, in the likeness of sinful flesh, who lived without sin amid
the sins of others, and who died without sin on account of our sins. “Let us turn neither to
the right hand nor to the left.”640 For to turn to the right hand is to deceive oneself, by saying
that we are without sin; and to turn to the left is to surrender oneself to one’s sins with a
sort of impunity, in I know not how perverse and depraved a recklessness. “God indeed
knoweth the ways on the right hand,”641 even He who alone is without sin, and is able to
blot out our sins; “but the ways on the left hand are perverse,”642 in friendship with sins.
Of such inflexibility were those youths of twenty years,643 who foretokened in figure God’s
new people; they entered the land of promise; they, it is said, turned neither to the right
hand nor to the left.644 Now this age of twenty is not to be compared with the age of children’s
innocence, but if I mistake not, this number is the shadow and echo of a mystery. For the
Old Testament has its excellence in the five books of Moses, while the New Testament is
most refulgent in the authority of the four Gospels. These numbers, when multiplied together,
reach to the number twenty: four times five, or five times four, are twenty. Such a people
(as I have already said), instructed in the kingdom of heaven by the two Testaments—the
Old and the New—turning neither to the right hand, in a proud assumption of righteousness,
nor to the left hand, in a reckless delight in sin, shall enter into the land of promise, where
we shall have no longer either to pray that sins may be forgiven to us, or to fear that they
may be punished in us, having been freed from them all by that Redeemer, who, not being
“sold under sin,”645 “hath redeemed Israel out of all his iniquities,”646 whether committed
in the actual life, or derived from the original transgression.</p>

<p>It is no small concession to the authority and truthfulness of the inspired pages which
those persons have made, who, although unwilling to admit openly in their writings that
remission of sins is necessary for infants, have yet confessed that they need redemption.
Nothing that they have said differs indeed from another word, even that which is derived
from Christian instruction. Whilst by those who faithfully read, faithfully hear, and faithfully
hold fast the Holy Scriptures, it cannot be doubted that from that flesh, which first became
sinful flesh by the choice of sin, and which has been subsequently transmitted to all through
successive generations, there has been propagated a sinful flesh, with the single exception
of that “likeness of sinful flesh,”647—which likeness, however, there could not have been,
had there not been also the reality of sinful flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter 59.—Whether the Soul is Propagated; On Obscure Points, Concerning
Which the Scriptures Give Us No Assistance, We Must Be on Our Guard Against
Forming Hasty Judgments and Opinions; The Scriptures are Clear Enough on
Those Subjects Which are Necessary to Salvation.</head>
<p>Concerning the soul, indeed, the question arises, whether it, too, is propagated in the
same way <del>as the flesh,</del> and bound by the same guilt, which is forgiven to it—for we cannot
say that it is only the flesh of the infant, and not his soul also, which requires the help of a
Saviour and Redeemer, or that the latter must not be included in that thanksgiving in the
Psalms, where we read and repeat, “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits;
who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from
destruction.”648 Or if it be not likewise propagated, we may ask, whether, by the very fact
of its being mingled with and weighed down by the sinful flesh, it still has need of the remission
of its own sin, and of a redemption of its own, God being judge, in the height of His
foreknowledge,649 what infants do not deserve650 to be absolved from that guilt, even before
they are born, or have in any instance ever done anything good or evil. The question also
arises, how God (even if He does not create souls by natural propagation) can yet not be
the Author of that very guilt, on account of which redemption by the sacrament is necessary
to the infant’s soul. The subject is a wide and important one,651 and requires another treatise.
The discussion, however, so far as I can judge, ought to be conducted with temper and
moderation, so as to deserve the praise of cautious inquiry, rather than the censure of
headstrong assertion. For whenever a question arises on an unusually obscure subject, on
which no assistance can be rendered by clear and certain proofs of the Holy Scriptures, the
presumption of man ought to restrain itself; nor should it attempt anything definite by
leaning to either side. But if I must indeed be ignorant concerning any points of this sort,
as to how they can be explained and proved, this much I should still believe, that from this
very circumstance the Holy Scriptures would possess a most clear authority, whenever a
point arose which no man could be ignorant of, without imperilling the salvation which has
been promised him. You have now before you, [my dear Marcellinus,] this treatise, worked
out to the best of my ability. I only wish that its value equalled its length; for its length I
might probably be able to justify, only I should fear that, by adding the justification, I should
stretch the prolixity beyond your endurance.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—Pelagius Esteemed a Holy Man; His Expositions on Saint Paul.</head>
<p>The questions which you proposed that I should write to you about, in opposition to
those persons who say that Adam would have died even if he had not sinned, and that
nothing of his sin has passed to his posterity by natural transmission; and especially on the
subject of the baptism of infants, which the universal Church, with most pious and maternal
care, maintains in constant celebration; and whether in this life there are, or have been, or
ever will be, children of men without any sin at all—I have already discussed in two lengthy
books. And I venture to think that if in them I have not met all the points which perplex all
men’s minds on such matters (an achievement which, I apprehend,—nay, which I have no
doubt,—lies beyond the power either of myself, or of any other person), I have at all events
prepared something in the shape of a firm ground on which those who defend the faith delivered
to us by our fathers, against the novel opinions of its opponents, may at any time
take their stand, not unarmed for the contest. However, within the last few days I have read
some writings by Pelagius,—a holy man, as I am told, who has made no small progress in
the Christian life,—containing some very brief expository notes on the epistles of the Apostle
Paul;652 and therein I found, on coming to the passage where the apostle says, “By one man
sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it passed upon all men,”653 an argument
which is used by those who say that infants are not burdened with original sin. Now I confess
that I have not refuted this argument in my lengthy treatise, because it did not indeed once
occur to me that anybody was capable of thinking such sentiments. Being, however, unwilling
to add to that work, which I had concluded, I have thought it right to insert in this epistle
both the argument itself in the very words in which I read it, and the answer which it seems
to me proper to give to it.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—Pelagius’ Objection; Infants Reckoned Among the Number of Believers
and the Faithful.</head>
<p>In these terms, then, the argument is stated:—“But they who deny the transmission of
sin endeavour to impugn it thus: If (say they) Adam’s sin injured even those who do not
sin, therefore Christ’s righteousness also profits even those who do not believe; because ‘In
like manner, nay, much more,’ he says, ‘are men saved by one, than they had previously
perished by one.’” Now to this argument, I repeat, I advanced no reply in the two books
which I previously addressed to you; nor, indeed, had I proposed to myself such a task. But
now I beg you first of all to observe, when they say, “If Adam’s sin injures even those who
do not sin, then Christ’s righteousness also profits even those who do not believe,” how
absurd and false they judge it to be, that the righteousness of Christ should profit even those
who do not believe; and that thence they think to put together such an argument as this:
That no more could the first man’s sin possibly do injury to infants who commit no sin,
than the righteousness of Christ can benefit any who do not believe. Let them therefore tell
us what is the benefit of Christ’s righteousness to baptized infants; let them by all means tell
us what they mean. For of course, since they do not forget that they are Christians themselves,
they have no doubt that there is some benefit. But whatever be this benefit, it is incapable
(as they themselves assert) of benefiting those who do not believe. Whence they are compelled
to class baptized infants in the number of believers, and to assent to the authority of the
Holy Universal Church, which does not account those unworthy of the name of believers,
to whom the righteousness of Christ could be, according to them, of no use except as believers.
As, therefore, by the answer of those, through whose agency they are born again, the
Spirit of righteousness transfers to them that faith which, of their own will, they could not
yet have; so the sinful flesh of those, through whose agency they are born, transfers to them
that injury, which they have not yet contracted in their own life. And even as the Spirit of
life regenerates them in Christ as believers, so also the body of death had generated them
in Adam as sinners. The one generation is carnal, the other Spiritual; the one makes children
of the flesh, the other children of the Spirit; the one children of death, the other children of
the resurrection; the one the children of the world, the other the children of God; the one
children of wrath, the other children of mercy; and thus the one binds them under original
sin, the other liberates them from the bond of every sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Pelagius Makes God Unjust.</head>
<p>We are driven at last to yield our assent on divine authority to that which we are unable
to investigate with even the clearest intellect. It is well that they remind us themselves that
Christ’s righteousness is unable to profit any but believers, while they yet allow that it
somewhat profits infants; according to this (as we have already said) they must, without
evasion, find room for baptized infants among the number of believers. Consequently, if
they are not baptized, they will have to rank amongst those who do not believe; and therefore
they will not even have life, but “the wrath of God abideth on them,” inasmuch as “he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him;”654 and they
are under judgment, since “he that believeth not is condemned already;”655 and they shall
be condemned, since “he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth
not shall be damned.”656 Let them, now, then see to it with what justice they can hold or
strive to maintain that human beings have no part in eternal life, but in the wrath of God,
and incur the divine judgment and condemnation, who are without sin; if, that is, as they
cannot have any actual sin, so also they have within them no original sin.</p>

<p>To the other points which Pelagius makes them urge who argue against original sin, I

and request the favour of their coming to terms with those who perhaps censure my

<head>Chapter 5 <del>III.</del>—Pelagius Praised by Some; Arguments Against Original Sin Proposed

<p>But we must not indeed omit to observe that this good and praiseworthy man (as they
who know him describe him to be) has not advanced this argument against the natural
transmission of sin in his own person, but has reproduced what is alleged by those persons
who disapprove of the doctrine, and this, not merely so far as I have just quoted and confuted
the allegation, but also as to those other points on which I have now further undertaken to
furnish a reply. Now, after saying, “If (they say) Adam’s sin injured even those who do not
sin, therefore Christ’s righteousness also profits even those who do not believe,”—which
sentence, you will perceive from what I have said in answer to it, is not only not repugnant
to what we hold, but even reminds us what we ought to hold,—he at once goes on to add,
“Then they contend, if baptism cleanses away that old sin, those children who are born of
two baptized parents must needs be free from this sin, for they could not have transmitted
to their children what they did not possess themselves. Besides,” says he, “if the soul is not
of transmission, but only the flesh, then only the latter has the transmission of sin, and it
alone deserves punishment; for they allege that it would be unjust for the soul, which is only
now born, and comes not of the lump of Adam, to bear the burden of so old an alien sin.
They say, likewise,” says Pelagius, “that it cannot by any means be conceded that God, who
remits to a man his own sins, should impute to him another’s.”</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Why Pelagius Does Not Speak in His Own Person.</head>
<p>Pray, don’t you see how Pelagius has inserted the whole of this paragraph in his writings,
not in his own person, but in that of others, knowing so well the novelty of this unheard-of
doctrine, which is now beginning to raise its voice against the ancient ingrafted opinion of
the Church, that he was ashamed or afraid to acknowledge it himself? And perhaps he does
not himself think that a man is born without sin for whom he confesses that baptism to be
necessary by which comes the remission of sins; or that the man is condemned without sin
who must be reckoned, when unbaptized, in the class of non-believers, since the gospel of
course cannot deceive us, when it most clearly asserts, “He that believeth not shall be
damned;”658 or, lastly, that the image of God, when without sin, is not admitted into the
kingdom of God, forasmuch as “except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God,”659—and so must either be precipitated into eternal death
without sin, or, what is still more absurd, must have eternal life outside the kingdom of God;
for the Lord, when foretelling what He should say to His people at last,—“Come, ye blessed
of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the
world,”660—also clearly indicated what the kingdom was of which He was speaking, by
concluding thus: “So these shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into
life eternal.”661 These opinions, then, and others which spring from the central error, I believe
so worthy a man, and so good a Christian, does not at all accept, as being too perverse and
repugnant to Christian truth. But it is quite possible that he may, by the very arguments of
those who deny the transmission of sin, be still so far distressed as to be anxious to hear or
know what can be said in reply to them; and on this account he was both unwilling to keep
silent the tenets propounded by them who deny the transmission of sin, in order that he
might get the question in due time discussed, and, at the same time, declined to report the
opinions in his own person, lest he should be supposed to entertain them himself.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>IV.</del>—Proof of Original Sin in Infants.</head>
<p>Now, although I may not be able myself to refute the arguments of these men, I yet see
how necessary it is to adhere closely to the clearest statements of the Scriptures, in order
that the obscure passages may be explained by help of these, or, if the mind be as yet unequal
to either perceiving them when explained, or investigating them whilst abstruse, let them
be believed without misgiving. But what can be plainer than the many weighty testimonies
of the divine declarations, which afford to us the clearest proof possible that without union
with Christ there is no man who can attain to eternal life and salvation; and that no man
can unjustly be damned,—that is, separated from that life and salvation,—by the judgment
of God? The inevitable conclusion from these truths is this, that, as nothing else is effected
when infants are baptized except that they are incorporated into the church, in other words,
that they are united with the body and members of Christ, unless this benefit has been bestowed
upon them, they are manifestly in danger of662 damnation. Damned, however, they
could not be if they really had no sin. Now, since their tender age could not possibly have
contracted sin in its own life, it remains for us, even if we are as yet unable to understand,
at least to believe that infants inherit original sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Jesus is the Saviour Even of Infants.</head>
<p>And therefore, if there is an ambiguity in the apostle’s words when he says, “By one
man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it passed upon all men;”663 and if
it is possible for them to be drawn aside, and applied to some other sense,—is there anything
ambiguous in this statement: “Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God?”664 Is this, again, ambiguous: “Thou shalt call His
name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins?”665 Is there any doubt of what this
means: “The whole need not a physician, but they that are sick?”666—that is, Jesus is not
needed by those who have no sin, but by those who are to be saved from sin. Is there anything,
again, ambiguous in this: “Except men eat the flesh of the Son of man,” that is, become
partakers of His body, “they shall not have life?”667 By these and similar statements, which
I now pass over, —absolutely clear in the light of God, and absolutely certain by His authority,—
does not truth proclaim without ambiguity, that unbaptized infants not only cannot
enter into the kingdom of God, but cannot have everlasting life, except in the body of Christ,
in order that they may be incorporated into which they are washed in the sacrament of
baptism? Does not truth, without any dubiety, testify that for no other reason are they carried
by pious hands to Jesus (that is, to Christ, the Saviour and Physician), than that they may
be healed of the plague of their sin by the medicine of His sacraments? Why then do we
delay so to understand the apostle’s very words, of which we perhaps used to have some
doubt, that they may agree with these statements of which we can have no manner of doubt?</p>

<p>To me, however, no doubt presents itself about the whole of this passage, in which the
apostle speaks of the condemnation of many through the sin of one, and the justification
of many through the righteousness of One, except as to the words, “Adam is the figure of
Him that was to come.”668 For this phrase in reality not only suits the sense which understands
that Adam’s posterity were to be born of the same form as himself along with sin,
but the words are also capable of being drawn out into several distinct meanings. For we
have ourselves perhaps actually contended for various senses from the words in question
at different times,669 and very likely we shall propound yet another view, which, however,
will not be incompatible with the sense here mentioned; and even Pelagius has not always
expounded the passage in one way. All the rest, however, of the passage in which these
doubtful words occur, if its statements are carefully examined and treated, as I have tried
my best to do in the first book of this treatise, will not (in spite of the obscurity of style necessarily
engendered by the subject itself) fail to show the incompatibility of any other
meaning than that which has secured the adhesion of the universal Church from the earliest
times—that believing infants have obtained through the baptism of Christ the remission of
original sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 10 <del>V.</del>—He Shows that Cyprian Had Not Doubted the Original Sin of Infants.</head>
<p>Accordingly, it is not without reason that the blessed Cyprian670 carefully shows how
from the very first the Church has held this as a well understood article of faith. When he
was asserting the fitness of infants only just born to receive Christ’s baptism, on a certain
occasion when he was consulted whether this ought to be administered before the eighth
day, he endeavoured, as far as he could, to prove that they were perfect,671 lest any one
should suppose, from the number of the days (because it was on the eighth day that infants
were before circumcised), that they so far lacked perfection. However, after bestowing upon
them the full support of his argument, he still confessed that they were not free from original
sin; because if he had denied this, he would have removed all reason for the very baptism
which he was maintaining their fitness to receive. You can, if you wish, read for yourself
the epistle of the illustrious martyr On the Baptism of Little Children; for it cannot fail to be
within reach at Carthage. But I have deemed it right to transcribe some few statements of
it into this letter of mine, so far as applies to the question before us; and I pray you to mark
them carefully. “Now with respect,” says he, “to the case of infants, whom you declared it
would be improper to baptize if presented within the second and third day after their birth,
since that due regard ought to be paid to the law of circumcision of old, so that you thought
that the infant should not be baptized and sanctified before the eighth day after its birth,—a
far different view has been formed of the question in our council. Not a man there assented
to what you thought ought to be done; but the whole of us rather determined that to no one
born of men ought God’s mercy and grace to be denied. For since the Lord in His gospel
says, ‘The Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them,’672 so far as in
us lies, not a soul ought, if possible, to be lost.” You observe how in these words he supposes
that it is fraught with ruin and death, not only to the flesh, but also to the soul, for one to
depart this life without that saving sacrament. Wherefore, if he said nothing else, it was
competent to us to conclude from his words that without sin the soul could not perish. See,
however, what (when he shortly afterwards maintains the innocence of infants) he at the
same time allows concerning them in the plainest terms: “But if,” says he, “anything could
hinder men from the attainment of grace, then their heavier sins might rather hinder those
who have reached the stages of adults, and advanced life, and old age. Since, however, remission
of sins is given even to the greatest sinners after they have believed, however much they
have previously sinned against God, and since nobody is forbidden baptism and grace, how

much more ought an infant not to be forbidden who newborn has done no sin, except that
from having been born carnally after Adam he has contracted from his very birth the contagion
of the primeval death! How, too, does this fact contribute in itself the more easily to
their reception of the forgiveness of sins, that the remission which they have is not of their
own sins, but of those of another!”</p>

<pb n="283"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—The Ancients Assumed Original Sin.</head>
<p>You see with what confidence this great man expresses himself after the ancient and
undoubted rule of faith. In advancing such very certain statements, his object was by help
of these firm conclusions to prove the uncertain point which had been submitted to him by
his correspondent, and concerning which he informs him that a decree of a council had
been passed, to the effect that, if an infant were brought even before the eighth day after his
birth, no one should hesitate to baptize him. Now it was not then determined or confirmed
by the council that infants were held bound by original sin as if it were new, or as if it were
attacked by the opposition of some one; but when another controversy was being conducted,
and the question was discussed, in reference to the law of the circumcision of the flesh,
whether they ought to be baptized before the eighth day. None agreed with the person who
denied this; because it was not an open question admitting of discussion, but was fixed and
unassailable, that the soul would forfeit eternal salvation if it ended this life without obtaining
the sacrament of baptism: but at the same time infants fresh from the womb were held to
be affected only by the guilt of original sin. On this account, although remission of sins was
easier in their case, because the sins were derived from another, it was nevertheless indispensable.
It was on sure grounds like these that the uncertain question of the eighth day was
solved, and the council decided that after a man was born, not a day ought to be lost in
rendering him that succour which should prevent his perishing for ever. When also a reason
was given for the circumcision of the flesh as being itself a shadow of what was to be, its
purport was not that we should understand that baptism ought to be administered on the
eighth day after birth, but rather that we are spiritually circumcised in the resurrection of
Christ, who rose from the dead on the third day, indeed, after His passion, but among the
days of the week, by which time is counted, on the eighth, that is, on the first day after the
Sabbath.</p>

<head>Chapter 12 <del>VI.</del>—The Universal Consensus Respecting Original Sin.</head>
<p>And now, again, with a strange boldness in new controversy, certain persons are endeavouring
to make us uncertain on a point which our forefathers used to bring forward as most
certainly fixed, whenever they would solve such questions as seemed uncertain to some.
When this controversy, indeed, first began, I am unable to say; but one thing I know, that
even the holy Jerome, who is in our own day renowned for great industry and learning in
ecclesiastical literature, for the solution of sundry questions treated in his writings, makes
use of the same most certain assumption without exhibition of proofs. For instance, in his
commentary on the prophet Jonah, when he comes to the passage where the infants were
mentioned as chastened by the fast, he says:673 “The greatest age comes first, and then all
the rest is pervaded down to the least.674 For there is no man without sin, whether the span
of his age be but that of a single day, or he reckon many years to his life. For if the very stars
are unclean in the sight of God,675 how much more is a worm and corruption, such as are
they who are held subject to the sin of the offending Adam?” If, indeed, we could readily
interrogate this most learned man, how many authors who have treated of the divine
Scriptures. in both languages,676 and have written on Christian controversies, would he
mention to us, who have never held any other opinion since the Church of Christ was
founded,—who neither received any other from their forefathers, nor handed down any
other to their posterity? My own reading, indeed, has been far more limited, but yet I do
not recollect ever having heard of any other doctrine on this point from Christians, who
accept the two Testaments, whether established in the Catholic Church, or in any heretical
or schismatic body whatever. I do not remember, I say, that I have at any time found any
other doctrine in such writers as have contributed anything to literature of this kind,
whether they have followed the canonical Scriptures, or have supposed that they have followed
them, or had wished to be so supposed. From what quarter this question has suddenly
come upon us I know not. A short time ago,677 in a passing conversation with certain persons
while we were at Carthage, my ears were suddenly offended with such a proposition as this:

<head>Chapter 13 <del>VII.</del>—The Error of Jovinianus Did Not Extend So Far.</head>
<p>A few years ago there lived at Rome one Jovinian,678 who is said to have persuaded
nuns of even advanced age to marry,—not, indeed, by seduction, as if he wanted to make
any of them his wife, but by contending that virgins who dedicated themselves to the ascetic
life had no more merit before God than believing wives. It never entered his mind, however,
along with this conceit, to venture to affirm that children of men are born without original
sin. If, indeed, he had added such an opinion, the women might have more readily consented
to marry, to give birth to such pure offspring. When this man’s writings (for he dared to
write) were by the brethren forwarded to Jerome to refute, he not only discovered no such
error in them, but, while looking out his conceits for refutation, he found among other
passages this very clear testimony to the doctrine of man’s original sin, from which Jerome
indeed felt satisfied of the man’s belief of that doctrine.679 These are his words when treating
of it: “He who says that he abides in Christ, ought himself also to walk even as He walked.680
We give our opponent the option to choose which alternative he likes. Does he abide in
Christ, or does he not? If he does, then, let him walk like Christ. If, however, it is a rash thing
to undertake to resemble the excellences of Christ, he abides not in Christ, because he walks
not as Christ did. He did no sin, neither was any guile found in His mouth;681 who, when
He was reviled, reviled not again; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He opened
not His mouth;682 to whom the prince of this world came, and found nothing in Him;683
whom, though He had done no sin, God made sin for us.684 We, however, according to the
Epistle of James, all commit many sins;685 and none of us is pure from uncleanness, even
if his life should be but of one day.686 For who shall boast that he has a clean heart? Or who
shall be confident that he is pure from sins? We are held guilty according to the likeness of

<head>Chapter 14.—The Opinions of All Controversialists Whatever are Not, However,
Canonical Authority; Original Sin, How Another’s; We Were All One Man in
Adam.</head>
<p>I have not quoted these words as if we might rely upon the opinions of every disputant
as on canonical authority; but I have done it, that it may be seen how, from the beginning
down to the present age, which has given birth to this novel opinion, the doctrine of original
sin has been guarded with the utmost constancy as a part of the Church’s faith, so that it is
usually adduced as most certain ground whereon to refute other opinions when false, instead
of being itself exposed to refutation by any one as false. Moreover, in the sacred books of
the canon, the authority of this doctrine is vigorously asserted in the clearest and fullest
way. The apostle exclaims: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
so it passed upon all men, in which all have sinned.688 Now from these words it cannot
certainly be said, that Adam’s sin has injured even those who commit no sin, for the Scripture
says, “In which all have sinned.” Nor, indeed, are those sins of infancy so said to be another’s,
as if they did not belong to the infants at all, inasmuch as all then sinned in Adam, when in
his nature, by virtue of that innate power whereby he was able to produce them, they were
all as yet the one Adam; but they are called another’s,689 because as yet they were not living
their own lives, but the life of the one man contained whatsoever was in his future posterity.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Origin of Errors; A Simile Sought from the Foreskin of the Circumcised,
and from the Chaff of Wheat.</head>
<p>“But surely,” say they, “if baptism cleanses the primeval sin, they who are born of two
baptized parents ought to be free from this sin; for these could not have transmitted to their
children that thing which they did not themselves possess.” Now observe whence error
usually thrives: it is when persons are able to start subjects which they are not able to understand.
For before what audience, and in what words, can I explain how it is that sinful
mortal beginnings bring no obstacle to those who have inaugurated other, immortal, beginnings,
and at the same time prove an obstacle to those whom those very persons, against
whom it was not an obstacle, have begotten out of the self-same sinful beginnings? How
can a man understand these things, whose labouring mind is impeded both by its own prejudiced
opinions and by the chain of its own stolid obstinacy? If indeed I had undertaken
my cause in opposition to those who either altogether forbid the baptism of infants, or else
contend that it is superfluous to baptize them alleging that as they are born of believing
parents, they must needs enjoy the merit of their parents; then it would have been my duty
to have roused myself perhaps to greater labour and effort for the purpose of refuting their
opinion. In that case, if I encountered a difficulty before obtuse and contentious men in refuting
error and inculcating truth, owing to the obscurity which besets the nature of the
subject, I should probably resort to such illustrations as were palpable and at hand; and I
should in my turn ask them some questions,—how, for instance, if they were puzzled to
know in what way sin, after being cleansed by baptism, still remained in those who were
begotten of baptized parents, they would explain how it is that the foreskin, after being removed
by circumcision, should still remain in the sons of the circumcised? or again, how
it happens that the chaff which is winnowed off so carefully by human labour still keeps its
place in the grain which springs from the winnowed wheat?</p>

<head>Chapter 17 <del>IX.</del>—Christians Do Not Always Beget Christian, Nor the Pure, Pure
Children.</head>
<p>With these and such like palpable arguments, should I endeavour, as I best could, to
convince those persons who believed that sacraments of cleansing were superfluously applied
to the children of the cleansed, how right is the judgment of baptizing the infants of baptized
parents, and how it may happen that to a man who has within him the twofold seed—of
death in the flesh, and of immortality in the spirit—that may prove no obstacle, regenerated
as he is by the Spirit, which is an obstacle to his son, who is generated by the flesh; and that
that may be cleansed in the one by remission, which in the other still requires cleansing by
like remission, just as in the case supposed of circumcision, and as in the case of the winnowing
and thrashing. But now, when we are contending with those who allow that the children
of the baptized ought to be baptized, we may much more conveniently conduct our discussion,
and can say: You who assert that the children of such persons as have been cleansed
from the pollution of sin ought to have been born without sin, why do you not perceive that
by the same rule you might just as well say that the children of Christian parents ought to
have been born Christians? Why, therefore, do you rather maintain that they ought to become
Christians? Was there not in their parents, to whom it is said, “Know ye not that your bodies
are the members of Christ?”690 a Christian body? Perhaps you suppose that a Christian
body may be born of Christian parents, without having received a Christian soul? Well, this
would render the case much more wonderful still. For you would think of the soul one of
two things as you pleased,—because, of course, you hold with the apostle, that before birth
it had done nothing good or evil:691—either that it was derived by transmission, and just
as the body of Christians is Christian, so should also their soul be Christian; or else that it
was created by Christ, either in the Christian body, or for the sake of the Christian body,
and it ought therefore to have been created or given in a Christian condition. Unless perchance
you shall pretend that, although Christian parents had it in their power to beget a
Christian body, yet Christ Himself was not able to produce a Christian soul. Believe then
the truth, and see that, as it has been possible (as you yourselves admit) for one who is not
a Christian to be born of Christian parents, for one who is not a member of Christ to be
born of members of Christ, and (that we may answer all, who, however falsely, are yet in
some sense possessed with a sense of religion) for a man who is not consecrated to be born
of parents who are consecrated; so also it is quite possible for one who is not cleansed to be
born of parents who are cleansed. Now what account will you give us, of why from Christian
parents is born one who is not a Christian, unless it be that not generation, but regeneration
makes Christians? Resolve therefore your own question with a like reason, that cleansing
<note type="footnote">690 1 Cor. vi. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">691 Rom. ix. 11.</note>

<pb n="292"/>
from sin comes to no one by being born, but to all by being born again. And thus any child
who is born of parents who are cleansed, because born again, must himself be born again,
in order that he too may be cleansed. For it has been quite possible for parents to transmit
to their children that which they did not possess themselves,—thus resembling not only the
wheat which yielded the chaff, and the circumcised the foreskin, but also the instance which
you yourselves adduce, even that of believers who convey unbelief to their posterity; which,
however, does not accrue to the faithful as regenerated by the Spirit, but it is owing to the
fault of the mortal seed by which they have been born of the flesh. For in respect of the infants
whom you judge it necessary to make believers by the sacrament of the faithful you do not
deny that they were born in unbelief although of believing parents.</p>

<head>Chapter 18 <del>X.</del>—Is the Soul Derived by Natural Propagation?</head>
<p>Well, but “if the soul is not propagated, but the flesh alone, then the latter alone has
propagation of sin, and it alone deserves punishment:” this is what they think, saying “that
it is unjust that the soul which is only recently produced, and that not out of Adam’s substance,
should bear the sin of another committed so long ago.” Now observe, I pray you,
how the circumspect Pelagius felt the question about the soul to be a very difficult one, and
acted accordingly,—for the words which I have just quoted are copied from his book. He
does not say absolutely, “Because the soul is not propagated,” but hypothetically, If the soul
is not propagated, rightly determining on so obscure a subject (on which we can find in Holy
Scriptures no certain and obvious testimonies, or with very great difficulty discover any) to
speak with hesitation rather than with confidence. Wherefore I too, on my side, answer this
proposition with no hasty assertion: If the soul is not propagated, where is the justice that,
what has been but recently created and is quite free from the contagion of sin, should be
compelled in infants to endure the passions and other torments of the flesh, and, what is
more terrible still, even the attacks of evil spirits? For never does the flesh so suffer anything
of this kind that the living and feeling soul does not rather undergo the punishment. If this,
indeed, is shown to be just, it may be shown, on the same terms, with what justice original
sin comes to exist in our sinful flesh, to be subsequently cleansed by the sacrament of baptism
and God’s gracious mercy. If the former point cannot be shown, I imagine that the latter
point is equally incapable of demonstration. We must therefore either bear with both positions
in silence, and remember that we are human, or else we must prepare, at some other
time, another work on the soul, if it shall appear necessary, discussing the whole question
with caution and sobriety.</p>

<head>Chapter 19 <del>XI.</del>—Sin and Death in Adam, Righteousness and Life in Christ.</head>
<p>What the apostle says: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
so it passed upon all men, in which all have sinned;”692 we must, however, for the present
so accept as not to seem rashly and foolishly to oppose the many great passages of Holy
Scripture, which teach us that no man can obtain eternal life without that union with Christ
which is effected in Him and with Him, when we are imbued with His sacraments and incorporated
with the members of His body. Now this statement which the apostle addresses
to the Romans, “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it passed
upon all men, in which all have sinned,” tallies in sense with his words to the Corinthians:
“Since by man came death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam
all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”693 For nobody doubts that the subject here
referred to is the death of the body, because the apostle was with much earnestness dwelling
on the resurrection of the body; and he seems to be silent here about sin for this reason,
namely, because the question was not about righteousness. Both points are mentioned in
the Epistle to the Romans, and both points are, at very great length, insisted on by the
apostle,—sin in Adam, righteousness in Christ; and death in Adam, life in Christ. However,
as I have observed already, I have thoroughly examined and opened, in the first book of this
treatise, all these words of the apostle’s argument, as far as I was able, and as much as seemed
necessary.</p>

<pb n="295"/>
<head>Chapter 20.—The Sting of Death, What?</head>
<p>But even in the passage to the Corinthians, where he had been treating fully of the resurrection,
the apostle concludes his statement in such a way as not to permit us to doubt
that the death of the body is the result of sin. For after he had said, “This corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality: so when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality, then,” he added, “shall be
brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where
is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?” and at last he subjoined these words: “The sting
of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.”694 Now, because (as the apostle’s words
most plainly declare) death shall then be swallowed up in victory when this corruptible and
mortal shall have put on incorruption and immortality,—that is, when “God shall quicken
even our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us,”—it manifestly follows that the
sting of the body of this death, which is the contrary of the resurrection of the body, is sin.
The sting, however, is that by which death was made, and not that which death made, since
it is by sin that we die, and not by death that we sin. It is therefore called “the sting of death”
on the principle which originated the phrase “the tree of life,”—not because the life of man
produced it, but because by it the life of man was made. In like manner “the tree of knowledge”
was that whereby man’s knowledge was made, not that which man made by his
knowledge. So also “the sting of death” is that by which death was produced, not that which
death made. We similarly use the expression “the cup of death,” since by it some one has
died, or might die,—not meaning, of course, a cup made by a dying or dead man.695 The
sting of death is therefore sin, because by the puncture of sin the human race has been slain.
Why ask further: the death of what,—whether of the soul, or of the body? Whether the first
which we are all of us now dying, or the second which the wicked hereafter shall die? There
is no occasion for plying the question so curiously; there is no room for subterfuge. The
words in which the apostle expresses the case answer the questions: “When this mortal,”
says he, “shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying which is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is
thy sting? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.” He was treating of
the resurrection of the body, wherein death shall be swallowed up in victory, when this
mortal shall have put on immortality. Then over death itself shall be raised the shout of triumph,
when at the resurrection of the body it shall be swallowed up in victory; then shall
be said to it, “O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?” To the death of

the body, therefore, is this said. For victorious immortality shall swallow it up, when this
mortal shall put on immortality. I repeat it, to the death of the body shall it be said, “Where
is thy victory?”—that victory in which thou didst conquer all, so that even the Son of God
engaged in conflict with thee, and by not shrinking but grappling with thee overcame. In
these that die thou hast conquered; but thou art thyself conquered in these that rise again.
Thy victory was but temporal, in which thou didst swallow up the bodies of them that die.
Our victory will abide eternal, in which thou art swallowed up in the bodies of them that
rise again. “Where is thy sting?”—that is, the sin wherewithal we are punctured and poisoned,
so that thou didst fix thyself in our very bodies, and for so long a time didst hold them in
possession. “The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.” We all sinned in
one, so that we all die in one; we received the law, not by amendment according to its precepts
to put an end to sin, but by transgression to increase it. For “the law entered that sin might
abound;”696 and “the Scripture hath concluded all under sin;”697 but “thanks be to God,
who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ,”698 in order that “where sin
abounded, grace might much more abound;”699 and “that the promise by faith of Jesus
Christ might be given to them that believe;”700 and that we might overcome death by a
deathless resurrection, and sin, “the sting” thereof, by a free justification.</p>

Be Figuratively Understood; The Necessity of the Sacraments.</head>
<p>Let no one, then, on this subject be either deceived or a deceiver. The manifest sense of
Holy Scripture which we have considered, removes all obscurities. Even as death is in this
our mortal body derived from the beginning, so from the beginning has sin been drawn
into this sinful flesh of ours, for the cure of which, both as it is derived by propagation and
augmented by wilful transgression, as well as for the quickening of our flesh itself, our
Physician came in the likeness of sinful flesh, who is not needed by the sound, but only by
the sick,—and who came not to call the righteous, but sinners.701 Therefore the saying of
the apostle, when advising believers not to separate themselves from unbelieving partners:
“For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified
by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy,”702 must be either
so understood as both we ourselves elsewhere,703 and as Pelagius in his notes on this same
Epistle to the Corinthians,704 has expounded it, according to the purport of the passages
already mentioned, that sometimes wives gained husbands to Christ, and sometimes husbands
converted wives, whilst the Christian will of even one of the parents prevailed towards
making their children Christians; or else (as the apostle’s words seem rather to indicate, and
to a certain degree compel us) some particular sanctification is to be here understood, by
which an unbelieving husband or wife was sanctified by the believing partner, and by which
the children of the believing parents were sanctified,—whether it was that the husband or
the wife, during the woman’s menstruation, abstained from cohabiting, having learned that
duty in the law (for Ezekiel classes this amongst the precepts which were not to be taken in
a metaphorical sense705), or on account of some other voluntary sanctification which is not
there expressly prescribed,—a sprinkling of holiness arising out of the close ties of married
life and children. Nevertheless, whatever be the sanctification meant, this must be steadily
held: that there is no other valid means of making Christians and remitting sins, except by
men becoming believers through the sacrament according to the institution of Christ and
the Church. For neither are unbelieving husbands and wives, notwithstanding their intimate
union with holy and righteous spouses, cleansed of the sin which separates men from the
kingdom of God and drives them into condemnation, nor are the children who are born of
parents, however just and holy, absolved from the guilt of original sin, unless they have been

<p>As for what they say, that some men, by the use of their reason, have lived, and do live,
in this world without sin, we should wish that it were true, we should strive to make it true,
we should pray that it be true; but, at the same time, we should confess that it is not yet true.
For to those who wish and strive and worthily pray for this result, whatever sins remain in
them are daily remitted because we sincerely pray, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors.”706 Whosoever shall deny that this prayer is in this life necessary for every righteous
man who knows and does the will of God, except the one Saint of saints, greatly errs, and
is utterly incapable of pleasing Him whom he praises. Moreover, if he supposes himself to
be such a character, “he deceives himself, and the truth is not in him,”707—for no other
reason than that he thinks what is false. That Physician, then, who is not needed by the
sound, but by the sick, knows how to heal us, and by healing to perfect us unto eternal life;
and He does not in this world take away death, although inflicted because of sin, from those
whose sins He remits, in order that they may enter on their conflict, and overcome the fear
of death with full sincerity of faith. In some cases, too, He declines to help even His righteous
servants, so long as they are capable of still higher elevation, to the attainment of a perfect
righteousness, in order that (while in His sight no man living is justified708) we may always
feel it to be our duty to give Him thanks for mercifully bearing with us, and so, by holy humility,
be healed of that first cause of all our failings, even the swellings of pride. This letter,
as my intention first sketched it, was to have been a short one; it has grown into a lengthy

<head>EXTRACT FROM AUGUSTIN’S “RETRACTATIONS,”</head>
<head>Book II. Chap. 37,</head>
<head>ON THE FOLLOWING TREATISE,
“DE SPIRITU ET LITTERA.”</head>
<p>The person709 to whom I had addressed the three books entitled De Peccatorum Meritis
et Remissione, in which I carefully discussed also the baptism of infants, informed me, when
acknowledging my communication, that he was much distrurbed because I declared it to
be possible that a man might be without sin, if he wanted not the will, by the help of God,
although no man either had lived, was living, or would live in this life so perfect in righteousness.
He asked how I could say that it was possible of which no example could be adduced.
Owing to this inquiry on the part of this person, I wrote the treatise entitled De Spiritu et
Littera, in which I considered at large the apostle’s statement, “The letter killeth, but the
spirit giveth life.”710 In this work, so far as God enabled me, I earnestly disputed with those
who oppose that grace of God which justifies the servances of the Jews, who abstain from
sundry meats and drinks in accordance with their ancient law, I mentioned the “ceremonies
of certain meats” <del>quarumdam escarum cerimoniæ</del>711—a phrase which, though not used
in Holy Scriptures, seemed to me very convenient, because I remembered that cerimoniæ
is tantamount to carimoniæ, as if from carere, to be without, and expresses the abstinence
of the worshippers from certain things. If however, there is any other derivation of the word,
which is inconsistent with the true religion, I meant no refernce whatever to it; I confined
my use to the sense above indicated. This work of mine begins thus: “After reading the short
treatise which I lately drew up for you, my beloved son Marcellinus,” etc.</p>

<head>A TREATISE ON THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER,</head>
<p>BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;
In One Book,
ADDRESSED TO MARCELLINUS, A.D. 412.</p>
<p>Marcellinus, in a letter to Augustin, had expressed some surprise at having read, in the preceding
work, of the possibility being allowed of a man continuing if he willed it, by God’s help,
without sin in the present life, although not a single human example anywhere of such
perfect righteousness has ever existed. Augustin takes the opportunity of discussing, in
opposition to the Pelagians, the subject of the aid of God’s grace; and he shows that the
divine help to the working of righteousness by us does not lie in the fact of God’s having
given us a law which is full of good and holy precepts; but in the fact that our will itself,
without which we can do nothing good, is assisted and elevated by the Spirit of grace being
imparted to us, without the aid of which the teaching of the law is “the letter that killeth,”
because instead of justifying the ungodly, it rather holds them guilty of transgression. He
begins to treat of the question proposed to him at the commencement of this work, and
returns to it towards its conclusion; he shows that, as all allow, many things are possible
with God’s help, of which there occurs indeed no example; and then concludes that, although
a perfect righteousness is unexampled among men, it is for all that not impossible.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del> —The Occasion of Writing This Work; A Thing May Be Capable of
Being Done, and Yet May Never Be Done.</head>
<p>After reading the short treatises which I lately drew up for you, my beloved son Marcellinus,
about the baptism of infants, and the perfection of man’s righteousness,—how that
no one in this life seems either to have attained or to be likely to attain to it, except only the
Mediator, who bore humanity in the likeness of sinful flesh, without any sin whatever,—you
wrote me in answer that you were embarrassed by the point which I advanced in the second
book,712 that it was possible for a man to be without sin, if he wanted not the will, and was
assisted by the aid of God; and yet that except One in whom “all shall be made alive,”713 no
one has ever lived or will live by whom this perfection has been attained whilst living here.
It appeared to you absurd to say that anything was possible of which no example ever occurred,—
although I suppose you would not hesitate to admit that no camel ever passed
through a needle’s eye,714 and yet He said that even this was possible with God; you may
read, too, that twelve thousand legions715 of angels could possibly have fought for Christ
and rescued Him from suffering, but in fact did not; you may read that it was possible for
the nations to be exterminated at once out of the land which was given to the children of
Israel,716 and yet that God willed it to be gradually effected.717 And one may meet with a
thousand other incidents, the past or the future possibility of which we might readily admit,
and yet be unable to produce any proofs of their having ever really happened. Accordingly,
it would not be right for us to deny the possibility of a man’s living without sin, on the
ground that amongst men none can be found except Him who is in His nature not man
only, but also God, in whom we could prove such perfection of character to have existed.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—The Examples Apposite.</head>
<p>Here, perhaps, you will say to me in answer, that the things which I have instanced as
not having been realized, although capable of realization, are divine works; whereas a man’s
being without sin falls in the range of a man’s own work,—that being indeed his very noblest
work which effects a full and perfect righteousness complete in every part; and therefore
that it is incredible that no man has ever existed, or is existing, or will exist in this life, who
has achieved such a work, if the achievement is possible for a human being. But then you
ought to reflect that, although this great work, no doubt, belongs to human agency to accomplish,
yet it is also a divine gift, and therefore, not doubt that it is a divine work; “for it is
God who worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.”718</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Theirs is Comparatively a Harmless Error, Who Say that a Man Lives
Here Without Sin.</head>
<p>They therefore are not a very dangerous set of persons and they ought to be urged to
show, if they are able, that they are themselves such, who hold that man lives or has lived
here without any sin whatever. There are indeed passages of Scripture, in which I apprehend
it is definitely stated that no man who lives on earth, although enjoying freedom of will, can
be found without sin; as, for instance, the place where it is written, “Enter not into judgment
with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.”719 If, however, anybody
shall have succeeded in showing that this text and the other similar ones ought to be taken
in a different sense from their obvious one, and shall have proved that some man or men
have spent a sinless life on earth,—whoever does not, not merely refrain from much opposing
him, but also does not rejoice with him to the full, is afflicted by extraordinary goads of
envy. Moreover, if there neither is, has been, nor will be any man endowed with such perfection
of purity (which I am more inclined to believe), and yet it is firmly set forth and
thought there is or has been, or is to be,—so far as I can judge, no great error is made, and
certainly not a dangerous one, when a man is thus carried away by a certain benevolent
feeling; provided that he who thinks so much of another, does not think himself to be such
a being, unless he has ascertained that he really and clearly is such.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Theirs is a Much More Serious Error, Requiring a Very Vigorous Refutation,
Who Deny God’s Grace to Be Necessary.</head>
<p>They, however, must be resisted with the utmost ardor and vigor who suppose that
without God’s help, the mere power of the human will in itself, can either perfect righteousness,
or advance steadily towards it; and when they begin to be hard pressed about their
presumption in asserting that this result can be reached without the divine assistance, they
check themselves, and do not venture to utter such an opinion, because they see how impious
and insufferable it is. But they allege that such attainments are not made without God’s help
on this account, namely, because God both created man with the free choice of his will, and,
by giving him commandments, teaches him, Himself, how man ought to live; and indeed
assists him, in that He takes away his ignorance by instructing him in the knowledge of what
he ought to avoid and to desire in his actions: and thus, by means of the free-will naturally
implanted within him, he enters on the way which is pointed out to him, and by persevering
in a just and pious course of life, deserves to attain to the blessedness of eternal life.</p>

<head>Chapter 5 <del>III.</del>—True Grace is the Gift of the Holy Ghost, Which Kindles in the
Soul the Joy and Love of Goodness.</head>
<p>We, however, on our side affirm that the human will is so divinely aided in the pursuit
of righteousness, that (in addition to man’s being created with a free-will, and in addition
to the teaching by which he is instructed how he ought to live) he receives the Holy Ghost,
by whom there is formed in his mind a delight in, and a love of, that supreme and unchangeable
good which is God, even now while he is still “walking by faith” and not yet “by sight;”
720 in order that by this gift to him of the earnest, as it were, of the free gift, he may conceive
an ardent desire to cleave to his Maker, and may burn to enter upon the participation in
that true light, that it may go well with him from Him to whom he owes his existence. A
man’s free-will, indeed, avails for nothing except to sin, if he knows not the way of truth;
and even after his duty and his proper aim shall begin to become known to him, unless he
also take delight in and feel a love for it, he neither does his duty, nor sets about it, nor lives
rightly. Now, in order that such a course may engage our affections, God’s “love is shed
abroad in our hearts,” not through the free-will which arises from ourselves, but “through
the Holy Ghost, which is given to us.”721</p>

<pb n="309"/>
<head>Chapter 6 <del>IV.</del>—The Teaching of Law Without the Life-Giving Spirit is “The Letter
that Killeth.”</head>
<p>For that teaching which brings to us the command to live in chastity and righteousness
is “the letter that killeth,” unless accompanied with “the spirit that giveth life.” For that is
not the sole meaning of the passage, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,”722 which
merely prescribes that we should not take in the literal sense any figurative phrase which in
the proper meaning of its words would produce only nonsense, but should consider what
else it signifies, nourishing the inner man by our spiritual intelligence, since “being carnallyminded
is death, whilst to be spiritually-minded is life and peace.”723 If, for instance, a man
were to take in a literal and carnal sense much that is written in the Song of Solomon, he
would minister not to the fruit of a luminous charity, but to the feeling of a libidinous desire.
Therefore, the apostle is not to be confined to the limited application just mentioned, when
he says, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life;”724 but this is also (and indeed especially)
equivalent to what he says elsewhere in the plainest words: “I had not known lust, except
the law had said, Thou shalt not covet;”725 and again, immediately after: “Sin, taking occasion
by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.”726 Now from this you may see what
is meant by “the letter that killeth.” There is, of course, nothing said figuratively which is
not to be accepted in its plain sense, when it is said, “Thou shall not covet;” but this is a very
plain and salutary precept, and any man who shall fulfil it will have no sin at all. The apostle,
indeed, purposely selected this general precept, in which he embraced everything, as if this
were the voice of the law, prohibiting us from all sin, when he says, “Thou shalt not covet;”
for there is no sin committed except by evil concupiscence; so that the law which prohibits
this is a good and praiseworthy law. But, when the Holy Ghost withholds His help, which
inspires us with a good desire instead of this evil desire (in other words, diffuses love in our
hearts), that law, however good in itself, only augments the evil desire by forbidding it. Just
as the rush of water which flows incessantly in a particular direction, becomes more violent
when it meets with any impediment, and when it has overcome the stoppage, falls in a
greater bulk, and with increased impetuosity hurries forward in its downward course. In
some strange way the very object which we covet becomes all the more pleasant when it is
forbidden. And this is the sin which by the commandment deceives and by it slays,
whenever transgression is actually added, which occurs not where there is no law.727</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>V.</del>—What is Proposed to Be Here Treated.</head>
<p>We will, however, consider, if you please, the whole of this passage of the apostle and
thoroughly handle it, as the Lord shall enable us. For I want, if possible, to prove that the
apostle’s words, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,” do not refer to figurative
phrases,—although even in this sense a suitable signification might be obtained from
them,—but rather plainly to the law, which forbids whatever is evil. When I shall have
proved this, it will more manifestly appear that to lead a holy life is the gift of God,—not
only because God has given a free-will to man, without which there is no living ill or well;
nor only because He has given him a commandment to teach him how he ought to live; but
because through the Holy Ghost He sheds love abroad in the hearts728 of those whom he
foreknew, in order to predestinate them; whom He predestinated, that He might call them;
whom He called, that he might justify them; and whom he justified, that He might glorify
them.729 When this point also shall be cleared, you will, I think, see how vain it is to say
that those things only are unexampled possibilities, which are the works of God,—such as
the passage of the camel through the needle’s eye, which we have already referred to, and
other similar cases, which to us no doubt are impossible, but easy enough to God; and that
man’s righteousness is not to be counted in this class of things, on the ground of its being
properly man’s work, not God’s; although there is no reason for supposing, without an example,
that his perfection exists, even if it is possible. That these assertions are vain will be
clear enough, after it has been also plainly shown that even man’s righteousness must be
attributed to the operation of God, although not taking place without man’s will; and we
therefore cannot deny that his perfection is possible even in this life, because all things are
possible with God, 730—both those which He accomplishes of His own sole will, and those
which He appoints to be done with the cooperation with Himself of His creature’s will.
Accordingly, whatever of such things He does not effect is no doubt without an example in
the way of accomplished facts, although with God it possesses both in His power the cause
of its possibility, and in His wisdom the reason of its unreality. And should this cause be
hidden from man, let him not forget that he is a man; nor charge God with folly simply because
he cannot fully comprehend His wisdom.</p>

<p>Attend, then, carefully, to the apostle while in his Epistle to the Romans he explains and
clearly enough shows that what he wrote to the Corinthians, “The letter killeth, but the
spirit giveth life,”731 must be understood in the sense which we have already indicated,—that
the letter of the law, which teaches us not to commit sin, kills, if the life-giving spirit be absent,
forasmuch as it causes sin to be known rather than avoided, and therefore to be increased
rather than diminished, because to an evil concupiscense there is now added the transgression
of the law.</p>

<head>Chapter 9 <del>VI</del>.—Through the Law Sin Has Abounded.</head>
<p>The apostle, then, wishing to commend the grace which has come to all nations through
Jesus Christ, lest the Jews should extol themselves at the expense of the other peoples on
account of their having received the law, first says that sin and death came on the human
race through one man, and that righteousness and eternal life came also through one, expressly
mentioning Adam as the former, and Christ as the latter; and then says that “the
law, however, entered, that the offence might abound: but where sin abounded, grace did
much more abound: that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.”732 Then, proposing a question for
himself to answer, he adds, “What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace
may abound? God forbid.”733 He saw, indeed, that a perverse use might be made by perverse
men of what he had said: “The law entered, that the offence might abound: but where sin
abounded, grace did much more abound,”—as if he had said that sin had been of advantage
by reason of the abundance of grace. Rejecting this, he answers his question with a “God
forbid!” and at once adds: “How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”734
as much as to say, When grace has brought it to pass that we should die unto sin, what else
shall we be doing, if we continue to live in it, than showing ourselves ungrateful to grace?
The man who extols the virtue of a medicine does not contend that the diseases and wounds
of which the medicine cures him are of advantage to him; on the contrary, in proportion to
the praise lavished on the remedy are the blame and horror which are felt of the diseases
and wounds healed by the much-extolled medicine. In like manner, the commendation and
praise of grace are vituperation and condemnation of offences. For there was need to prove
to man how corruptly weak he was, so that against his iniquity, the holy law brought him
no help towards good, but rather increased than diminished his iniquity; seeing that the law
entered, that the offence might abound; that being thus convicted and confounded, he might
see not only that he needed a physician, but also God as his helper so to direct his steps that
sin should not rule over him, and he might be healed by betaking himself to the help of the
divine mercy; and in this way, where sin abounded grace might much more abound,—not
through the merit of the sinner, but by the intervention of his Helper.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Christ the True Healer.</head>
<p>Accordingly, the apostle shows that the same medicine was mystically set forth in the
passion and resurrection of Christ, when he says, “Know ye not, that so many of us as were
baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with
Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of
the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together
in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection:
knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed,
that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is justified from sin. Now, if we
be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him: knowing that Christ, being
raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over Him. For in that
He died, He died unto sin once; but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God. Likewise reckon
ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.”735 Now it is plain enough that here by the mystery of the Lord’s death and resurrection
is figured the death of our old sinful life, and the rising of the new; and that here is shown
forth the abolition of iniquity and the renewal of righteousness. Whence then arises this
vast benefit to man through the letter of the law, except it be through the faith of Jesus
Christ?</p>

<head>Chapter 11 <del>VII.</del>—From What Fountain Good Works Flow.</head>
<p>This holy meditation preserves “the children of men, who put their trust under the
shadow of God’s wings,”736 so that they are “drunken with the fatness of His house, and
drink of the full stream of His pleasure. For with Him is the fountain of life, and in His light
shall they see light. For He extendeth His mercy to them that know Him, and His righteousness
to the upright in heart.”737 He does not, indeed, extend His mercy to them because
they know Him, but that they may know Him; nor is it because they are upright in heart,
but that they may become so, that He extends to them His righteousness, whereby He justifies
the ungodly.738 This meditation does not elevate with pride: this sin arises when any man
has too much confidence in himself, and makes himself the chief end of living. Impelled by
this vain feeling, he departs from that fountain of life, from the draughts of which alone is
imbibed the holiness which is itself the good life,—and from that unchanging light, by
sharing in which the reasonable soul is in a certain sense inflamed, and becomes itself a
created and reflected luminary; even as “John was a burning and a shining light,”739 who
notwithstanding acknowledged the source of his own illumination in the words, “Of His
fulness have all we received.”740 Whose, I would ask, but His, of course, in comparison with
whom John indeed was no light at all? For “that was the true light, which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.”741 Therefore, in the same psalm, after saying, “Extend Thy
mercy to them that know Thee, and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart,”742 he adds,
“Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hands of sinners move me. There
have fallen all the workers of iniquity: they are cast out, and are not able to stand.”743 Since
by that impiety which leads each to attribute to himself the excellence which is God’s, he is
cast out into his own native darkness, in which consist the works of iniquity. For it is
manifestly these works which he does, and for the achievement of such alone is he naturally
fit. The works of righteousness he never does, except as he receives ability from that fountain
and that light, where the life is that wants for nothing, and where is “no variableness, nor
the shadow of turning.”744</p>

<p>Accordingly Paul, who, although he was formerly called Saul,745 chose this new designation,
for no other reason, as it seems to me, than because he would show himself
little,746—the “least of the apostles,”747—contends with much courage and earnestness
against the proud and arrogant, and such as plume themselves on their own works, in order
that he may commend the grace of God. This grace, indeed, appeared more obvious and
manifest in his case, inasmuch as, while he was pursuing such vehement measures of persecution
against the Church of God as made him worthy of the greatest punishment, he found
mercy instead of condemnation, and instead of punishment obtained grace. Very properly,
therefore, does he lift voice and hand in defence of grace, and care not for the envy either
of those who understood not a subject too profound and abstruse for them, or of those who
perversely misinterpreted his own sound words; whilst at the same time he unfalteringly
preaches that gift of God, whereby alone salvation accrues to those who are the children of
the promise, children of the divine goodness, children of grace and mercy, children of the
new covenant. In the salutation with which he begins every epistle, he prays: “Grace be to
you, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ;”748 whilst this forms
almost the only topic discussed for the Romans, and it is plied with so much persistence
and variety of argument, as fairly to fatigue the reader’s attention, yet with a fatigue so useful
and salutary, that it rather exercises than breaks the faculties of the inner man.</p>

The Circumcision of the Heart.</head>
<p>Then comes what I mentioned above; then he shows what the Jew is, and says that he
is called a Jew, but by no means fulfils what he promises to do. “But if,” says he, “thou callest
thyself a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, and knowest His will, and
triest the things that are different, being instructed out of the law; and art confident that
thou art thyself a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, an instructor of the
foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man
should not steal, dost thou steal? thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost
thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? thou that
makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God? For the name
of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. Circumcision verily
profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
uncircumcision. Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall
not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? And shall not uncircumcision which
is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress
the law? For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is
outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the
heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.”749 Here
he plainly showed in what sense he said, “Thou makest thy boast of God.” For undoubtedly
if one who was truly a Jew made his boast of God in the way which grace demands (which
is bestowed not for merit of works, but gratuitously), then his praise would be of God, and
not of men. But they, in fact, were making their boast of God, as if they alone had deserved
to receive His law, as the Psalmist said: “He did not the like to any nation, nor His judgments
has He displayed to them.”750 And yet, they thought they were fulfilling the law of God by
their righteousness, when they were rather breakers of it all the while! Accordingly, it
“wrought wrath”751 upon them, and sin abounded, committed as it was by them who knew
the law. For whoever did even what the law commanded, without the assistance of the
Spirit of grace, acted through fear of punishment, not from love of righteousness, and hence
in the sight of God that was not in the will, which in the sight of men appeared in the work;
and such doers of the law were held rather guilty of that which God knew they would have
preferred to commit, if only it had been possible with impunity. He calls, however, “the
circumcision of the heart” the will that is pure from all unlawful desire; which comes not

from the letter, inculcating and threatening, but from the Spirit, assisting and healing. Such
doers of the law have their praise therefore, not of men but of God, who by His grace provides
the grounds on which they receive praise, of whom it is said, “My soul shall make her boast
of the Lord;”752 and to whom it is said, “My praise shall be of Thee:”753 but those are not
such who would have God praised because they are men; but themselves, because they are
righteous.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—In What Respect the Pelagians Acknowledge God as the Author of
Our Justification.</head>
<p>“But,” say they, “we do praise God as the Author of our righteousness, in that He gave
the law, by the teaching of which we have learned how we ought to live.” But they give no
heed to what they read: “By the law there shall no flesh be justified in the sight of God.”754
This may indeed be possible before men, but not before Him who looks into our very heart
and inmost will, where He sees that, although the man who fears the law keeps a certain
precept, he would nevertheless rather do another thing if he were permitted. And lest any
one should suppose that, in the passage just quoted from him, the apostle had meant to say
that none are justified by that law, which contains many precepts, under the figure of the
ancient sacraments, and among them that circumcision of the flesh itself, which infants
were commanded to receive on the eighth day after birth; he immediately adds what law he
meant, and says, “For by the law is the knowledge of sin.”755 He refers then to that law of
which he afterwards declares, “I had not known sin but by the law; for I had not known lust
except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”756 For what means this but that “by the law
comes the knowledge of sin?”</p>

<head>Chapter 15 <del>IX.</del>—The Righteousness of God Manifested by the Law and the
Prophets.</head>
<p>Here, perhaps, it may be said by that presumption of man, which is ignorant of the
righteousness of God, and wishes to establish one of its own, that the apostle quite properly
said, “For by the law shall no man be justified,”757 inasmuch as the law merely shows what
one ought to do, and what one ought to guard against, in order that what the law thus points
out may be accomplished by the will, and so man be justified, not indeed by the power of
the law, but by his free determination. But I ask your attention, O man, to what follows.
“But now the righteousness of God,” says he, “without the law is manifested, being witnessed
by the law and the prophets.”758 Does this then sound a light thing in deaf ears? He says,
“The righteousness of God is manifested.” Now this righteousness they are ignorant of, who
wish to establish one of their own; they will not submit themselves to it.759 His words are,
“The righteousness of God is manifested:” he does not say, the righteousness of man, or the
righteousness of his own will, but the “righteousness of God,”—not that whereby He is
Himself righteous, but that with which He endows man when He justifies the ungodly. This
is witnessed by the law and the prophets; in other words, the law and the prophets each afford
it testimony. The law, indeed, by issuing its commands and threats, and by justifying no
man, sufficiently shows that it is by God’s gift, through the help of the Spirit, that a man is
justified; and the prophets, because it was what they predicted that Christ at His coming
accomplished. Accordingly he advances a step further, and adds, “But righteousness of God
by faith of Jesus Christ,”760 that is by the faith wherewith one believes in Christ for just as
there is not meant the faith with which Christ Himself believes, so also there is not meant
the righteousness whereby God is Himself righteous. Both no doubt are ours, but yet they
are called God’s, and Christ’s, because it is by their bounty that these gifts are bestowed
upon us. The righteousness of God then is without the law, but not manifested without the
law; for if it were manifested without the law, how could it be witnessed by the law? That
righteousness of God, however, is without the law, which God by the Spirit of grace bestows
on the believer without the help of the law,—that is, when not helped by the law. When,
indeed, He by the law discovers to a man his weakness, it is in order that by faith he may
flee for refuge to His mercy, and be healed. And thus concerning His wisdom we are told,
that “she carries law and mercy upon her tongue,”761—the “law,” whereby she may convict
the proud, the “mercy,” wherewith she may justify the humbled. “The righteousness of God,”

then, “by faith of Jesus Christ, is unto all that believe; for there is no difference, for all have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God”762—not of their own glory. For what have they,
which they have not received? Now if they received it, why do they glory as if they had not
received it?763 Well, then, they come short of the glory of God; now observe what follows:
“Being justified freely by His grace.”764 It is not, therefore, by the law, nor is it by their own
will, that they are justified; but they are justified freely by His grace,—not that it is wrought
without our will; but our will is by the law shown to be weak, that grace may heal its infirmity;
and that our healed will may fulfil the law, not by compact under the law, nor yet in the
absence of law.</p>

<head>Chapter 16 <del>X.</del>—How the Law Was Not Made for a Righteous Man.</head>
<p>Because “for a righteous man the law was not made;”765 and yet “the law is good, if a
man use it lawfully.”766 Now by connecting together these two seemingly contrary statements,
the apostle warns and urges his reader to sift the question and solve it too. For how can it
be that “the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,” if what follows is also true: “Knowing this,
that the law is not made for a righteous man?”767 For who but a righteous man lawfully uses
the law? Yet it is not for him that it is made, but for the unrighteous. Must then the unrighteous
man, in order that he may be justified,—that is, become a righteous man,—lawfully
use the law, to lead him, as by the schoolmaster’s hand,768 to that grace by which alone he
can fulfil what the law commands? Now it is freely that he is justified thereby,—that is, on
account of no antecedent merits of his own works; “otherwise grace is no more grace,”769
since it is bestowed on us, not because we have done good works, but that we may be able
to do them,—in other words, not because we have fulfilled the law, but in order that we may
be able to fulfil the law. Now He said, “I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,”770
of whom it was said, “We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth.”771 This is the glory which is meant in the words, “All have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God;”772 and this the grace of which he speaks in the
next verse, “Being justified freely by His grace.”773 The unrighteous man therefore lawfully
uses the law, that he may become righteous; but when he has become so, he must no longer
use it as a chariot, for he has arrived at his journey’s end,—or rather (that I may employ the
apostle’s own simile, which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he
is now fully learned. How then is the law not made for a righteous man, if it is necessary for
the righteous man too, not that he may be brought as an unrighteous man to the grace that
justifies, but that he may use it lawfully, now that he is righteous? Does not the case perhaps
stand thus,—nay, not perhaps, but rather certainly,—that the man who is become righteous
thus lawfully uses the law, when he applies it to alarm the unrighteous, so that whenever
the disease of some unusual desire begins in them, too, to be augmented by the incentive

of the law’s prohibition and an increased amount of transgression, they may in faith flee for
refuge to the grace that justifies, and becoming delighted with the sweet pleasures of holiness,
may escape the penalty of the law’s menacing letter through the spirit’s soothing gift? In
this way the two statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each other:
even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the law be not made for the
righteous man; for it is not by the law that he becomes righteous, but by the law of faith,
which led him to believe that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling
the precepts which “the law of works”774 commanded, except to be assisted by the grace of
God.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—The Exclusion of Boasting.</head>
<p>Accordingly he says, “Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
Nay; but by the law of faith.”775 He may either mean, the laudable boasting, which is in the
Lord; and that it is excluded, not in the sense that it is driven off so as to pass away, but that
it is clearly manifested so as to stand out prominently. Whence certain artificers in silver
are called “exclusores.”776 In this sense it occurs also in that passage in the Psalms: “That
they may be excluded, who have been proved with silver,”777—that is, that they may stand
out in prominence, who have been tried by the word of God. For in another passage it is
said: “The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver which is tried in the fire.”778 Or if this
be not his meaning, he must have wished to mention that vicious boasting which comes of
pride—that is, of those who appear to themselves to lead righteous lives, and boast of their
excellence as if they had not received it,—and further to inform us, that by the law of faith,
not by the law of works, this boasting was excluded, in the other sense of shut out and driven
away; because by the law of faith every one learns that whatever good life he leads he has
from the grace of God, and that from no other source whatever can he obtain the means of
becoming perfect in the love of righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter 18 <del>XI.</del>—Piety is Wisdom; That is Called the Righteousness of God, Which
He Produces.</head>
<p>Now, this meditation makes a man godly, and this godliness is true wisdom. By godliness
I mean that which the Greeks designate θεοσέβεια,—that very virtue which is commended
to man in the passage of Job, where it is said to him, “Behold, godliness is wisdom.”779 Now
if the word θεοσέβεια be interpreted according to its derivation, it might be called “the
worship of God;”780 and in this worship the essential point is, that the soul be not ungrateful
to Him. Whence it is that in the most true and excellent sacrifice we are admonished to
“give thanks unto our Lord God.”781 Ungrateful however, our soul would be, were it to attribute
to itself that which it received from God, especially the righteousness, with the works
of which (the especial property, as it were, of itself, and produced, so to speak, by the soul
itself for itself) it is not puffed up in a vulgar pride, as it might be with riches, or beauty of
limb, or eloquence, or those other accomplishments, external or internal, bodily or mental,
which wicked men too are in the habit of possessing, but, if I may say so, in a wise complacency,
as of things which constitute in an especial manner the good works of the good. It is
owing to this sin of vulgar pride that even some great men have drifted from the sure anchorage
of the divine nature, and have floated down into the shame of idolatry. Whence the
apostle again in the same epistle, wherein he so firmly maintains the principle of grace, after
saying that he was a debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, to the wise and to the
unwise, and professing himself ready, so far as to him pertained, to preach the gospel even
to those who lived in Rome, adds: “I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the
power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the
Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written,
The just shall live by faith.”782 This is the righteousness of God, which was veiled in the Old
Testament, and is revealed in the New; and it is called the righteousness of God, because by
His bestowal of it He makes us righteous, just as we read that “salvation is the Lord’s,”783
because He makes us safe. And this is the faith “from which” and “to which” it is revealed,—
from the faith of them who preach it, to the faith of those who obey it. By this faith
of Jesus Christ—that is, the faith which Christ has given to us—we believe it is from God

<head>Chapter 19 <del>XII</del>—The Knowledge of God Through the Creation.</head>
<p>And then the apostle very properly turns from this point to describe with detestation
those men who, light-minded and puffed up by the sin which I have mentioned in the preceding
chapter, have been carried away of their own conceit, as it were, through empty space
where they could find no resting-place, only to fall shattered to pieces against the vain figments
of their idols, as against stones. For, after he had commended the piety of that faith,
whereby, being justified, we must needs be pleasing to God, he proceeds to call our attention
to what we ought to abominate as the opposite. “For the wrath of God,” says he, “is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold down the truth
in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is manifest in them: for God
hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him are clearly seen from the creation
of the world, being understood through the things that are made, even His eternal power
and divinity; so that they are without excuse: because, knowing God, they yet glorified Him
not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools; and they changed
the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds,
and to four footed beasts, and to creeping things.”784 Observe, he does not say that they
were ignorant of the truth, but that they held down the truth in unrighteousness. For it occurred
to him, that he would inquire whence the knowledge of the truth could be obtained
by those to whom God had not given the law; and he was not silent on the source whence
they could have obtained it: for he declares that it was through the visible works of creation
that they arrived at the knowledge of the invisible attributes of the Creator. And, in very
deed, as they continued to possess great faculties for searching, so they were able to find.
Wherein then lay their impiety? Because “when they knew God, they glorified Him not as
God, nor gave Him thanks, but became vain in their imaginations.” Vanity is a disease especially
of those who mislead themselves, and “think themselves to be something, when they
are nothing.”785 Such men, indeed, darken themselves in that swelling pride, the foot of
which the holy singer prays that it may not come against him,786 after saying, “In Thy light
shall we see light;”787 from which very light of unchanging truth they turn aside, and “their
foolish heart is darkened.”788 For theirs was not a wise heart, even though they knew God;
but it was foolish rather, because they did not glorify Him as God, or give Him thanks; for

<p>Now why need I speak of what follows? For why it was that by this their impiety those
men—I mean those who could have known the Creator through the creature—fell (since
“God resisteth the proud”791) and whither they plunged, is better shown in the sequel of
this epistle than we can here mention. For in this letter of mine we have not undertaken to
expound this epistle, but only mainly on its authority, to demonstrate, so far as we are able,
that we are assisted by divine aid towards the achievement of righteousness,—not merely
because God has given us a law full of good and holy precepts, but because our very will
without which we cannot do any good thing, is assisted and elevated by the importation of
the Spirit of grace, without which help mere teaching is “the letter that killeth,”792 forasmuch
as it rather holds them guilty of transgression, than justifies the ungodly. Now just as those
who come to know the Creator through the creature received no benefit towards salvation,
from their knowledge,—because “though they knew God, they glorified Him not as God,
nor gave Him thanks, although professing themselves to be wise;”793—so also they who
know from the law how man ought to live, are not made righteous by their knowledge, because,
“going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves
unto the righteousness of God.”794</p>

<head>Chapter 21 <del>XIII.</del>—The Law of Works and the Law of Faith.</head>
<p>The law, then, of deeds, that is, the law of works, whereby this boasting is not excluded,
and the law of faith, by which it is excluded, differ from each other; and this difference it is
worth our while to consider, if so be we are able to observe and discern it. Hastily, indeed,
one might say that the law of works lay in Judaism, and the law of faith in Christianity; forasmuch
as circumcision and the other works prescribed by the law are just those which the
Christian system no longer retains. But there is a fallacy in this distinction, the greatness of
which I have for some time been endeavoring to expose; and to such as are acute in appreciating
distinctions, especially to yourself and those like you, I have possibly succeeded in
my effort. Since, however, the subject is an important one, it will not be unsuitable, if with
a view to its illustration, we linger over the many testimonies which again and again meet
our view. Now, the apostle says that that law by which no man is justified,795 entered in that
the offence might abound,796 and yet in order to save it from the aspersions of the ignorant
and the accusations of the impious, he defends this very law in such words as these: “What
shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin but by the law: for
I had not known concupiscence, except the law had said, Thou shall not covet. But sin,
taking occasion, wrought, by the commandment, in me all manner of concupiscence.”797
He says also: “The law indeed is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and good;
but sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good.”798 It is therefore
the very letter that kills which says, “Thou shalt not covet,” and it is of this that he speaks
in a passage which I have before referred to: “By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now
the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the
prophets; even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ upon all them that
believe; for there is no difference: seeing that all have sinned, and come short of the glory
of God: being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His
righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to
declare His righteousness at this time; that He might be just, and the justifier of him which
believeth in Jesus.”799 And then he adds the passage which is now under consideration:
“Where, then, is your boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law
of faith.”800 And so it is the very law of works itself which says, “Thou shalt not covet;” be-

cause thereby comes the knowledge of sin. Now I wish to know, if anybody will dare to tell
me, whether the law of faith does not say to us, “Thou shalt not covet”? For if it does not
say so to us, what reason is there why we, who are placed under it, should not sin in safety
and with impunity? Indeed, this is just what those people thought the apostle meant, of
whom he writes: “Even as some affirm that we say, Let us do evil, that good may come;
whose damnation is just.”801 If, on the contrary, it too says to us, “Thou shall not covet”
(even as numerous passages in the gospels and epistles so often testify and urge), then why
is not this law also called the law of works? For it by no means follows that, because it retains
not the “works” of the ancient sacraments,—even circumcision and the other ceremonies,—it
therefore has no “works” in its own sacraments, which are adapted to the present age; unless,
indeed, the question was about sacramental works, when mention was made of the law, just
because by it is the knowledge of sin, and therefore nobody is justified by it, so that it is not
by it that boasting is excluded, but by the law of faith, whereby the just man lives. But is
there not by it too the knowledge of sin, when even it says, “Thou shall not covet?”</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—No Man Justified by Works.</head>
<p>What the difference between them is, I will briefly explain. What the law of works enjoins
by menace, that the law of faith secures by faith. The one says, “Thou shalt not covet;”802
the other says, “When I perceived that nobody could be continent, except God gave it to
him; and that this was the very point of wisdom, to know whose gift she was; I approached
unto the Lord, and I besought Him.”803 This indeed is the very wisdom which is called piety,
in which is worshipped “the Father of lights, from whom is every best giving and perfect
gift.”804 This worship, however, consists in the sacrifice of praise and giving of thanks, so
that the worshipper of God boasts not in himself, but in Him.805 Accordingly, by the law
of works, God says to us, Do what I command thee; but by the law of faith we say to God,
Give me what Thou commandest. Now this is the reason why the law gives its command,—to
admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that he to whom the command is given, if he
is as yet unable to perform it, may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability,
and complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the ability
comes. “For we have received not the spirit of this world,” says again that most constant
preacher of grace, “but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are
freely given to us of God.”806 What, however, “is the spirit of this world,” but the spirit of
pride? By it their foolish heart is darkened, who, although knowing God, glorified Him not
as God, by giving Him thanks.807 Moreover, it is really by this same spirit that they too are
deceived, who, while ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their
own righteousness, have not submitted to God’s righteousness.808 It appears to me, therefore,

<head>Chapter 23 <del>XIV.</del>—How the Decalogue Kills, If Grace Be Not Present.</head>
<p>Although, therefore, the apostle seems to reprove and correct those who were being
persuaded to be circumcised, in such terms as to designate by the word “law” circumcision
itself and other similar legal observances, which are now rejected as shadows of a future
substance by Christians who yet hold what those shadows figuratively promised; he at the
same time nevertheless would have it to be clearly understood that the law, by which he says
no man is justified, lies not merely in those sacramental institutions which contained
promissory figures, but also in those works by which whosoever has done them lives holily,
and amongst which occurs this prohibition: “Thou shalt not covet.” Now, to make our
statement all the clearer, let us look at the Decalogue itself. It is certain, then, that Moses on
the mount received the law, that he might deliver it to the people, written on tables of stone
by the finger of God. It is summed up in these ten commandments, in which there is no
precept about circumcision, nor anything concerning those animal sacrifices which have
ceased to be offered by Christians. Well, now, I should like to be told what there is in these
ten commandments, except the observance of the Sabbath, which ought not to be kept by
a Christian,—whether it prohibit the making and worshipping of idols and of any other
gods than the one true God, or the taking of God’s name in vain; or prescribe honour to
parents; or give warning against fornication, murder, theft, false witness, adultery, or coveting
other men’s property? Which of these commandments would any one say that the Christian
ought not to keep? Is it possible to contend that it is not the law which was written on those
two tables that the apostle describes as “the letter that killeth,” but the law of circumcision
and the other sacred rites which are now abolished? But then how can we think so, when
in the law occurs this precept, “Thou shall not covet,” by which very commandment, notwithstanding
its being holy, just, and good, “sin,” says the apostle, “deceived me, and by it
slew me?”810 What else can this be than “the letter” that “killeth”?</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—The Passage in Corinthians.</head>
<p>In the passage where he speaks to the Corinthians about the letter that kills, and the
spirit that gives life, he expresses himself more clearly, but he does not mean even there any
other “letter” to be understood than the Decalogue itself, which was written on the two
tables. For these are His words: “Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle
of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not
in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. And such trust have we through Christ
to God-ward: not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God; who hath made us fit, as ministers of the new testament; not of
the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration
of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could
not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which was to be
done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration
of condemnation be glory, much more shall the ministration of righteousness abound
in glory.811 A good deal might be said about these words; but perhaps we shall have a more
fitting opportunity at some future time. At present, however, I beg you to observe how he
speaks of the letter that killeth, and contrasts therewith the spirit that giveth life. Now this
must certainly be “the ministration of death written and engraven in stones,” and “the
ministration of condemnation,” since the law entered that sin might abound.812 But the
commandments themselves are so useful and salutary to the doer of them, that no one could
have life unless he kept them. Well, then, is it owing to the one precept about the Sabbathday,
which is included in it, that the Decalogue is called “the letter that killeth?” Because,
forsooth, every man that still observes that day in its literal appointment is carnally wise,
but to be carnally wise is nothing else than death? And must the other nine commandments,
which are rightly observed in their literal form, not be regarded as belonging to the law of
works by which none is justified, but to the law of faith whereby the just man lives? Who
can possibly entertain so absurd an opinion as to suppose that “the ministration of death,
written and engraven in stones,” is not said equally of all the ten commandments, but only
of the solitary one touching the Sabbath-day? In which class do we place that which is thus
spoken of: “The law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression?”813 and
again thus: “Until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no
law?”814 and also that which we have already so often quoted: “By the law is the knowledge

<head>Chapter 25.—The Passage in Romans.</head>
<p>Now carefully consider this entire passage, and see whether it says anything about circumcision,
or the Sabbath, or anything else pertaining to a foreshadowing sacrament. Does
not its whole scope amount to this, that the letter which forbids sin fails to give man life,
but rather “killeth,” by increasing concupiscence, and aggravating sinfulness by transgression,
unless indeed grace liberates us by the law of faith, which is in Christ Jesus, when His love
is “shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us?”817 The apostle having
used these words: “That we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the
letter,”818 goes on to inquire, “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay; I
had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou
shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner
of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once;
but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which
was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment
deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy,
and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin,
that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment
might become exceeding sinful. For we know that the law is spiritual; whereas I am
carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that I do not; but
what I hate, that I do. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is
good. But then it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me
(that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing. To will, indeed, is present with me; but how
to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil
which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it,
but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I see another law in my
members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of
sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ out Lord. So then with the mind I
myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.” 819</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—No Fruit Good Except It Grow from the Root of Love.</head>
<p>It is evident, then, that the oldness of the letter, in the absence of the newness of the
spirit, instead of freeing us from sin, rather makes us guilty by the knowledge of sin. Whence
it is written in another part of Scripture, “He that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow,”
820—not that the law is itself evil, but because the commandment has its good in the
demonstration of the letter, not in the assistance of the spirit; and if this commandment is
kept from the fear of punishment and not from the love of righteousness, it is servilely kept,
not freely, and therefore it is not kept at all. For no fruit is good which does not grow from
the root of love. If, however, that faith be present which worketh by love,821 then one begins
to delight in the law of God after the inward man,822 and this delight is the gift of the spirit,
not of the letter; even though there is another law in our members still warring against the
law of the mind, until the old state is changed, and passes into that newness which increases
from day to day in the inward man, whilst the grace of God is liberating us from the body
of this death through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter 27 <del>XV.</del>—Grace, Concealed in the Old Testament, is Revealed in the New.</head>
<p>This grace hid itself under a veil in the Old Testament, but it has been revealed in the
New Testament according to the most perfectly ordered dispensation of the ages, forasmuch
as God knew how to dispose all things. And perhaps it is a part of this hiding of grace, that
in the Decalogue, which was given on Mount Sinai, only the portion which relates to the
Sabbath was hidden under a prefiguring precept. The Sabbath is a day of sanctification; and
it is not without significance that, among all the works which God accomplished, the first
sound of sanctification was heard on the day when He rested from all His labours. On this,
indeed, we must not now enlarge. But at the same time I deem it to be enough for the point
now in question, that it was not for nothing that the nation was commanded on that day to
abstain from all servile work, by which sin is signified; but because not to commit sin belongs
to sanctification, that is, to God’s gift through the Holy Spirit. And this precept alone among
the others, was placed in the law, which was written on the two tables of stone, in a prefiguring
shadow, under which the Jews observe the Sabbath, that by this very circumstance it
might be signified that it was then the time for concealing the grace, which had to be revealed
in the New Testament by the death of Christ,—the rending, as it were, of the veil.823 “For
when,” says the apostle, “it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.”824</p>

<head>Chapter 28 <del>XVI</del>—Why the Holy Ghost is Called the Finger of God.</head>
<p>“Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”825
Now this Spirit of God, by whose gift we are justified, whence it comes to pass that we delight
not to sin,—in which is liberty; even as, when we are without this Spirit, we delight to sin,—in
which is slavery, from the works of which we must abstain;—this Holy Spirit, through whom
love is shed abroad in our hearts, which is the fulfilment of the law, is designated in the
gospel as “the finger of God.”826 Is it not because those very tables of the law were written
by the finger of God, that the Spirit of God by whom we are sanctified is also the finger of
God, in order that, living by faith, we may do good works through love? Who is not touched
by this congruity, and at the same time diversity? For as fifty days are reckoned from the
celebration of the Passover (which was ordered by Moses to be offered by slaying the typical
lamb,827 to signify, indeed, the future death of the Lord) to the day when Moses received
the law written on the tables of stone by the finger of God,828 so, in like manner, from the
death and resurrection of Him who was led as a lamb to the slaughter,829 there were fifty
complete days up to the time when the finger of God—that is, the Holy Spirit—gathered
together in one830 perfect company those who believed.</p>

<head>Chapter 29 <del>XVII.</del>—A Comparison of the Law of Moses and of the New Law.</head>
<p>Now, amidst this admirable correspondence, there is at least this very considerable diversity
in the cases, in that the people in the earlier instance were deterred by a horrible
dread from approaching the place where the law was given; whereas in the other case the
Holy Ghost came upon them who were gathered together in expectation of His promised
gift. There it was on tables of stone that the finger of God operated; here it was on the hearts
of men. There the law was given outwardly, so that the unrighteous might be terrified;831
here it was given inwardly, so that they might be justified.832 For this, “Thou shalt not
commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment,”—
such, of course, as was written on those tables,—“it is briefly comprehended,”
says he, “in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no
ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”833 Now this was not written
on the tables of stone, but “is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given
unto us.”834 God’s law, therefore, is love. “To it the carnal mind is not subject, neither indeed
can be;”835 but when the works of love are written on tables to alarm the carnal mind, there
arises the law of works and “the letter which killeth” the transgressor; but when love itself
is shed abroad in the hearts of believers, then we have the law of faith, and the spirit which
gives life to him that loves.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—The New Law Written Within.</head>
<p>Now, observe how consonant this diversity is with those words of the apostle which I
quoted not long ago in another connection, and which I postponed for a more careful consideration
afterwards: “Forasmuch,” says he, “as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle
of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not
in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.”836 See how he shows that the one is
written without man, that it may alarm him from without; the other within man himself,
that it may justify him from within. He speaks of the “fleshy tables of the heart,” not of the
carnal mind, but of a living agent possessing sensation, in comparison with a stone, which
is senseless. The assertion which he subsequently makes,—that “the children of Israel could
not look stedfastly on the end of the face of Moses,” and that he accordingly spoke to them
through a veil,837—signifies that the letter of the law justifies no man, but that rather a veil
is placed on the reading of the Old Testament, until it shall be turned to Christ, and the veil
be removed;—in other words, until it shall be turned to grace, and be understood that from
Him accrues to us the justification, whereby we do what He commands. And He commands,
in order that, because we lack in ourselves, we may flee to Him for refuge. Accordingly, after
most guardedly saying, “Such trust have we through Christ to God-ward,”838 the apostle
immediately goes on to add the statement which underlies our subject, to prevent our confidence
being attributed to any strength of our own. He says: “Not that we are sufficient of
ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; who also hath
made us fit to be ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”839</p>

<head>Chapter 31 <del>XVIII.</del>—The Old Law Ministers Death; The New, Righteousness.</head>
<p>Now, since, as he says in another passage, “the law was added because of transgression,”
840 meaning the law which is written externally to man, he therefore designates it both
as “the ministration of death,”841 and “the ministration of condemnation;”842 but the other,
that is, the law of the New Testament, he calls “the ministration of the Spirit”843 and “the
ministration of righteousness,”844 because through the Spirit we work righteousness, and
are delivered from the condemnation due to transgression. The one, therefore, vanishes
away, the other abides; for the terrifying schoolmaster will be dispensed with, when love
has succeeded to fear. Now “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”845 But that this
ministration is vouchsafed to us, not on account of our deserving, but from His mercy, the
apostle thus declares: “Seeing then that we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
let us faint not; but let us renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
nor adulterating the word of God with deceit.”846 By this “craftiness” and “deceitfulness”
he would have us understand the hypocrisy with which the arrogant would fain be supposed
to be righteous. Whence in the psalm, which the apostle cites in testimony of this grace of
God, it is said, “Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose
mouth is no guile.”847 This is the confession of lowly saints, who do not boast to be what
they are not. Then, in a passage which follows not long after, the apostle writes thus: “For
we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’
sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”848 This is
the knowledge of His glory, whereby we know that He is the light which illumines our
darkness. And I beg you to observe how he inculcates this very point: “We have,” says he,
“this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of
us.”849 When further on he commends in glowing terms this same grace, in the Lord Jesus
Christ, until he comes to that vestment of the righteousness of faith, “clothed with which

“that mortality might be swallowed up of life;”850—observe what he says: “Now He that
hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of
the Spirit;”851 and after a little he thus briefly draws the conclusion of the matter: “That we
might be made the righteousness of God in Him.”852 This is not the righteousness whereby
God is Himself righteous, but that whereby we are made righteous by Him.</p>

the clearest way: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will consummate a new
covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant
which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out
of the land of Egypt. Because they continued not in my covenant, I also have rejected them,
saith the Lord. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After
those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;
and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every
man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all
know me, from the least unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their
iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” 853 What say we to this? One nowhere, or
hardly anywhere, except in this passage of the prophet, finds in the Old Testament Scriptures
any mention so made of the New Testament as to indicate it by its very name. It is no doubt
often referred to and foretold as about to be given, but not so plainly as to have its very name
mentioned. Consider then carefully, what difference God has testified as existing between
the two testaments—the old covenant and the new.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—The Law; Grace.</head>
<p>After saying, “Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day
that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt,” observe what He adds:
“Because they continued not in my covenant.” He reckons it as their own fault that they did
not continue in God’s covenant, lest the law, which they received at that time, should seem
to be deserving of blame. For it was the very law that Christ “came not to destroy, but to
fulfil.” 854 Nevertheless, it is not by that law that the ungodly are made righteous, but by
grace; and this change is effected by the life-giving Spirit, without whom the letter kills. “For
if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have
been by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith
of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.”855 Out of this promise, that is, out of
the kindness of God, the law is fulfilled, which without the said promise only makes men
transgressors, either by the actual commission of some sinful deed, if the flame of concupiscence
have greater power than even the restraints of fear, or at least by their mere will, if the
fear of punishment transcend the pleasure of lust. In what he says, “The Scripture hath
concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them
that believe,” it is the benefit of this “conclusion” itself which is asserted. For what purposes
“hath it concluded,” except as it is expressed in the next sentence: “Before, indeed, faith
came, we were kept under the law, concluded for the faith which was afterwards revealed?”856
The law was therefore given, in order that grace might be sought; grace was given, in order
that the law might be fulfilled. Now it was not through any fault of its own that the law was
not fulfilled, but by the fault of the carnal mind; and this fault was to be demonstrated by
the law, and healed by grace. “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit.”857 Accordingly, in the passage which we cited from the
prophet, he says, “I will consummate a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the
house of Judah,”858—and what means I will consummate but I will fulfil?—“not, according
to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to
bring them out of the land of Egypt.”859</p>

<head>Chapter 35 <del>XX.</del>—The Old Law; The New Law.</head>
<p>The one was therefore old, because the other is new. But whence comes it that one is
old and the other new, when the same law, which said in the Old Testament, “Thou shalt
not covet,”860 is fulfilled by the New Testament? “Because,” says the prophet, “they continued
not in my covenant, I have also rejected them, saith the Lord.”861 It is then on account of
the offence of the old man, which was by no means healed by the letter which commanded
and threatened, that it is called the old covenant; whereas the other is called the new covenant,
because of the newness of the spirit, which heals the new man of the fault of the old. Then
consider what follows, and see in how clear a light the fact is placed, that men who bare faith
are unwilling to trust in themselves: “Because,” says he, “this is the covenant which I will
make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts.”862 See how similarly the apostle states it in the
passage we have already quoted: “Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart,”863
because “not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.”864 And I apprehend that the
apostle in this passage had no other reason for mentioning “the New Testament” (“who
hath made us able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit”), than
because he had an eye to the words of the prophet, when he said “Not in tables of stone, but
in fleshy tables of the heart,” inasmuch as in the prophet it runs: “I will write it in their
hearts.”865</p>

<head>Chapter 36 <del>XXI.</del>—The Law Written in Our Hearts.</head>
<p>What then is God’s law written by God Himself in the hearts of men, but the very
presence of the Holy Spirit, who is “the finger of God,” and by whose presence is shed abroad
in our hearts the love which is the fulfilling of the law,866 and the end of the commandment?
867 Now the promises of the Old Testament are earthly; and yet (with the exception
of the sacramental ordinances which were the shadow of things to come, such as circumcision,
the Sabbath and other observances of days, and the ceremonies of certain meats,868 and the
complicated ritual of sacrifices and sacred things which suited “the oldness” of the carnal
law and its slavish yoke) it contains such precepts of righteousness as we are even now taught
to observe, which were especially expressly drawn out on the two tables without figure or
shadow: for instance, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” “Thou shalt do no murder,” “Thou
shalt not covet,”869 “and whatsoever other commandment is briefly comprehended in the
saying, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself.”870 Nevertheless, whereas as in the said
Testament earthly and temporal promises are, as I have said, recited, and these are goods
of this corruptible flesh (although they prefigure those heavenly and everlasting blessings
which belong to the New Testament), what is now promised is a good for the heart itself, a
good for the mind, a good of the spirit, that is, an intellectual good; since it is said, “I will
put my law in their inward parts, and in their hearts will I write them,” 871—by which He
signified that men would not fear the law which alarmed them externally, but would love
the very righteousness of the law which dwelt inwardly in their hearts.</p>

<head>Chapter 37 <del>XXII.</del>—The Eternal Reward.</head>
<p>He then went on to state the reward: “I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”872
This corresponds to the Psalmist’s words to God: “It is good for me to hold me fast by
God.”873 “I will be,” says God, “their God, and they shall be my people.” What is better than
this good, what happier than this happiness,—to live to God, to live from God, with whom
is the fountain of life, and in whose light we shall see light?874 Of this life the Lord Himself
speaks in these words: “This is life eternal that they may know Thee the only true God, and
Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent,”875—that is, “Thee and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
sent,” the one true God. For no less than this did Himself promise to those who love Him:
“He that loveth me, keepeth my commandments; and he that loveth me shall be loved of
my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him”876—in the form, no
doubt, of God, wherein He is equal to the Father; not in the form of a servant, for in this He
will display Himself even to the wicked also. Then, however, shall that come to pass which
is written, “Let the ungodly man be taken away, that he see not the glory of the Lord.”877
Then also shall “the wicked go into everlasting punishment, and the righteous into life
eternal.”878 Now this eternal life, as I have just mentioned, has been defined to be, that they
may know the one true God.879 Accordingly John again says: “Beloved, now are we the sons
of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear,
we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.”880 This likeness begins even now to be
reformed in us, while the inward man is being renewed from day to day, according to the
image of Him that created him.881</p>

<p>But what is this change, and how great, in comparison with the perfect eminence which
is then to be realized? The apostle applies some sort of illustration, derived from well-known
things, to these indescribable things, comparing the period of childhood with the age of
manhood. “When I was a child,” says he, “I used to speak as a child, to understand as a child,
to think as a child; but when I became a man, I put aside childish things.” 882 He then immediately
explains why he said this in these words: “For now we see by means of a mirror,
darkly but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am
known.”883</p>

<p>Accordingly, in our prophet likewise, whose testimony we are dealing with, this is added,
that in God is the reward, in Him the end, in Him the perfection of happiness, in Him the
sum of the blessed and eternal life. For after saying, “I will be their God, and they shall be
my people,” he at once adds, “And they shall no more teach every man his neighbour, and
every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least
even unto the greatest of them.”884 Now, the present is certainly the time of the New Testament,
the promise of which is given by the prophet in the words which we have quoted from
his prophecy. Why then does each man still say even now to his neighbour and his brother,
“Know the Lord?” Or is it not perhaps meant that this is everywhere said when the gospel
is preached, and when this is its very proclamation? For on what ground does the apostle
call himself “a teacher of the Gentiles,” 885 if it be not that what he himself implies in the
following passage becomes realized: “How shall they call on Him in whom they have not
believed? and how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall
they hear without a preacher?”886 Since, then, this preaching is now everywhere spreading,
in what way is it the time of the New Testament of which the prophet spoke in the words,
“And they shall not every man teach his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know
the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,”887
unless it be that he has included in his prophetic forecast the eternal reward of the said New
Testament, by promising us the most blessed contemplation of God Himself?</p>

<p>What then is the import of the “All, from the least unto the greatest of them,” but all
that belong spiritually to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah,—that is, to the children
of Isaac, to the seed of Abraham? For such is the promise, wherein it was said to him, “In
Isaac shall thy seed be called; for they which are the children of the flesh are not the children
of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. For this is the word of
promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. And not only this; but when
Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, (for the children being not yet
born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth,) it was said unto her, “The elder shall
serve the younger.”888 This is the house of Israel, or rather the house of Judah, on account
of Christ, who came of the tribe of Judah. This is the house of the children of promise,—not
by reason of their own merits, but of the kindness of God. For God promises what He
Himself performs: He does not Himself promise, and another perform; which would no
longer be promising, but prophesying. Hence it is “not of works, but of Him that calleth,”889
lest the result should be their own, not God’s; lest the reward should be ascribed not to His
grace, but to their due; and so grace should be no longer grace which was so earnestly defended
and maintained by him who, though the least of the apostles, laboured more abundantly
than all the rest,—yet not himself, but the grace of God that was with him.890 “They shall
all know me,”891 He says,—“All,” the house of Israel and house of Judah. “All,” however,
“are not Israel which are of Israel,”892 but they only to whom it is said in “the psalm concerning
the morning aid”893 (that is, concerning the new refreshing light, meaning that of
the new testament), “All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him; and fear Him, all ye the seed of
Israel.”894 All the seed, without exception, even the entire seed of the promise and of the
called, but only of those who are the called according to His purpose.895 “For whom He did
predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom
He justified, them He also glorified.”896 “Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace;

who imitate the faith of Abraham,—“who is the father of us all; as it is written, I have made
thee the father of many nations.” 897 Now all these predestinated, called, justified, glorified

<head>Chapter 41.—The Law Written in the Heart, and the Reward of the Eternal Contemplation

Least and the Greatest.</head>
<p>As then the law of works, which was written on the tables of stone, and its reward, the
land of promise, which the house of the carnal Israel after their liberation from Egypt received,
belonged to the old testament, so the law of faith, written on the heart, and its reward,
the beatific vision which the house of the spiritual Israel, when delivered from the present
world, shall perceive, belong to the new testament. Then shall come to pass what the apostle
describes: “Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall
cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away,”898—even that imperfect knowledge
of “the child”899 in which this present life is passed, and which is but “in part,” “by means
of a mirror darkly.”900 Because of this, indeed, “prophecy” is necessary, for still to the past
succeeds the future; and because of this, too, “tongues” are required,—that is, a multiplicity
of expressions, since it is by different ones that different things are suggested to him who
does not as yet contemplate with a perfectly purified mind the everlasting light of transparent
truth. “When that, however, which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
done away,” 901 then, what appeared to the flesh in assumed flesh shall display Itself as It is
in Itself to all who love It; then, there shall be eternal life for us to know the one very God;902
then shall we be like Him,903 because “we shall then know, even as we are known;”904 then
“they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying,
Know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the least unto the greatest of them.”905
Now this may be understood in several ways: Either, that in that life the saints shall differ
one from another in glory, as star from star. It matters not how the expression
runs,—whether (as in the passage before us) it be, “From the least unto the greatest of them,”
or the other way, From the greatest unto the least. And, in like manner, it matters not even
if we understand “the least” to mean those who simply believe, and “the greatest” those who
have been further able to understand—so far as may be in this world—the light which is
incorporeal and unchangeable. Or, “the least” may mean those who are later in time; whilst

by “the greatest” He may have intended to indicate those who were prior in time. For they
are all to receive the promised vision of God hereafter, since it was for us that they foresaw
the future which would be better than their present, that they without us should not arrive
at complete perfection. 906 And so the earlier are found to be the lesser, because they were
less deferred in time; as in the case of the gospel “penny a day,” which is given for an illustration.
907 This penny they are the first to receive who came last into the vineyard. Or, “the
least and the greatest” ought perhaps to be taken in some other sense, which at present does
not occur to my mind.</p>

<head>Chapter 42 <del>XXV.</del>—Difference Between the Old and the New Testaments.</head>
<p>I beg of you, however, carefully to observe, as far as you can, what I am endeavouring
to prove with so much effort. When the prophet promised a new covenant, not according
to the covenant which had been formerly made with the people of Israel when liberated
from Egypt, he said nothing about a change in the sacrifices or any sacred ordinances, although
such change, too, was without doubt to follow, as we see in fact that it did follow,
even as the same prophetic scripture testifies in many other passages; but he simply called
attention to this difference, that God would impress His laws on the mind of those who
belonged to this covenant, and would write them in their hearts,908 whence the apostle drew
his conclusion,—“not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone,
but in fleshy tables of the heart;”909 and that the eternal recompense of this righteousness
was not the land out of which were driven the Amorites and Hittites, and other nations who
dwelt there,910 but God Himself, “to whom it is good to hold fast,”911 in order that God’s
good that they love, may be the God Himself whom they love, between whom and men
nothing but sin produces separation; and this is remitted only by grace. Accordingly, after
saying, “For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them,” He instantly added,
“For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”912 By the law of
works, then, the Lord says, “Thou shalt not covet:”913 but by the law of faith He says,
“Without me ye can do nothing;”914 for He was treating of good works, even the fruit of
the vine-branches. It is therefore apparent what difference there is between the old covenant
and the new,—that in the former the law is written on tables, while in the latter on hearts;
so that what in the one alarms from without, in the other delights from within; and in the
former man becomes a transgressor through the letter that kills, in the other a lover through
the life-giving spirit. We must therefore avoid saying, that the way in which God assists us
to work righteousness, and “works in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure,”915 is
by externally addressing to our faculties precepts of holiness; for He gives His increase in-

<head>Chapter 43 <del>XXVI.</del>—A Question Touching the Passage in the Apostle About the
Gentiles Who are Said to Do by Nature the Law’s Commands, Which They are
Also Said to Have Written on Their Hearts.</head>
<p>Now we must see in what sense it is that the apostle says, “For when the Gentiles, which
have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,
are a law unto themselves, which show the work of the law written in their hearts,”918 lest
there should seem to be no certain difference in the new testament, in that the Lord promised
that He would write His laws in the hearts of His people, inasmuch as the Gentiles have this
done for them naturally. This question therefore has to be sifted, arising as it does as one of
no inconsiderable importance. For some one may say, “If God distinguishes the new testament
from the old by this circumstance, that in the old He wrote His law on tables, but in
the new He wrote them on men’s hearts, by what are the faithful of the new testament discriminated
from the Gentiles, which have the work of the law written on their hearts, whereby
they do by nature the things of the law,919 as if, forsooth, they were better than the ancient
people, which received the law on tables, and before the new people, which has that conferred
on it by the new testament which nature has already bestowed on them?”</p>

<pb n="359"/>
<head>Chapter 44.—The Answer Is, that the Passage Must Be Understood of the Faithful
of the New Covenant.</head>
<p>Has the apostle perhaps mentioned those Gentiles as having the law written in their
hearts who belong to the new testament? We must look at the previous context. First, then,
referring to the gospel, he says, “It is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth;
to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed
from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.”920 Then he goes on to speak
of the ungodly, who by reason of their pride profit not by the knowledge of God, since they
did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful.921 He then passes to those who think
and do the very things which they condemn,—having in view, no doubt, the Jews, who made
their boast of God’s law, but as yet not mentioning them expressly by name; and then he
says, “Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile: but glory, honour, and peace, to every soul that
doeth good; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: for there is no respect of persons with
God. For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law; and as many
as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law; for not the hearers of the law are just
before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.”922 Who they are that are treated of
in these words, he goes on to tell us: “For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by
nature the things contained in the law,”923 and so forth in the passage which I have quoted
already. Evidently, therefore, no others are here signified under the name of Gentiles than
those whom he had before designated by the name of “Greek” when he said, “To the Jew
first, and also to the Greek.”924 Since then the gospel is “the power of God unto salvation
to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and, also to the Greek;”925 and since “indignation
and wrath, tribulation and anguish, are upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew
first, and also of the Greek: but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that doeth good; to
the Jew first, and also to the Greek;” since, moreover, the Greek is indicated by the term
“Gentiles” who do by nature the things contained in the law, and which have the work of
the law written in their hearts: it follows that such Gentiles as have the law written in their
hearts belong to the gospel, since to them, on their believing, it is the power of God unto
salvation. To what Gentiles, however, would he promise glory, and honour, and peace, in
their doing good works, if living without the grace of the gospel? Since there is no respect

of persons with God,926 and since it is not the hearers of the law, but the doers thereof, that
are justified,927 it follows that any man of any nation, whether Jew or Greek, who shall believe,
will equally have salvation under the gospel. “For there is no difference,” as he says afterwards;
“for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God: being justified freely by His
grace.”928 How then could he say that any Gentile person, who was a doer of the law, was
justified without the Saviour’s grace?</p>

<head>Chapter 45.—It is Not by Their Works, But by Grace, that the Doers of the Law are
Justified; God’s Saints and God’s Name Hallowed in Different Senses.</head>
<p>Now he could not mean to contradict himself in saying, “The doers of the law shall be
justified,”929 as if their justification came through their works, and not through grace; since
he declares that a man is justified freely by His grace without the works of the law,930 intending
by the term “freely” nothing else than that works do not precede justification. For in
another passage he expressly says, “If by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace
is no longer grace.”931 But the statement that “the doers of the law shall be justified”932 must
be so understood, as that we may know that they are not otherwise doers of the law, unless
they be justified, so that justification does not subsequently accrue to them as doers of the
law, but justification precedes them as doers of the law. For what else does the phrase “being
justified” signify than being made righteous,—by Him, of course, who justifies the ungodly
man, that he may become a godly one instead? For if we were to express a certain fact by
saying, “The men will be liberated,” the phrase would of course be understood as asserting
that the liberation would accrue to those who were men already; but if we were to say, The
men will be created, we should certainly not be understood as asserting that the creation
would happen to those who were already in existence, but that they became men by the
creation itself. If in like manner it were said, The doers of the law shall be honoured, we
should only interpret the statement correctly if we supposed that the honour was to accrue
to those who were already doers of the law: but when the allegation is, “The doers of the law
shall be justified,” what else does it mean than that the just shall be justified? for of course
the doers of the law are just persons. And thus it amounts to the same thing as if it were
said, The doers of the law shall be created,—not those who were so already, but that they
may become such; in order that the Jews who were hearers of the law might hereby understand
that they wanted the grace of the Justifier, in order to be able to become its doers also.
Or else the term “They shall be justified” is used in the sense of, They shall be deemed, or
reckoned as just, as it is predicated of a certain man in the Gospel, “But he, willing to justify
himself,”933—meaning that he wished to be thought and accounted just. In like manner,
we attach one meaning to the statement, “God sanctifies His saints,” and another to the
words, “Sanctified be Thy name;”934 for in the former case we suppose the words to mean
that He makes those to be saints who were not saints before, and in the latter, that the

<head>Chapter 46.—How the Passage of the Law Agrees with that of the Prophet.</head>
<p>If therefore the apostle, when he mentioned that the Gentiles do by nature the things
contained in the law, and have the work of the law written in their hearts,935 intended those
to be understood who believed in Christ,—who do not come to the faith like the Jews,
through a precedent law,—there is no good reason why we should endeavour to distinguish
them from those to whom the Lord by the prophet promises the new covenant, telling them
that He will write His laws in their hearts,936 inasmuch as they too, by the grafting which
he says had been made of the wild olive, belong to the self-same olive-tree,937—in other
words, to the same people of God. There is therefore a good agreement of this passage of
the apostle with the words of the prophet so that belonging to the new testament means
having the law of God not written on tables, but on the heart,—that is, embracing the
righteousness of the law with innermost affection, where faith works by love.938 Because it
is by faith that God justifies the Gentiles; and the Scripture foreseeing this, preached the
gospel before to Abraham, saying, “In thy seed shall all nations be blessed,”939 in order that
by this grace of promise the wild olive might be grafted into the good olive, and believing
Gentiles might be made children of Abraham, “in Abraham’s seed, which is Christ,”940 by
following the faith of him who, without receiving the law written on tables, and not yet
possessing even circumcision, “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”941
Now what the apostle attributed to Gentiles of this character,—how that “they have the
work of the law written in their hearts;”942 must be some such thing as what he says to the
Corinthians: “not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.”943 For thus do they
become of the house of Israel, when their uncircumcision is accounted circumcision, by the
fact that they do not exhibit the righteousness of the law by the excision of the flesh, but
keep it by the charity of the heart. “If,” says he, “the uncircumcision keep the righteousness
of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?”944 And therefore in
the house of the true Israel, in which is no guile,945 they are partakers of the new testament,

<head>Chapter 47 <del>XXVII.</del>—The Law “Being Done by Nature” Means, Done by Nature
as Restored by Grace.</head>
<p>Nor ought it to disturb us that the apostle described them as doing that which is contained
in the law “by nature,”—not by the Spirit of God, not by faith, not by grace. For it is
the Spirit of grace that does it, in order to restore in us the image of God, in which we were
naturally created.948 Sin, indeed, is contrary to nature, and it is grace that heals it,—on which
account the prayer is offered to God, “Be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned
against Thee.”949 Therefore it is by nature that men do the things which are contained in
the law;950 for they who do not, fail to do so by reason of their sinful defect. In consequence
of this sinfulness, the law of God is erased out of their hearts; and therefore, when, the sin
being healed, it is written there, the prescriptions of the law are done “by nature,”—not that
by nature grace is denied, but rather by grace nature is repaired. For “by one man sin entered
into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men; in which all have sinned;”
951 wherefore “there is no difference: they all come short of the glory of God, being justified
freely by His grace.”952 By this grace there is written on the renewed inner man that righteousness
which sin had blotted out; and this mercy comes upon the human race through
our Lord Jesus Christ. “For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the
Man Christ Jesus.”953</p>

<head>Chapter 48.—The Image of God is Not Wholly Blotted Out in These Unbelievers;
Venial Sins.</head>
<p>According to some, however, they who do by nature the things contained in the law
must not be regarded as yet in the number of those whom Christ’s grace justifies, but rather
as among those some of whose actions (although they are those of ungodly men, who do
not truly and rightly worship the true God) we not only cannot blame, but even justly and
rightly praise, since they have been done—so far as we read, or know, or hear—according
to the rule of righteousness; though at the same time, were we to discuss the question with
what motive they are done, they would hardly be found to be such as deserve the praise and
defence which are due to righteous conduct. <del>XXVIII.</del> Still, since God’s image has not been
so completely erased in the soul of man by the stain of earthly affections, as to have left remaining
there not even the merest lineaments of it whence it might be justly said that man,
even in the ungodliness of his life, does, or appreciates, some things contained in the law;
if this is what is meant by the statement that “the Gentiles, which have not the law” (that is,
the law of God), “do by nature the things contained in the law,”954 and that men of this
character “are a law to themselves,” and “show the work of the law written in their
hearts,”—that is to say, what was impressed on their hearts when they were created in the
image of God has not been wholly blotted out:—even in this view of the subject, that wide
difference will not be disturbed, which separates the new covenant from the old, and which
lies in the fact that by the new covenant the law of God is written in the hearts of believers,
whereas in the old it was inscribed on tables of stone. For this writing in the heart is effected
by renovation, although it had not been completely blotted out by the old nature. For just
as that image of God is renewed in the mind of believers by the new testament, which impiety
had not quite abolished (for there had remained undoubtedly that which the soul of man
cannot be except it be rational), so also the law of God, which had not been wholly blotted
out there by unrighteousness, is certainly written thereon, renewed by grace. Now in the
Jews the law which was written on tables could not effect this new inscription, which is
justification, but only transgression. For they too were men, and there was inherent in them
that power of nature, which enables the rational soul both to perceive and do what is lawful;
but the godliness which transfers to another life happy and immortal has “a spotless law,
converting souls,”955 so that by the light thereof they may be renewed, and that be accomplished
in them which is written, “There has been manifested over us, O Lord, the light of
Thy countenance.”956 Turned away from which, they have deserved to grow old, whilst they
are incapable of renovation except by the grace of Christ,—in other words, without the in-

tercession of the Mediator; there being “one God and one Mediator between God and men,
the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all.”957 Should those be strangers to
His grace of whom we are treating, and who (after the manner of which we have spoken
with sufficient fulness already) “do by nature the things contained in the law,”958 of what
use will be their “excusing thoughts” to them “in the day when God shall judge the secrets
of men,”959 unless it be perhaps to procure for them a milder punishment? For as, on the
one hand, there are certain venial sins which do not hinder the righteous man from the attainment
of eternal life, and which are unavoidable in this life, so, on the other hand, there
are some good works which are of no avail to an ungodly man towards the attainment of
everlasting life, although it would be very difficult to find the life of any very bad man
whatever entirely without them. But inasmuch as in the kingdom of God the saints differ
in glory as one star does from another,960 so likewise, in the condemnation of everlasting
punishment, it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that other city;961 whilst some
men will be twofold more the children of hell than others.962 Thus in the judgment of God
not even this fact will be without its influence,—that one man will have sinned more, or
less, than another, even when both are involved in the ungodliness that is worthy of damnation.</p>

<head>Chapter 49.—The Grace Promised by the Prophet for the New Covenant.</head>
<p>What then could the apostle have meant to imply by,—after checking the boasting of
the Jews, by telling them that “not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers
of the law shall be justified,”963—immediately afterwards speaking of them “which, having
not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,”964 if in this description not they
are to be understood who belong to the Mediator’s grace, but rather they who, while not
worshipping the true God with true godliness, do yet exhibit some good works in the general
course of their ungodly lives? Or did the apostle perhaps deem it probable, because he had
previously said that “with God there is no respect of persons,”965 and had afterwards said
that “God is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles,”966—that even such
scanty little works of the law, as are suggested by nature, were not discovered in such as received
not the law, except as the result of the remains of the image of God; which He does
not disdain when they believe in Him, with whom there is no respect of persons? But
whichever of these views is accepted, it is evident that the grace of God was promised to the
new testament even by the prophet, and that this grace was definitively announced to take
this shape,—God’s laws were to be written in men’s hearts; and they were to arrive at such
a knowledge of God, that they were not each one to teach his neighbour and brother, saying,
Know the Lord; for all were to know Him, from the least to the greatest of them.967 This is
the gift of the Holy Ghost, by which love is shed abroad in our hearts,968—not, indeed, any
kind of love, but the love of God, “out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned
faith,”969 by means of which the just man, while living in this pilgrim state, is led
on, after the stages of “the glass,” and “the enigma,” and “what is in part,” to the actual vision,
that, face to face, he may know even as he is known.970 For one thing has he required of the
Lord, and that he still seeks after, that he may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of
his life, in order to behold the pleasantness of the Lord.971</p>

<head>Chapter 50 <del>XXIX.</del>—Righteousness is the Gift of God.</head>
<p>Let no man therefore boast of that which he seems to possess, as if he had not received
it;972 nor let him think that he has received it merely because the external letter of the law
has been either exhibited to him to read, or sounded in his ear for him to hear. For “if
righteousness is by the law, then Christ has died in vain.”973 Seeing, however, that if He has
not died in vain, He has ascended up on high, and has led captivity captive, and has given
gifts to men,974 it follows that whosoever has, has from this source. But whosoever denies
that he has from Him, either has not, or is in great danger of being deprived of what he
has.975 “For it is one God which justifies the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision
through faith;”976 in which clauses there is no real difference in the sense, as if the phrase
“by faith” meant one thing, and “through faith” another, but only a variety of expression.
For in one passage, when speaking of the Gentiles,—that is, of the uncircumcision,—he
says, “The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen by faith;”977 and again,
in another, when speaking of the circumcision, to which he himself belonged, he says, “We
who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified
by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Jesus Christ.”978
Observe, he says that both the uncircumcision are justified by faith, and the circumcision
through faith, if, indeed, the circumcision keep the righteousness of faith. For the Gentiles,
which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness
which is by faith,979—by obtaining it of God, not by assuming it of themselves. But Israel,
which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works980—in other words,
working it out as it were by themselves, not believing that it is God who works within them.
“For it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.”981
And hereby “they stumbled at the stumbling-stone.”982 For what he said, “not by faith, but

as it were by works,”983 he most clearly explained in the following words: “They, being ignorant
of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have
not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law
for righteousness to every one that believeth.”984 Then are we still in doubt what are those
works of the law by which a man is not justified, if he believes them to be his own works, as
it were, without the help and gift of God, which is “by the faith of Jesus Christ?” And do we
suppose that they are circumcision and the other like ordinances, because some such things
in other passages are read concerning these sacramental rites too? In this place, however, it
is certainly not circumcision which they wanted to establish as their own righteousness,
because God established this by prescribing it Himself. Nor is it possible for us to understand
this statement, of those works concerning which the Lord says to them, “Ye reject the
commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition;”985 because, as the apostle
says, Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of
righteousness.”986 He did not say, Which followed after their own traditions, framing them
and relying on them. This then is the sole distinction, that the very precept, “Thou shalt not
covet,”987 and God’s other good and holy commandments, they attributed to themselves;
whereas, that man may keep them, God must work in him through faith in Jesus Christ,
who is “the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”988 That is to say,
every one who is incorporated into Him and made a member of His body, is able, by His
giving the increase within, to work righteousness. It is of such a man’s works that Christ
Himself has said, “Without me ye can do nothing.”989</p>

<head>Chapter 51.—Faith the Ground of All Righteousness.</head>
<p>The righteousness of the law is proposed in these terms,—that whosoever shall do it
shall live in it; and the purpose is, that when each has discovered his own weakness, he may
not by his own strength, nor by the letter of the law (which cannot be done), but by faith,
conciliating the Justifier, attain, and do, and live in it. For the work in which he who does
it shall live, is not done except by one who is justified. His justification, however, is obtained
by faith; and concerning faith it is written, “Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into
heaven? (that is, to bring down Christ therefrom;) or, Who shall descend into the deep?
(that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee,
even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is (says he), the word of faith which we preach:
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart
that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”990 As far as he is saved, so
far is he righteous. For by this faith we believe that God will raise even us from the
dead,—even now in the spirit, that we may in this present world live soberly, righteously,
and godly in the renewal of His grace; and by and by in our flesh, which shall rise again to
immortality, which indeed is the reward of the Spirit, who precedes it by a resurrection
which is appropriate to Himself,—that is, by justification. “For we are buried with Christ
by baptism unto death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”991 By faith, therefore, in Jesus Christ
we obtain salvation,—both in so far as it is begun within us in reality, and in so far as its
perfection is waited for in hope; “for whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be
saved.”992 “How abundant,” says the Psalmist, “is the multitude of Thy goodness, O Lord,
which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, and hast perfected for them that hope in
Thee!”993 By the law we fear God; by faith we hope in God: but from those who fear punishment
grace is hidden. And the soul which labours under this fear, since it has not conquered
its evil concupiscence, and from which this fear, like a harsh master, has not departed,—let
it flee by faith for refuge to the mercy of God, that He may give it what He commands, and
may, by inspiring into it the sweetness of His grace through His Holy Spirit, cause the soul
to delight more in what He teaches it, than it delights in what opposes His instruction. In
this manner it is that the great abundance of His sweetness,—that is, the law of faith,—His
love which is in our hearts, and shed abroad, is perfected in them that hope in Him, that
good may be wrought by the soul, healed not by the fear of punishment, but by the love of
righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter 52 <del>XXX.</del>—Grace Establishes Free Will.</head>
<p>Do we then by grace make void free will? God forbid! Nay, rather we establish free will.
For even as the law by faith, so free will by grace, is not made void, but established.994 For
neither is the law fulfilled except by free will; but by the law is the knowledge of sin, by faith
the acquisition of grace against sin, by grace the healing of the soul from the disease of sin,
by the health of the soul freedom of will, by free will the love of righteousness, by love of
righteousness the accomplishment of the law. Accordingly, as the law is not made void, but
is established through faith, since faith procures grace whereby the law is fulfilled; so free
will is not made void through grace, but is established, since grace cures the will whereby
righteousness is freely loved. Now all the stages which I have here connected together in
their successive links, have severally their proper voices in the sacred Scriptures. The law
says: “Thou shall not covet.”995 Faith says: “Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.”996
Grace says: “Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.”997
Health says: “O Lord my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me.”998 Free will
says: “I will freely sacrifice unto Thee.”999 Love of righteousness says: “Transgressors told
me pleasant tales, but not according to Thy law, O Lord.”1000 How is it then that miserable
men dare to be proud, either of their free will, before they are freed, or of their own strength,
if they have been freed? They do not observe that in the very mention of free will they pronounce
the name of liberty. But “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”1001 If,
therefore, they are the slaves of sin, why do they boast of free will? For by what a man is
overcome, to the same is he delivered as a slave.1002 But if they have been freed, why do
they vaunt themselves as if it were by their own doing, and boast, as if they had not received?
Or are they free in such sort that they do not choose to have Him for their Lord who says
to them: “Without me ye can do nothing;”1003 and “If the Son shall make you free, ye shall
be free indeed?”1004</p>

<head>Chapter 53 <del>XXXI.</del>—Volition and Ability.</head>
<p>Some one will ask whether the faith itself, in which seems to be the beginning either of
salvation, or of that series leading to salvation which I have just mentioned, is placed in our
power. We shall see more easily, if we first examine with some care what “our power” means.
Since, then, there are two things,—will and ability; it follows that not every one that has the
will has therefore the ability also, nor has every one that possesses the ability the will also;
for as we sometimes will what we cannot do, so also we sometimes can do what we do not
will. From the words themselves when sufficiently considered, we shall detect, in the very
ring of the terms, the derivation of volition from willingness, and of ability from ableness.1005
Therefore, even as the man who wishes has volition, so also the man who can has ability.
But in order that a thing may be done by ability, the volition must be present. For no man
is usually said to do a thing with ability if he did it unwillingly. Although, at the same time,
if we observe more precisely, even what a man is compelled to do unwillingly, he does, if
he does it, by his volition; only he is said to be an unwilling agent, or to act against his will,
because he would prefer some other thing. He is compelled, indeed, by some unfortunate
influence, to do what he does under compulsion, wishing to escape it or to remove it out of
his way. For if his volition be so strong that he prefers not doing this to not suffering that,
then beyond doubt he resists the compelling influence, and does it not. And accordingly, if
he does it, it is not with a full and free will, but yet it is not without will that he does it; and
inasmuch as the volition is followed by its effect, we cannot say that he lacked the ability to
do it. If, indeed, he willed to do it, yielding to compulsion, but could not, although we should
allow that a coerced will was present, we should yet say that ability was absent. But when
he did not do the thing because he was unwilling, then of course the ability was present, but
the volition was absent, since he did it not, by his resistance to the compelling influence.
Hence it is that even they who compel, or who persuade, are accustomed to say, Why don’t
you do what you have in your ability, in order to avoid this evil? While they who are utterly
unable to do what they are compelled to do, because they are supposed to be able usually
answer by excusing themselves, and say, I would do it if it were in my ability. What then do
we ask more, since we call that ability when to the volition is added the faculty of doing?
Accordingly, every one is said to have that in his ability which he does if he likes, and does
not if he dislikes.</p>

<head>Chapter 54.—Whether Faith Be in a Man’s Own Power.</head>
<p>Attend now to the point which we have laid down for discussion: whether faith is in
our own power? We now speak of that faith which we employ when we believe anything,
not that which we give when we make a promise; for this too is called faith.1006 We use the
word in one sense when we say, “He had no faith in me,” and in another sense when we say,
“He did not keep faith with me.” The one phrase means, “He did not believe what I said;”
the other, “He did not do what he promised.” According to the faith by which we believe,
we are faithful to God; but according to that whereby a thing is brought to pass which is
promised, God Himself even is faithful to us; for the apostle declares, “God is faithful, who
will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.”1007 Well, now, the former is the
faith about which we inquire, Whether it be in our power? even the faith by which we believe
God, or believe on God. For of this it is written, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted
unto him for righteousness.”1008 And again, “To him that believeth on Him that justifieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”1009 Consider now whether anybody
believes, if he be unwilling; or whether he believes not, if he shall have willed it. Such a position,
indeed, is absurd (for what is believing but consenting to the truth of what is said?
and this consent is certainly voluntary): faith, therefore, is in our own power. But, as the
apostle says: “There is no power but comes from God,”1010 what reason then is there why
it may not be said to us even of this: “What hast thou which thou hast not received?”1011—for
it is God who gave us even to believe. Nowhere, however, in Holy Scripture do we find such
an assertion as, There is no volition but comes from God. And rightly is it not so written,
because it is not true: otherwise God would be the author even of sins (which Heaven forbid!),
if there were no volition except what comes from Him; inasmuch as an evil volition alone
is already a sin, even if the effect be wanting,—in other words, if it has not ability. But when
the evil volition receives ability to accomplish its intention, this proceeds from the judgment
of God, with whom there is no unrighteousness.1012 He indeed punishes after this manner;
nor is His chastisement unjust because it is secret. The ungodly man, however, is not aware
that he is being punished, except when he unwillingly discovers by an open penalty how
much evil he has willingly committed. This is just what the apostle says of certain men: “God

at all against me, except it were given thee from above.”1014 But still, when the ability is
given, surely no necessity is imposed. Therefore, although David had received ability to kill
Saul, he preferred sparing to striking him.1015 Whence we understand that bad men receive
ability for the condemnation of their depraved will, while good men receive ability for trying
of their good will.</p>

<head>Chapter 55 <del>XXXII.</del>—What Faith is Laudable.</head>
<p>Since faith, then, is in our power, inasmuch as every one believes when he likes, and,
when he believes, believes voluntarily; our next inquiry, which we must conduct with care,
is, What faith it is which the apostle commends with so much earnestness? For indiscriminate
faith is not good. Accordingly we find this caution: “Brethren, believe not every spirit, but
try the spirits whether they are of God.”1016 Nor must the clause in commendation of love,
that it “believeth all things,”1017 be so understood as if we should detract from the love of
any one, if he refuses to believe at once what he hears. For the same love admonishes us that
we ought not readily to believe anything evil about a brother; and when anything of the kind
is said of him, does it not judge it to be more suitable to its character not to believe? Lastly,
the same love, “which believeth all things,” does not believe every spirit. Accordingly,
charity believes all things no doubt, but it believes in God. Observe, it is not said, Believes in
all things. It cannot therefore be doubted that the faith which is commended by the apostle
is the faith whereby we believe in God.1018</p>

<head>Chapter 56.—The Faith of Those Who are Under the Law Different from the Faith
of Others.</head>
<p>But there is yet another distinction to be observed,—since they who are under the law
both attempt to work their own righteousness through fear of punishment, and fail to do
God’s righteousness, because this is accomplished by the love to which only what is lawful
is pleasing, and never by the fear which is forced to have in its work the thing which is lawful,
although it has something else in its will which would prefer, if it were only possible, that
to be lawful which is not lawful. These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith
in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This,
however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: “Ye have not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
Abba, Father.”1019 The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though
there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is
feared. God’s children, however, exclaim, “Abba, Father,”—one of which words they of the
circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,—the Jew first, and then the
Greek;1020 since there is “one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision
through faith.”1021 When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and
what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but
that which is said of them, “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be filled?”1022 Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and
become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they
are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the
Only-begotten “gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on
His name;”1023 and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to
find, and to have the gate opened to them,1024 adding by way of rebuke, the words : “If ye,
being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father
which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?”1025 When, therefore, that
strength of sin, the law,1026 inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by

the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,1027 of whom were they to
ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children?
Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God
give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.1028 Why, then, does
he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ’s apostle, or even Christ
Himself, who says in His gospel, “Seek and ye shall find;”1029 and who also says to us,
speaking by His apostle: “If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in
faith, nothing wavering?”1030 This is the faith by which the just man lives;1031 this is the
faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;1032 this is the faith through
which boasting is excluded,1033 either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated,
or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by
which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: “We indeed through the
Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.”1034 But this admits of the further question,
Whether he meant by “the hope of righteousness” that by which righteousness hopes, or
that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes
undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness,
makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,1035 and hopes
to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God
by the psalm: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.”1036 This, moreover, is the faith
whereby they are saved to whom it is said: “By grace are ye saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are
His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained
that we should walk in them.”1037 This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but
by love;1038 not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore,

whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in
us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.1039 Now “the
love of God” is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because
He makes us lovers of Himself; just as “the righteousness of God”1040 is used in the sense of
our being made righteous by His gift; and “the salvation of the Lord,”1041 in that we are
saved by Him; and “the faith of Jesus Christ,”1042 because He makes us believers in Him.
This is that righteousness of God, which He not only teaches us by the precept of His law,

<head>Chapter 57 <del>XXXIII.</del>—Whence Comes the Will to Believe?</head>
<p>But it remains for us briefly to inquire, Whether the will by which we believe be itself
the gift of God, or whether it arise from that free will which is naturally implanted in us? If
we say that it is not the gift of God, we must then incur the fear of supposing that we have
discovered some answer to the apostle’s reproachful appeal: “What hast thou that thou didst
not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received
it?”1043—even some such an answer as this: “See, we have the will to believe, which we did
not receive. See in what we glory,—even in what we did not receive!” If, however, we were
to say that this kind of will is nothing but the gift of God, we should then have to fear lest
unbelieving and ungodly men might not unreasonably seem to have some fair excuse for
their unbelief, in the fact that God has refused to give them this will. Now this that the apostle
says, “It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of His own good pleasure,”1044
belongs already to that grace which faith secures, in order that good works may be within
the reach of man,—even the good works which faith achieves through the love which is shed
abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost which is given to us. If we believe that we may attain
this grace (and of course believe voluntarily), then the question arises whence we have this
will?—if from nature, why it is not at everybody’s command, since the same God made all
men? if from God’s gift, then again, why is not the gift open to all, since “He will have all
men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth?”1045</p>

<head>Chapter 58.—The Free Will of Man is an Intermediate Power.</head>
<p>Let us then, first of all, lay down this proposition, and see whether it satisfies the question
before us: that free will, naturally assigned by the Creator to our rational soul, is such a
neutral1046 power, as can either incline towards faith, or turn towards unbelief. Consequently
a man cannot be said to have even that will with which he believes in God, without having
received it; since this rises at the call of God out of the free will which he received naturally
when he was created. God no doubt wishes all men to be saved1047 and to come into the
knowledge of the truth; but yet not so as to take away from them free will, for the good or
the evil use of which they may be most righteously judged. This being the case, unbelievers
indeed do contrary to the will of God when they do not believe His gospel; nevertheless they
do not therefore overcome His will, but rob their own selves of the great, nay, the very
greatest, good, and implicate themselves in penalties of punishment, destined to experience
the power of Him in punishments whose mercy in His gifts they despised. Thus God’s will
is for ever invincible; but it would be vanquished, unless it devised what to do with such as
despised it, or if these despises could in any way escape from the retribution which He has
appointed for such as they. Suppose a master, for example, who should say to his servants,
I wish you to labour in my vineyard, and, after your work is done, to feast and take your
rest but who, at the same time, should require any who refused to work to grind in the mill
ever after. Whoever neglected such a command would evidently act contrary to the master’s
will; but he would do more than that,—he would vanquish that will, if he also escaped the
mill. This, however, cannot possibly happen under the government of God. Whence it is
written, “God hath spoken once,”—that is, irrevocably,—although the passage may refer
also to His one only Word.1048 He then adds what it is which He had irrevocably uttered,
saying: “Twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God. Also unto Thee, O Lord,
doth mercy belong: because Thou wilt render to every man according to his work.”1049 He
therefore will be guilty unto condemnation under God’s power, who shall think too contemptuously
of His mercy to believe in Him. But whosoever shall put his trust in Him, and
yield himself up to Him, for the forgiveness of all his sins, for the cure of all his corruption,
and for the kindling and illumination of his soul by His warmth and light, shall have good
works by his grace; and by them1050 he shall be even in his body redeemed from the corrup-

<head>Chapter 59.—Mercy and Pity in the Judgment of God.</head>
<p>This is the order observed in the psalm, where it is said: “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and
forget not all His recompenses; who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and
tender mercy; who satisfieth thy desire with good things.”1051 And lest by any chance these
great blessings should be despaired of under the deformity of our old, that is, mortal condition,
the Psalmist at once says, “Thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle’s;”1052 as much
as to say, All that you have heard belongs to the new man and to the new covenant. Now
let us consider together briefly these things, and with delight contemplate the praise of
mercy, that is, of the grace of God. “Bless the Lord, O my soul,” he says, “and forget not all
His recompenses.” Observe, he does not say blessings, but recompenses;1053 because He
recompenses evil with good. “Who forgiveth all thine iniquities:” this is done in the sacrament
of baptism. “Who healeth all thy diseases:” this is effected by the believer in the present life,
while the flesh so lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, that we do not the
things we would;1054 whilst also another law in our members wars against the law of our
mind;1055 whilst to will is present indeed to us but not how to perform that which is good.1056
These are the diseases of a man’s old nature which, however, if we only advance with persevering
purpose, are healed by the growth of the new nature day by day, by the faith which
operates through love.1057 “Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;” this will take place
at the resurrection of the dead in the last day. “Who crowneth thee with loving-kindness
and tender mercy;” this shall be accomplished in the day of judgment; for when the righteous
King shall sit upon His throne to render to every man according to his works, who shall
then boast of having a pure heart? or who shall glory of being clean from sin? It was therefore
necessary to mention God’s loving-kindness and tender mercy there, where one might expect
debts to be demanded and deserts recompensed so strictly as to leave no room for mercy.
He crowns, therefore, with loving-kindness and tender mercy; but even so according to
works. For he shall be separated to the right hand, to whom, it is said, “I was an hungered,
and ye gave me meat.”1058 There will, however, be also “judgment without mercy;” but it

will be for him “that hath not showed mercy.”1059 But “blessed are the merciful: for they
shall obtain mercy”1060 of God. Then, as soon as those on the left hand shall have gone into
eternal fire, the righteous, too, shall go into everlasting life,1061 because He says: “This is
life eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
sent.”1062 And with this knowledge, this vision, this contemplation, shall the desire of their
soul be satisfied; for it shall be enough for it to have this and nothing else,—there being
nothing more for it to desire, to aspire to, or to require. It was with a craving after this full
joy that his heart glowed who said to the Lord Christ, “Show us the Father, and it sufficeth
us;” and to whom the answer was returned, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.”
1063 Because He is Himself the eternal life, in order that men may know the one true God,
Thee and whom Thou hast sent, Jesus Christ. If, however, he that has seen the Son has also
seen the Father, then assuredly he who sees the Father and the Son sees also the Holy Spirit
of the Father and the Son. So we do not take away free will, whilst our soul blesses the Lord
and forgets not all His recompenses;1064 nor does it, in ignorance of God’s righteousness,
wish to set up one of its own;1065 but it believes in Him who justifies the ungodly,1066 and
until it arrives at sight, it lives by faith,—even the faith which works by love.1067 And this
love is shed abroad in our hearts, not by the sufficiency of our own will, nor by the letter of
the law, but by the Holy Ghost who has been given to us.1068</p>

<head>Chapter 60 <del>XXXIV.</del>—The Will to Believe is from God.</head>
<p>Let this discussion suffice, if it satisfactorily meets the question we had to solve. It may
be, however, objected in reply, that we must take heed lest some one should suppose that
the sin would have to be imputed to God which is committed by free will, if in the passage
where it is asked, “What hast thou which thou didst not receive?”1069 the very will by which
we believe is reckoned as a gift of God, because it arises out of the free will which we received
at our creation. Let the objector, however, attentively observe that this will is to be ascribed
to the divine gift, not merely because it arises from our free will, which was created naturally
with us; but also because God acts upon us by the incentives of our perceptions, to will and
to believe, either externally by evangelical exhortations, where even the commands of the
law also do something, if they so far admonish a man of his infirmity that he betakes himself
to the grace that justifies by believing; or internally, where no man has in his own control
what shall enter into his thoughts, although it appertains to his own will to consent or to
dissent. Since God, therefore, in such ways acts upon the reasonable soul in order that it
may believe in Him (and certainly there is no ability whatever in free will to believe, unless
there be persuasion or summons towards some one in whom to believe), it surely follows
that it is God who both works in man the willing to believe, and in all things prevents us
with His mercy. To yield our consent, indeed, to God’s summons, or to withhold it, is (as I
have said) the function of our own will. And this not only does not invalidate what is said,
“For what hast thou that thou didst not receive?”1070 but it really confirms it. For the soul
cannot receive and possess these gifts, which are here referred to, except by yielding its
consent. And thus whatever it possesses, and whatever it receives, is from God; and yet the
act of receiving and having belongs, of course, to the receiver and possessor. Now, should
any man be for constraining us to examine into this profound mystery, why this person is
so persuaded as to yield, and that person is not, there are only two things occurring to me,
which I should like to advance as my answer: “O the depth of the riches!”1071 and “Is there
unrighteousness with God?”1072 If the man is displeased with such an answer, he must seek
more learned disputants; but let him beware lest he find presumptuous ones.</p>

maintaining their own views with tenacity to listening to him, when he “beseeches them by
the mercies of God,” and tells them, “through the grace of God which was given to him, not
to think of themselves more highly than they ought to think, but to think soberly, according
as God had dealt to every man the measure of faith.”1073</p>

<head>Chapter 62.—He Returns to the Question Which Marcellinus Had Proposed to Him.</head>
<p>But I beg of you to advert to the question which you proposed to me, and to what we
have made out of it in the lengthy process of this discussion. You were perplexed how I
could have said that it was possible for a man to be without sin, if his will were not wanting,
by the help of God’s aid, although no man in the present life had ever lived, was living, or
would live, of such perfect righteousness. Now, in the books which I formerly addressed to
you, I set forth this very question. I said: “If I were asked whether it be possible for a man
to be without sin in this life, I should allow the possibility, by the grace of God, and his own
free will; for I should have no doubt that the free will itself is of God’s grace,—that is, has
its place among the gifts of God,—not only as to its existence, but also in respect of its
goodness; that is, that it applies itself to doing the commandments of God. And so, God’s
grace not only shows what ought to be done, but also helps to the possibility of doing what
it shows.”1074 You seemed to think it absurd, that a thing which was possible should be
unexampled. Hence arose the subject treated of in this book; and thus did it devolve on me
to show that a thing was possible although no example of it could be found. We accordingly
adduced certain cases out of the gospel and of the law, at the beginning of this work,—such
as the passing of a camel through the eye of a needle;1075 and the twelve thousand legions
of angels, who could fight for Christ, if He pleased;1076 and those nations which God said
He could have exterminated at once from the face of His people,1077—none of which possibilities
were ever reduced to fact. To these instances may be added those which are referred
to in the Book of Wisdom,1078 suggesting how many are the strange torments and troubles
which God was able to employ against ungodly men, by using the creature which was
obedient to His beck, which, however, He did not employ. One might also allude to that
mountain, which faith could remove into the sea,1079 although, nevertheless, it was never
done, so far as we have ever read1080 or heard. Now you see how thoughtless and foolish
would be the man who should say that any one of these things is impossible with God, and
how opposed to the sense of Scripture would be his assertion. Many other cases of this kind

<head>Chapter 63.—An Objection.</head>
<p>But inasmuch as it may be said that the instances which I have been quoting are divine
works, whereas to live righteously is a work that belongs to ourselves, I undertook to show
that even this too is a divine work. This I have done in the present book, with perhaps a
fuller statement than is necessary, although I seem to myself to have said too little against
the opponents of the grace of God. And I am never so much delighted in my treatment of
a subject as when Scripture comes most copiously to my aid; and when the question to be
discussed requires that “he that glorieth should glory in the Lord;”1081 and that we should
in all things lift up our hearts and give thanks to the Lord our God, from whom, “as the
Father of lights, every good and every perfect gift cometh down.”1082 Now if a gift is not
God’s gift, because it is wrought by us, or because we act by His gift, then it is not a work of
God that “a mountain should be removed into the sea,” inasmuch as, according to the Lord’s
statement, it is by the faith of men that this is possible. Moreover, He attributes the deed to
their actual operation: “If ye have faith in yourselves as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say
unto this mountain, “Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and it shall be done,
and nothing shall be impossible to you.”1083 Observe how He said “to you,” not “to Me” or
“to the Father;” and yet it is certain that no man does such a thing without God’s gift and
operation. See how an instance of perfect righteousness is unexampled among men, and
yet is not impossible. For it might be achieved if there were only applied so much of will as
suffices for so great a thing. There would, however, be so much will, if there were hidden
from us none of those conditions which pertain to righteousness; and at the same time these
so delighted our mind, that whatever hindrance of pleasure or pain might else occur, this
delight in holiness would prevail over every rival affection. And that this is not realized, is
not owing to any intrinsic impossibility, but to God’s judicial act. For who can be ignorant,
that what he should know is not in man’s power; nor does it follow that what he has discovered
to be a desirable object is actually desired, unless he also feel a delight in that object,
commensurate with its claims on his affection? For this belongs to health of soul.</p>

<head>Chapter 64 <del>XXXVI.</del>—When the Commandment to Love is Fulfilled.</head>
<p>But somebody will perhaps think that we lack nothing for the knowledge of righteousness,
since the Lord, when He summarily and briefly expounded His word on earth, informed
us that the whole law and the prophets depend on two commandments;1084 nor was He silent
as to what these were, but declared them in the plainest words: “Thou shall love,” said He,
“the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;” and
“Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”1085 What is more surely true than that, if these
be fulfilled, all righteousness is fulfilled? But the man who sets his mind on this truth must
also carefully attend to another,—in how many things we all of us offend,1086 while we
suppose that what we do is pleasant, or, at all events, not unpleasing, to God whom we love;
and afterwards, having (through His inspired word, or else by being warned in some clear
and certain way) learned what is not pleasing to Him, we pray to Him that He would forgive
us on our repentance. The life of man is full of examples of this. But whence comes it that
we fall short of knowing what is pleasing to Him, if it be not that He is to that extent unknown
to us? “For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.”1087 Who, however,
can make so bold, on arriving far enough, to say: “Then shall I know even as also I am
known,”1088 as to think that they who shall see God will have no greater love towards Him
than they have who now believe in Him? or that the one ought to be compared to the other,
as if they were very near to each other? Now, if love increases just in proportion as our
knowledge of its object becomes more intimate, of course we ought to believe that there is
as much wanting now to the fulfilment of righteousness as there is defective in our love of
it. A thing may indeed be known or believed, and yet not loved; but it is an impossibility
that a thing can be loved which is neither known nor believed. But if the saints, in the exercise
of their faith, could arrive at that great love, than which (as the Lord Himself testified) no
greater can possibly be exhibited in the present life,—even to lay down their lives for the
faith, or for their brethren,1089—then after their pilgrimage here, in which their walk is by
“faith,” when they shall have reached the “sight” of that final happiness1090 which we hope
for, though as yet we see it not, and wait for in patience,1091 then undoubtedly love itself
shall be not only greater than that which we here experience, but far higher than all which

we ask or think;1092 and yet it cannot be possibly more than “with all our heart, and with
all our soul, and with all our mind.” For there remains in us nothing which can be added
to the whole; since, if anything did remain, there would not be the whole. Therefore the first
commandment about righteousness, which bids us love the Lord with all our heart, and
soul, and mind1093 (the next to which is, that we love our neighbour as ourselves), we shall
completely fulfil in that life when we shall see face to face.1094 But even now this commandment
is enjoined upon us, that we may be reminded what we ought by faith to require, and
what we should in our hope look forward to, and, “forgetting the things which are behind,
reach forth to the things which are before.”1095 And thus, as it appears to me, that man has
made a far advance, even in the present life, in the righteousness which is to be perfected
hereafter, who has discovered by this very advance how very far removed he is from the
completion of righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter 65.—In What Sense a Sinless Righteousness in This Life Can Be Asserted.</head>
<p>Forasmuch, however, as an inferior righteousness may be said to be competent to this
life, whereby the just man lives by faith1096 although absent from the Lord, and, therefore,
walking by faith and not yet by sight,1097—it may be without absurdity said, no doubt, in
respect of it, that it is free from sin; for it ought not to be attributed to it as a fault, that it is
not as yet sufficient for so great a love to God as is due to the final, complete, and perfect
condition thereof. It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and
another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful
desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes
an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive
no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight
amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible
body, that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of
earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior
righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the
purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the
commandment is even now applicable: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;”1098 but in reference to the present life
the following: “Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts
thereof.”1099 To the one, again, belongs, “Thou shalt not covet;”1100 to the other, “Thou
shalt not go after thy lusts.”1101 To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to
continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it,
and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,—so that in the one the just
man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of
desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate
blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by
faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,—by committing not only frightful deeds and
crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened
to, or a tongue to a phrase which should not be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in
his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known
to be unlawful by the commandment,—for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would

certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)1102 Have such just men,
while living by faith, no need to say: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?”1103
And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, “In Thy sight shall no man living be
justified?”1104 and this: “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us?”1105 and, “There is no man that sinneth not;”1106 and again, “There is not on
the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not”1107 (for both these statements
are expressed in a general future sense,—“sinneth not,” “will not sin,”—not in the past time,
“has not sinned”)?—and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture?
Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that
whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to
the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it
is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;1108 and to forgive, that it may
be forgiven him;1109 and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of
himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and
thirsting for righteousness1110 from Him who is the living bread,1111 and with whom is the
fountain of life;1112 who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life,
their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally
when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.</p>

<head>Chapter 66.—Although Perfect Righteousness Be Not Found Here on Earth, It is
Still Not Impossible.</head>
<p>But let objectors find, if they can, any man, while living under the weight of this corruption,
in whom God has no longer anything to forgive; unless nevertheless they acknowledge
that such an individual has been aided in the attainment of his good character not merely
by the teaching of the law which God gave, but also by the infusion of the Spirit of grace—they
will incur the charge of ungodliness itself, not of this or that particular sin. Of course they
are not at all able to discover such a man, if they receive in a becoming manner the testimony
of the divine writings. Still, for all that, it must not by any means be said that the possibility
is lacking to God whereby the will of man can be so assisted, that there can be accomplished
in every respect even now in a man, not that righteousness only which is of faith,1113 but
that also in accordance with which we shall by and by have to live for ever in the very vision
of God. For if he should now wish even that this corruptible in any particular man should
put on incorruption,1114 and to command him so to live among mortal men (not destined
himself to die) that his old nature should be wholly and entirely withdrawn, and there should
be no law in his members warring against the law of his mind,1115—moreover, that he
should discover God to be everywhere present, as the saints shall hereafter know and behold
Him,—who will madly venture to affirm that this is impossible? Men, however, ask why He
does not do this; but they who raise the question consider not duly the fact that they are
human. I am quite certain that, as nothing is impossible with God1116 so also there is no
iniquity with Him.1117 Equally sure am I that He resists the proud, and gives grace to the
humble.1118 I know also that to him who had a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan
to buffet him, lest he should be exalted above measure, it was said, when he besought God
for its removal once, twice, nay thrice: “My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is
made perfect in weakness.”1119 There is, therefore, in the hidden depths of God’s judgments,
a certain reason why every mouth even of the righteous should be shut in its own praise,
and only opened for the praise of God. But what this certain reason is, who can search, who
investigate, who know? So “unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!

<p>“At that time also there came into my hands a certain book of Pelagius’, in which he
defends, with all the argumentative skill he could muster, the nature of man, in opposition
to the grace of God whereby the unrighteous is justified and we become Christians. The
treatise which contains my reply to him, and in which I defend grace, not indeed as in opposition
to nature, but as that which liberates and controls nature, I have entitled On Nature
and Grace. In this work sundry short passages, which were quoted by Pelagius as the words
of the Roman bishop and martyr, Xystus, were vindicated by myself1121 as if they really
were the words of this Sixtus. For this I thought them at the time; but I afterwards discovered,
that Sextus the heathen philosopher, and not Xystus the Christian bishop, was their author.

<head>Note on the Following Work.</head>
<p>In a letter (169th1122) to Evodius, written in the course of the year A.D. 415, Augustin
assigned to this work, On Nature and Grace, the last place of several treatises written in that
year. “I have also written,” says he, “an extensive book in opposition to the heresy of Pelagius,
at the request of some brethren, whom he had persuaded to accept a very pernicious opinion
against the grace of Christ.” The work had been begun, but was not completed, when
Orosius sailed from Africa to Palestine, in the spring of this year of 415; for, shortly after
his arrival there, at a council in Jerusalem, where Pelagius was present, he expressly affirmed,
“that the blessed Augustin had prepared a very complete answer to Pelagius’ book, two of
whose followers had presented the work to him, and requested him to reply to it.” Jerome,
also, at this time mentioned a certain production of Augustin’s, which he had not yet seen,
wherein it was said that he had expressly opposed Pelagius. His words, which occur in his
third dialogue against the heresy of Pelagius, are these: “It is said that he is preparing other
treatises likewise, especially against your name.” Augustin, however, did not actually employ
in this work of his the name of Pelagius, whose book he was refuting, in order that (as he
says in his letter <del>186th</del> to Paulinus) he might not by personal irritation drive him into a
more incurable degree of opposition; for he hoped to be of some service to his opponent, if
by still maintaining friendly terms with him he might be able to spare his feelings, although
he could not in duty show leniency to his writings. Thus, at least, he expresses his mind, in
his book On the Proceedings of Pelagius, ch. xxiii. No. 47. In this latter passage he subjoins
a letter which he had received from Timasius and Jacobus, containing the expression of
great gratitude to Augustin on receiving his volume On Nature and Grace, in which they
expressed “their agreeable surprise” at the answers he had furnished to them “on every
point” of the Pelagian controversy.</p>
<p>In the following year Augustin despatched this work, along with Pelagius’ own book,
to John, bishop of Jerusalem, in order that that prelate might at length become acquainted
with the views of the new heresiarch, accompanying the books with a letter to the bishop
<del>179th</del>. In the course of this year 416, he had the same two treatises (his own and Pelagius’)
forwarded to Pope Innocent, with a letter <del>177th</del> sent in the name of five bishops, to which
Innocent returned an answer <del>183d</del>. It may be here stated, that in this last-mentioned letter
<del>183, n. 5</del>, and in the foregoing epistle <del>177, n. 6</del>, there is honourable mention made of
Timasius and Jacobus, as “conscientious and honourable young men, servants of God, who
had relinquished the hope which they had in the world, and continued diligently to serve
God.” The same persons are described in another epistle <del>179, n. 2</del> as “young men of very

<pb n="399"/>
honourable birth, and highly educated;” and in the work On the Proceedings of Pelagius, ch.
xxiii. No. 47, they are called “servants of God, good, and honourable men.”</p>
<p>Julianus <del>who espoused the side of Pelagius</del>, in his work addressed to Florus (book iv.
n. 112, of the Imperfect Work),1123 quotes this treatise of Augustin’s as addressed to Timasius,
and calumniously pronounces it to be written “against free will.”</p>

<head>A TREATISE ON NATURE AND GRACE, AGAINST PELAGIUS;</head>
<p>BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;
Contained in One Book, addressed to timasius and jacobus.</p>
<p>WRITTEN IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 415.</p>
<p>He begins with a statement of what is to be investigated concerning nature and grace; he shows
that nature, as propagated from the flesh of the sinful Adam, being no longer what God
made it at first,—faultless and sound,—requires the aid of grace, in order that it may be
redeemed from the wrath of God and regulated for the perfection of righteousness: that
the penal fault of nature leads to a most righteous retribution: whilst grace itself is not
rendered to any deserts of ours, but is given gratuitously; and they who are not delivered
by it are justly condemned. He afterwards refutes, with answers on every several point, a
work by Pelagius, who supports this self-same nature in opposition to grace; among other
things especially, in his desire to recommend the opinion that a man can live without sin,
he contended that nature had not been weakened and changed by sin; for, otherwise, the
matter of sin (which he thinks absurd) would be its punishment, if the sinner were
weakened to such a degree that he committed more sin. He goes on to enumerate sundry
righteous men both of the Old and of the New Testaments: deeming these to have been
free from sin, he alleged the possibility of not sinning to be inherent in man; and this he
attributed to God’s grace, on the ground that God is the author of that nature in which
is inseparably inherent this possibility of avoiding sin. Towards the end of this treatise
there is an examination of sundry extracts from old writers, which Pelagius adduced in
support of his views, and expressly from Hilary, Ambrose, and even Augustin himself.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—The Occasion of Publishing This Work; What God’s Righteousness
is.</head>
<p>The book which you sent to me, my beloved sons, Timasius and Jacobus, I have read
through hastily, but not indifferently, omitting only the few points which are plain enough
to everybody; and I saw in it a man inflamed with most ardent zeal against those, who, when
in their sins they ought to censure human will, are more forward in accusing the nature of
men, and thereby endeavour to excuse themselves. He shows too great a fire against this
evil, which even authors of secular literature have severely censured with the exclamation:
“The human race falsely complains of its own nature!”1124 This same sentiment your author
also has strongly insisted upon, with all the powers of his talent. I fear, however, that he will
chiefly help those “who have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge,” who, “being
ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have
not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.”1125 Now, what the righteousness
of God is, which is spoken of here, he immediately afterwards explains by adding: “For
Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”1126 This righteousness
of God, therefore, lies not in the commandment of the law, which excites fear, but in
the aid afforded by the grace of Christ, to which alone the fear of the law, as of a schoolmaster,
1127 usefully conducts. Now, the man who understands this understands why he is a
Christian. For “If righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.”1128 If, however
He did not die in vain, in Him only is the ungodly man justified, and to him, on believing
in Him who justifies the ungodly, faith is reckoned for righteousness.1129 For all men have
sinned and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His blood.1130 But all
those who do not think themselves to belong to the “all who have sinned and fall short of
the glory of God,” have of course no need to become Christians, because “they that be whole
need not a physician, but they that are sick;”1131 whence it is, that He came not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.1132</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—Faith in Christ Not Necessary to Salvation, If a Man Without It
Can Lead a Righteous Life.</head>
<p>Therefore the nature of the human race, generated from the flesh of the one transgressor,
if it is self-sufficient for fulfilling the law and for perfecting righteousness, ought to be sure
of its reward, that is, of everlasting life, even if in any nation or at any former time faith in
the blood of Christ was unknown to it. For God is not so unjust as to defraud righteous
persons of the reward of righteousness, because there has not been announced to them the
mystery of Christ’s divinity and humanity, which was manifested in the flesh.1133 For how
could they believe what they had not heard of; or how could they hear without a preacher?1134
For “faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.” But I say (adds he): Have
they not heard? “Yea, verily; their sound went out into all the earth, and their words unto
the ends of the world.”1135 Before, however, all this had been accomplished, before the actual
preaching of the gospel reaches the ends of all the earth—because there are some remote
nations still (although it is said they are very few) to whom the preached gospel has not
found its way,—what must human nature do, or what has it done—for it had either not
heard that all this was to take place, or has not yet learnt that it was accomplished—but believe
in God who made heaven and earth, by whom also it perceived by nature that it had been
itself created, and lead a right life, and thus accomplish His will, uninstructed with any faith
in the death and resurrection of Christ? Well, if this could have been done, or can still be
done, then for my part I have to say what the apostle said in regard to the law: “Then Christ
died in vain.”1136 For if he said this about the law, which only the nation of the Jews received,
how much more justly may it be said of the law of nature, which the whole human race has
received, “If righteousness come by nature, then Christ died in vain.” If, however, Christ
did not die in vain, then human nature cannot by any means be justified and redeemed
from God’s most righteous wrath—in a word, from punishment—except by faith and the
sacrament of the blood of Christ.</p>

<p>Man’s nature, indeed, was created at first faultless and without any sin; but that nature
of man in which every one is born from Adam, now wants the Physician, because it is not
sound. All good qualities, no doubt, which it still possesses in its make, life, senses, intellect,
it has of the Most High God, its Creator and Maker. But the flaw, which darkens and
weakens all those natural goods, so that it has need of illumination and healing, it has not
contracted from its blameless Creator—but from that original sin, which it committed by
free will. Accordingly, criminal nature has its part in most righteous punishment. For, if we
are now newly created in Christ,1137 we were, for all that, children of wrath, even as others,
1138 “but God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when
we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we were
saved.”1139</p>

not liberated through grace, either because they are not yet able to hear, or because they are
unwilling to obey; or again because they did not receive, at the time when they were unable
on account of youth to hear, that bath of regeneration, which they might have received and
through which they might have been saved, are indeed justly condemned; because they are
not without sin, either that which they have derived from their birth, or that which they
have added from their own misconduct. “For all have sinned”—whether in Adam or in
themselves—“and come short of the glory of God.”1141</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="408"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—A Distinction Drawn by Pelagius Between the Possible and Actual.</head>
<p>For he first of all makes a distinction: “It is one thing,” says he, “to inquire whether a
thing can be, which has respect to its possibility only; and another thing, whether or not it
is.” This distinction, nobody doubts, is true enough; for it follows that whatever is, was able
to be; but it does not therefore follow that what is able to be, also is. Our Lord, for instance,
raised Lazarus; He unquestionably was able to do so. But inasmuch as He did not raise up
Judas1146 must we therefore contend that He was unable to do so? He certainly was able,
but He would not. For if He had been willing, He could have effected this too. For the Son
quickeneth whomsoever He will.1147 Observe, however, what he means by this distinction,
true and manifest enough in itself, and what he endeavours to make out of it. “We are
treating,” says he, “of possibility only; and to pass from this to something else, except in the
case of some certain fact, we deem to be a very serious and extraordinary process.” This idea
he turns over again and again, in many ways and at great length, so that no one would suppose
that he was inquiring about any other point than the possibility of not committing sin.
Among the many passages in which he treats of this subject, occurs the following: “I once
more repeat my position: I say that it is possible for a man to be without sin. What do you
say? That it is impossible for a man to be without sin? But I do not say,” he adds, “that there
is a man without sin; nor do you say, that there is not a man without sin. Our contention is
about what is possible, and not possible; not about what is, and is not.” He then enumerates
certain passages of Scripture,1148 which are usually alleged in opposition to them, and insists
that they have nothing to do with the question, which is really in dispute, as to the possibility
or impossibility of a man’s being without sin. This is what he says: “No man indeed is clean
from pollution; and, There is no man that sinneth not; and, There is not a just man upon
the earth; and, There is none that doeth good. There are these and similar passages in
Scripture,” says he, “but they testify to the point of not being, not of not being able; for by
testimonies of this sort it is shown what kind of persons certain men were at such and such
a time, not that they were unable to be something else. Whence they are justly found to be
blameworthy. If, however, they had been of such a character, simply because they were unable
to be anything else, they are free from blame.”</p>

<head>Chapter 9 <del>VIII.</del>—Even They Who Were Not Able to Be Justified are Condemned.</head>
<p>See what he has said. I, however, affirm that an infant born in a place where it was not
possible for him to be admitted to the baptism of Christ, and being overtaken by death, was
placed in such circumstances, that is to say, died without the bath of regeneration, because
it was not possible for him to be otherwise. He would therefore absolve him, and, in spite
of the Lord’s sentence, open to him the kingdom of heaven. The apostle, however, does not
absolve him, when he says: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; by
which death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”1149 Rightly, therefore, by virtue
of that condemnation which runs throughout the mass, is he not admitted into the kingdom
of heaven, although he was not only not a Christian, but was unable to become one.</p>

<head>Chapter 10 <del>IX.</del>—He Could Not Be Justified, Who Had Not Heard of the Name of
Christ; Rendering the Cross of Christ of None Effect.</head>
<p>But they say: “He is not condemned; because the statement that all sinned in Adam,
was not made because of the sin which is derived from one’s birth, but because of imitation
of him.” If, therefore, Adam is said to be the author of all the sins which followed his own,
because he was the first sinner of the human race, then how is it that Abel, rather than Christ,
is not placed at the head of all the righteous, because he was the first righteous man? But I
am not speaking of the case of an infant. I take the instance of a young man, or an old man,
who has died in a region where he could not hear of the name of Christ. Well, could such
a man have become righteous by nature and free will; or could he not? If they contend that
he could, then see what it is to render the cross of Christ of none effect,1150 to contend that
any man without it, can be justified by the law of nature and the power of his will. We may
here also say, then is Christ dead in vain1151 forasmuch as all might accomplish so much
as this, even if He had never died; and if they should be unrighteous, they would be so because
they wished to be, not because they were unable to be righteous. But even though a man
could not be justified at all without the grace of Christ, he would absolve him, if he dared,
in accordance with his words, to the effect that, “if a man were of such a character, because
he could not possibly have been of any other, he would be free from all blame.”</p>

<head>Chapter 11 <del>X.</del>—Grace Subtly Acknowledged by Pelagius.</head>
<p>He then starts an objection to his own position, as if, indeed, another person had raised
it, and says: “‘A man,’ you will say, ‘may possibly be [without sin]; but it is by the grace of
God.’” He then at once subjoins the following, as if in answer to his own suggestion: “I thank
you for your kindness, because you are not merely content to withdraw your opposition to
my statement, which you just now opposed, or barely to acknowledge it; but you actually
go so far as to approve it. For to say, ‘A man may possibly, but by this or by that,’ is in fact
nothing else than not only to assent to its possibility, but also to show the mode and condition
of its possibility. Nobody, therefore, gives a better assent to the possibility of anything than
the man who allows the condition thereof; because, without the thing itself, it is not possible
for a condition to be.” After this he raises another objection against. himself: “But, you will
say, ‘you here seem to reject the grace of God, inasmuch as you do not even mention it;’”
and he then answers the objection: “Now, is it I that reject grace, who by acknowledging
the thing must needs also confess the means by which it may be effected, or you, who by
denying the thing do undoubtedly also deny whatever may be the means through which the
thing is accomplished?” He forgot that he was now answering one who does not deny the
thing, and whose objection he had just before set forth in these words: “A man may possibly
be [without sin]; but it is by the grace of God.” How then does that man deny the possibility,
in defence of which his opponent earnestly contends, when he makes the admission to that
opponent that “the thing is possible, but only by the grace of God?” That, however, after he
is dismissed who already acknowledges the essential thing, he still has a question against
those who maintain the impossibility of a man’s being without sin, what is it to us? Let him
ply his questions against any opponents he pleases, provided he only confesses this, which
cannot be denied without the most criminal impiety, that without the grace of God a man
cannot be without sin. He says, indeed: “Whether he confesses it to be by grace, or by aid,
or by mercy, whatever that be by which a man can be without sin,—every one acknowledges
the thing itself.”</p>

he did not deny the grace of God by which alone a man can be justified; for it is this which
I mainly detest and dread in discussions of this kind. But when I went on to read the rest, I
began to have my suspicions, first of all, from the similes he employs. For he says: “If I were
to say, man is able to dispute; a bird is able to fly; a hare is able to run; without mentioning
at the same time the instruments by which these acts can be accomplished—that is, the
tongue, the wings, and the legs; should I then have denied the conditions of the various offices,
when I acknowledged the very offices themselves?” It is at once apparent that he has
here instanced such things as are by nature efficient; for the members of the bodily structure
which are here mentioned are created with natures of such a kind—the tongue, the wings,
the legs. He has not here posited any such thing as we wish to have understood by grace,
without which no man is justified; for this is a topic which is concerned about the cure, not
the constitution, of natural functions. Entertaining, then, some apprehensions, I proceeded
to read all the rest, and I soon found that my suspicions had not been unfounded.</p>

<p>But before I proceed further, see what he has said. When treating the question about
the difference of sins, and starting as an objection to himself, what certain persons allege,
“that some sins are light by their very frequency, their constant irruption making it impossible
that they should be all of them avoided;” he thereupon denied that it was “proper that they
should be censured even as light offences, if they cannot possibly be wholly avoided.” He
of course does not notice the Scriptures of the New Testament, wherein we learn1152 that
the intention of the law in its censure is this, that, by reason of the transgressions which
men commit, they may flee for refuge to the grace of the Lord, who has pity upon them—“the
schoolmaster”1153 “shutting them up unto the same faith which should afterwards be revealed;”
1154 that by it their transgressions may be forgiven, and then not again be committed,
by God’s assisting grace. The road indeed belongs to all who are progressing in it; although
it is they who make a good advance that are called “perfect travellers.” That, however, is the
height of perfection which admits of no addition, when the goal to which men tend has begun
to be possessed.</p>

So Many Words.</head>
<p>That, too, which is said to him, “that it is nowhere written in so many words, A man
can be without sin,” he easily refutes thus: “That the question here is not in what precise
words each doctrinal statement is made.” It is perhaps not without reason that, while in
several passages of Scripture we may find it said that men are without excuse, it is nowhere
found that any man is described as being without sin, except Him only, of whom it is plainly
said, that “He knew no sin.”1156 Similarly, we read in the passage where the subject is concerning
priests: “He was in all points tempted like as we are, only without
sin,”1157—meaning, of course, in that flesh which bore the likeness of sinful flesh, although
it was not sinful flesh; a likeness, indeed, which it would not have borne if it had not been
in every other respect the same as sinful flesh. How, however, we are to understand this:
“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; neither can he sin, for his seed remaineth
in him;”1158 while the Apostle John himself, as if he had not been born of God, or else were
addressing men who had not been born of God, lays down this position: “If we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,”1159—I have already explained,
with such care as I was able, in those books which I wrote to Marcellinus on this very sub-
ject.1160 It seems, moreover, to me to be an interpretation worthy of acceptance to regard
the clause of the above quoted passage: “Neither can he sin,” as if it meant: He ought not to
commit sin. For who could be so foolish as to say that sin ought to be committed, when, in
fact, sin is sin, for no other reason than that it ought not to be committed?</p>

<head>Chapter 16 <del>XV.</del>—Pelagius Corrupts a Passage of the Apostle James by Adding a
Note of Interrogation.</head>
<p>Now that passage, in which the Apostle James says: “But the tongue can no man
tame,”1161 does not appear to me to be capable of the interpretation which he would put
upon it, when he expounds it, “as if it were written by way of reproach; as much as to say:
Can no man then, tame the tongue? As if in a reproachful tone, which would say: You are
able to tame wild beasts; cannot you tame the tongue? As if it were an easier thing to tame
the tongue than to subjugate wild beasts.” I do not think that this is the meaning of the
passage. For, if he had meant such an opinion as this to be entertained of the facility of
taming the tongue, there would have followed in the sequel of the passage a comparison of
that member with the beasts. As it is, however, it simply goes on to say: “The tongue is an
unruly evil, full of deadly poison,”1162—such, of course, as is more noxious than that of
beasts and creeping things. For while the one destroys the flesh, the other kills the soul. For,
“The mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.”1163 It is not, therefore, as if this is an easier
achievement than the taming of beasts that St. James pronounced the statement before us,
or would have others utter it; but he rather aims at showing what a great evil in man his
tongue is—so great, indeed, that it cannot be tamed by any man, although even beasts are
tameable by human beings. And he said this, not with a view to our permitting, through
our neglect, the continuance of so great an evil to ourselves, but in order that we might be
induced to request the help of divine grace for the taming of the tongue. For he does not
say: “None can tame the tongue;” but “No man;” in order that, when it is tamed, we may
acknowledge it to be effected by the mercy of God, the help of God, the grace of God. The
soul, therefore, should endeavour to tame the tongue, and while endeavouring should pray
for assistance; the tongue, too, should beg for the taming of the tongue,—He being the tamer
who said to His disciples: “It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
speaketh in you.”1164 Thus, we are warned by the precept to do this,—namely, to make the
attempt, and, failing in our own strength, to pray for the help of God.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after emphatically describing the evil of the tongue—saying, among other
things: “My brethren, these things ought not so to be”1165—he at once, after finishing some
remarks which arose out of his subject, goes on to add this advice, showing by what help
those things would not happen, which (as he said) ought not: “Who is a wise man and endowed
with knowledge among you? Let him show out of a good conversation his works
with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not
and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
devilish. For where there is envying and strife, there is confusion and every evil work. But
the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated,
full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.”1166 This is the
wisdom which tames the tongue; it descends from above, and springs from no human heart.
Will any one, then, dare to divorce it from the grace of God, and with most arrogant vanity
place it in the power of man? Why should I pray to God that it be accorded me, if it may be
had of man? Ought we not to object to this prayer lest injury be done to free will which is
self-sufficient in the possibility of nature for discharging all the duties of righteousness? We
ought, then, to object also to the Apostle James himself, who admonishes us in these words:
“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
not, and it shall be given him; but let him ask in faith, nothing doubting.”1167 This is the
faith to which the commandments drive us, in order that the law may prescribe our duty
and faith accomplish it.1168 For through the tongue, which no man can tame, but only the
wisdom which comes down from above, “in many things we all of us offend.”1169 For this
truth also the same apostle pronounced in no other sense than that in which he afterwards
declares: “The tongue no man can tame.”1170</p>

<head>Chapter 18 <del>XVII.</del>—Who May Be Said to Be in the Flesh.</head>
<p>There is a passage which nobody could place against these texts with the similar purpose
of showing the impossibility of not sinning: “The wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God;
for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; so then they that are in the flesh
cannot please God;”1171 for he here mentions the wisdom of the flesh, not the wisdom which
cometh from above: moreover, it is manifest, that in this passage, by the phrase, “being in
the flesh,” are signified, not those who have not yet quitted the body, but those who live
according to the flesh. The question, however, we are discussing does not lie in this point.
But what I want to hear from him, if I can, is about those who live according to the Spirit,
and who on this account are not, in a certain sense, in the flesh, even while they still live
here,—whether they, by God’s grace, live according to the Spirit, or are sufficient for themselves,
natural capability having been bestowed on them when they were created, and their
own proper will besides. Whereas the fulfilling of the law is nothing else than love;1172 and
God’s love is shed abroad in our hearts, not by our own selves, but by the Holy Ghost which
is given to us.1173</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Sins of Ignorance; To Whom Wisdom is Given by God on Their Requesting
It.</head>
<p>He further treats of sins of ignorance, and says that “a man ought to be very careful to
avoid ignorance; and that ignorance is blameworthy for this reason, because it is through
his own neglect that a man is ignorant of that which he certainly must have known if he had
only applied diligence;” whereas he prefers disputing all things rather than to pray, and say:
“Give me understanding, that I may learn Thy commandments.”1174 It is, indeed, one thing
to have taken no pains to know what sins of negligence were apparently expiated even
through divers sacrifices of the law; it is another thing to wish to understand, to be unable,
and then to act contrary to the law, through not understanding what it would have done.
We are accordingly enjoined to ask of God wisdom, “who giveth to all men liberally;”1175
that is, of course, to all men who ask in such a manner, and to such an extent, as so great a
matter requires in earnestness of petition.</p>

<head>Chapter 20 <del>XVIII.</del>—What Prayer Pelagius Would Admit to Be Necessary.</head>
<p>He confesses that “sins which have been committed do notwithstanding require to be
divinely expiated, and that the Lord must be entreated because of them,”—that is, for the
purpose, of course, of obtaining pardon; “because that which has been done cannot,” it is
his own admission, “be undone,” by that “power of nature and will of man” which he talks
about so much. From this necessity, therefore, it follows that a man must pray to be forgiven.
That a man, however, requires to be helped not to sin, he has nowhere admitted; I read no
such admission in this passage; he keeps a strange silence on this subject altogether; although
the Lord’s Prayer enjoins upon us the necessity of praying both that our debts may be remitted
to us, and that we may not be led into temptation,—the one petition entreating that past
offences may be atoned for; the other, that future ones may be avoided. Now, although this
is never done unless our will be assistant, yet our will alone is not enough to secure its being
done; the prayer, therefore, which is offered up to God for this result is neither superfluous
nor offensive to the Lord. For what is more foolish than to pray that you may do that which
you have it in your own power to do.</p>

<head>Chapter 21 <del>XIX.</del>—Pelagius Denies that Human Nature Has Been Depraved or
Corrupted by Sin.</head>
<p>You may now see (what bears very closely on our subject) how he endeavours to exhibit
human nature, as if it were wholly without fault, and how he struggles against the plainest
of God’s Scriptures with that “wisdom of word”1176 which renders the cross of Christ of
none effect. That cross, however, shall certainly never be made of none effect; rather shall
such wisdom be subverted. Now, after we shall have demonstrated this, it may be that God’s
mercy may visit him, so that he may be sorry that he ever said these things: “We have,” he
says, “first of all to discuss the position which is maintained, that our nature has been
weakened and changed by sin. I think,” continues he, “that before all other things we have
to inquire what sin is,—some substance, or wholly a name without substance, whereby is
expressed not a thing, not an existence, not some sort of a body, but the doing of a wrongful
deed.” He then adds: “I suppose that this is the case; and if so,” he asks, “how could that
which lacks all substance have possibly weakened or changed human nature?” Observe, I
beg of you, how in his ignorance he struggles to overthrow the most salutary words of the
remedial Scriptures: “I said, O Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned
against Thee.”1177 Now, how can a thing be healed, if it is not wounded nor hurt, nor
weakened and corrupted? But, as there is here something to be healed, whence did it receive
its injury? You hear [the Psalmist] confessing the fact; what need is there of discussion? He
says: “Heal my soul.” Ask him how that which he wants to be healed became injured, and
then listen to his following words: “Because I have sinned against Thee.” Let him, however,
put a question, and ask what he deemed a suitable inquiry, and say: “O you who exclaim,
Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee! pray tell me what sin is? Some substance, or
wholly a name without substance, whereby is expressed, not a thing, not an existence, not
some sort of a body, but merely the doing of a wrongful deed?” Then the other returns for
answer: “It is even as you say; sin is not some substance; but under its name there is merely
expressed the doing of a wrongful deed.” But he rejoins: “Then why cry out, Heal my soul,
for I have sinned against Thee? How could that have possibly corrupted your soul which
lacks all substance?” Then would the other, worn out with the anguish of his wound, in order
to avoid being diverted from prayer by the discussion, briefly answer and say: “Go from me,
I beseech you; rather discuss the point, if you can, with Him who said: ‘They that are whole
need no physician, but they that are sick; I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners,’”
1178—in which words, of course, He designated the righteous as the whole, and sinners as
the sick.</p>

<head>Chapter 22 <del>XX.</del>—How Our Nature Could Be Vitiated by Sin, Even Though It Be
Not a Substance.</head>
<p>Now, do you not perceive the tendency and direction of this controversy? Even to render
of none effect the Scripture where it is said “Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall
save His people from their sins.”1179 For how is He to save where there is no malady? For
the sins, from which this gospel says Christ’s people have to be saved, are not substances,
and according to this writer are incapable of corrupting. O brother, how good a thing it is
to remember that you are a Christian! To believe, might perhaps be enough; but still, since
you persist in discussion, there is no harm, nay there is even benefit, if a firm faith precede
it; let us not suppose, then, that human nature cannot be corrupted by sin, but rather, believing,
from the inspired Scriptures, that it is corrupted by sin, let our inquiry be how this could
possibly have come about. Since, then, we have already learnt that sin is not a substance, do
we not consider, not to mention any other example, that not to eat is also not a substance?
Because such abstinence is withdrawal from a substance, inasmuch as food is a substance.
To abstain, then, from food is not a substance; and yet the substance of our body, if it does
altogether abstain from food, so languishes, is so impaired by broken health, is so exhausted
of strength, so weakened and broken with very weariness, that even if it be in any way able
to continue alive, it is hardly capable of being restored to the use of that food, by abstaining
from which it became so corrupted and injured. In the same way sin is not a substance; but
God is a substance, yea the height of substance and only true sustenance of the reasonable
creature. The consequence of departing from Him by disobedience, and of inability, through
infirmity, to receive what one ought really to rejoice in, you hear from the Psalmist, when
he says: “My heart is smitten and withered like grass, since I have forgotten to eat my
bread.”1180</p>

<head>Chapter 23 <del>XXI.</del>—Adam Delivered by the Mercy of Christ.</head>
<p>But observe how, by specious arguments, he continues to oppose the truth of Holy
Scripture. The Lord Jesus, who is called Jesus because He saves His people from their sins,1181
in accordance with this His merciful character, says: “They that be whole need not a physician,
but they that are sick; I am come not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”1182
Accordingly, His apostle also says: “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.”1183 This man, however, contrary to
the “faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,” declares that “this sickness ought not to
have been contracted by sins, lest the punishment of sin should amount to this, that more
sins should be committed.” Now even for infants the help of the Great Physician is sought.
This writer asks: “Why seek Him? They are whole for whom you seek the Physician. Not
even was the first man condemned to die for any such reason, for he did not sin afterwards.”
As if he had ever heard anything of his subsequent perfection in righteousness, except so
far as the Church commends to our faith that even Adam was delivered by the mercy of the
Lord Christ. “As to his posterity also,” says he, “not only are they not more infirm than he,
but they actually fulfilled more commandments than he ever did, since he neglected to fulfil
one,”—this posterity which he sees so born (as Adam certainly was not made), not only incapable
of commandment, which they do not at all understand, but hardly capable of
sucking the breast, when they are hungry! Yet even these would He have to be saved in the
bosom of Mother Church by His grace who saves His people from their sins; but these men
gainsay such grace, and, as if they had a deeper insight into the creature than ever He possesses
who made the creature, they pronounce [these infants] sound with an assertion which
is anything but sound itself.</p>

<head>Chapter 24 <del>XXII.</del>—Sin and the Penalty of Sin the Same.</head>
<p>“The very matter,” says he, “of sin is its punishment, if the sinner is so much weakened
that he commits more sins.” He does not consider how justly the light of truth forsakes the
man who transgresses the law. When thus deserted he of course becomes blinded, and necessarily
offends more; and by so falling is embarrassed and being embarrassed fails to rise,
so as to hear the voice of the law, which admonishes him to beg for the Saviour’s grace. Is
no punishment due to them of whom the apostle says: “Because that, when they knew God,
they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations,
and their foolish heart was darkened?”1184 This darkening was, of course, already their
punishment and penalty; and yet by this very penalty—that is, by their blindness of heart,
which supervenes on the withdrawal of the light of wisdom—they fell into more grievous
sins still. “For giving themselves out as wise, they became fools.” This is a grievous penalty,
if one only understands it; and from such a penalty only see to what lengths they ran: “And
they changed,” he says, “the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to
corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.”1185 All this
they did owing to that penalty of their sin, whereby “their foolish heart was darkened.” And
yet, owing to these deeds of theirs, which, although coming in the way of punishment, were
none the less sins (he goes on to say): “Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness,
through the lusts of their own hearts.”1186 See how severely God condemned them, giving
them over to uncleanness in the very desires of their heart. Observe also the sins they commit
owing to such condemnation: “To dishonour,” says he, “their own bodies among themselves.”
1187 Here is the punishment of iniquity, which is itself iniquity; a fact which sets
forth in a clearer light the words which follow: “Who changed the truth of God into a lie,
and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
Amen.” “For this cause,” says he, “God gave them up unto vile affections.”1188 See how often
God inflicts punishment; and out of the self-same punishment sins, more numerous and
more severe, arise. “For even their women did change the natural use into that which is
against nature; and likewise the men also, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in
their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly.”1189 Then,
to show that these things were so sins themselves, that they were also the penalties of sins,
he further says: “And receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was

meet.”1190 Observe how often it happens that the very punishment which God inflicts begets
other sins as its natural offspring. Attend still further: “And even as they did not like to retain
God in their knowledge,” says he, “God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
things which are not convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity;
whisperers, backbiters, odious to God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things,
disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmerciful.”1191 Here, now, let our opponent say: “Sin ought not so to have
been punished, that the sinner, through his punishment, should commit even more sins.”</p>

<head>Chapter 25 <del>XXIII.</del>—God Forsakes Only Those Who Deserve to Be Forsaken. We
are Sufficient of Ourselves to Commit Sin; But Not to Return to the Way of
Righteousness. Death is the Punishment, Not the Cause of Sin.</head>
<p>Perhaps he may answer that God does not compel men to do these things, but only
forsakes those who deserve to be forsaken. If he does say this, he says what is most true. For,
as I have already remarked, those who are forsaken by the light of righteousness, and are
therefore groping in darkness, produce nothing else than those works of darkness which I
have enumerated, until such time as it is said to them, and they obey the command: “Awake
thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.”1192 The truth
designates them as dead; whence the passage: “Let the dead bury their dead.” The truth,
then, designates as dead those whom this man declares to have been unable to be damaged
or corrupted by sin, on the ground, forsooth, that he has discovered sin to be no substance!
Nobody tells him that “man was so formed as to be able to pass from righteousness to sin,
and yet not able to return from sin to righteousness.” But that free will, whereby man corrupted
his own self, was sufficient for his passing into sin; but to return to righteousness,
he has need of a Physician, since he is out of health; he has need of a Vivifier, because he is
dead. Now about such grace as this he says not a word, as if he were able to cure himself by
his own will, since this alone was able to ruin him. We do not tell him that the death of the
body is of efficacy for sinning, because it is only its punishment; for no one sins by undergoing
the death of his body; but the death of the soul is conducive to sin, forsaken as it is
by its life, that is, its God; and it must needs produce dead works, until it revives by the grace
of Christ. God forbid that we should assert that hunger and thirst and other bodily sufferings
necessarily produce sin. When exercised by such vexations, the life of the righteous only
shines out with greater lustre, and procures a greater glory by overcoming them through
patience; but then it is assisted by the grace, it is assisted by the Spirit, it is assisted by the
mercy of God; not exalting itself in an arrogant will, but earning fortitude by a humble
confession. For it had learnt to say unto God: “Thou art my hope; Thou art my trust.”1193
Now, how it happens that concerning this grace, and help and mercy, without which we
cannot live, this man has nothing to say, I am at a loss to know; but he goes further, and in
the most open manner gainsays the grace of Christ whereby we are justified, by insisting
on the sufficiency of nature to work righteousness, provided only the will be present. The
reason, however, why, after sin has been released to the guilty one by grace, for the exercise
of faith, there should still remain the death of the body, although it proceeds from sin, I

death of His own power; and this is our price which He paid to redeem us from death.
Now, this truth their contention labours hard to make of none effect; for human nature is
maintained by them to be such, that with free will it wants no such ransom in order to be
translated from the power of darkness and of him who has the power of death,1195 into the
kingdom of Christ the Lord.1196 And yet, when the Lord drew near His passion, He said,
“Behold, the prince of this world cometh and shall find nothing in me,”1197—and therefore
no sin, of course, on account of which he might exercise dominion over Him, so as to destroy
Him. “But,” added He, “that the world may know that I do the will of my Father, arise, let
us go hence;”1198 as much as to say, I am going to die, not through the necessity of sin, but

“Thou didst hide Thy face from me, and I was troubled?”1199 Certainly not; and yet this
very trouble was to him in a certain manner a remedy against his pride. For he had said in
his prosperity, “I shall never be moved;”1200 and so was ascribing to himself what he was
receiving from the Lord. “For what had he that he did not receive?”1201 It had, therefore,
become necessary to show him whence he had received, that he might receive in humility
what he had lost in pride. Accordingly, he says, “In Thy good pleasure, O Lord, Thou didst
add strength to my beauty.”1202 In this abundance of mine I once used to say, “I shall not

Heretics Our Business Ought Not to Be Disputation, But Prayer.</head>
<p>Man’s proud mind has no relish at all for this; God, however, is great, in persuading
even it how to find it all out. We are, indeed, more inclined to seek how best to reply to such
arguments as oppose our error, than to experience how salutary would be our condition if
we were free from error. We ought, therefore, to encounter all such, not by discussions, but
rather by prayers both for them and for ourselves. For we never say to them, what this opponent
has opposed to himself, that “sin was necessary in order that there might be a cause
for God’s mercy.” Would there had never been misery to render that mercy necessary! But
the iniquity of sin,—which is so much the greater in proportion to the ease wherewith man
might have avoided sin, whilst no infirmity did as yet beset him,—has been followed closely
up by a most righteous punishment; even that [offending man] should receive in himself a
reward in kind of his sin, losing that obedience of his body which had been in some degree
put under his own control, which he had despised when it was the right of his Lord. And,
inasmuch as we are now born with the self-same law of sin, which in our members resists
the law of our mind, we ought never to murmur against God, nor to dispute in opposition
to the clearest fact, but to seek and pray for His mercy instead of our punishment.</p>

Any Good Work Whatever. God Never Forsakes the Justified Man If He Be Not
Himself Forsaken.1203</head>
<p>Observe, indeed, how cautiously he expresses himself: “God, no doubt, applies His
mercy even to this office, whenever it is necessary because man after sin requires help in
this way, not because God wished there should be a cause for such necessity.” Do you not
see how he does not say that God’s grace is necessary to prevent us from sinning, but because
we have sinned? Then he adds: “But just in the same way it is the duty of a physician to be
ready to cure a man who is already wounded; although he ought not to wish for a man who
is sound to be wounded.” Now, if this simile suits the subject of which we are treating, human
nature is certainly incapable of receiving a wound from sin, inasmuch as sin is not a substance.
As therefore, for example’s sake, a man who is lamed by a wound is cured in order
that his step for the future may be direct and strong, its past infirmity being healed, so does
the Heavenly Physician cure our maladies, not only that they may cease any longer to exist,
but in order that we may ever afterwards be able to walk aright,—to which we should be
unequal, even after our healing, except by His continued help. For after a medical man has
administered a cure, in order that the patient may be afterwards duly nourished with bodily
elements and ailments, for the completion and continuance of the said cure by suitable
means and help, he commends him to God’s good care, who bestows these aids on all who
live in the flesh, and from whom proceeded even those means which [the physician] applied
during the process of the cure. For it is not out of any resources which he has himself created
that the medical man effects any cure, but out of the resources of Him who creates all things
which are required by the whole and by the sick. God, however, whenever He—through
“the one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus”—spiritually heals the sick
or raises the dead, that is, justifies the ungodly, and when He has brought him to perfect
health, in other words, to the fulness of life and righteousness, does not forsake, if He is not
forsaken, in order that life may be passed in constant piety and righteousness. For, just as
the eye of the body, even when completely sound, is unable to see unless aided by the
brightness of light, so also man, even when most fully justified, is unable to lead a holy life,
if he be not divinely assisted by the eternal light of righteousness. God, therefore, heals us
not only that He may blot out the sin which we have committed, but, furthermore, that He
may enable us even to avoid sinning.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—The Order and Process of Healing Our Heavenly Physician Does Not
Adopt from the Sick Patient, But Derives from Himself. What Cause the Righteous
Have for Fearing.</head>
<p>“But God,” they say, “is able to heal all things.” Of course His purpose in acting is to
heal all things; but He acts on His own judgment, and does not take His procedure in healing
from the sick man. For undoubtedly it was His wish to endow His apostle with very great
power and strength, and yet He said to him: “My strength is made perfect in weakness;”1204
nor did He remove from him, though he so often entreated Him to do so, that mysterious
“thorn in the flesh,” which He told him had been given to him “lest he should be unduly
exalted through the abundance of the revelation.”1205 For all other sins only prevail in evil
deeds; pride only has to be guarded against in things that are rightly done. Whence it happens
that those persons are admonished not to attribute to their own power the gifts of God, nor
to plume themselves thereon, lest by so doing they should perish with a heavier perdition
than if they had done no good at all, to whom it is said: “Work out your own salvation with
fear and trembling, for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good
pleasure.”1206 Why, then, must it be with fear and trembling, and not rather with security,
since God is working; except it be because there so quickly steals over our human soul, by
reason of our will (without which we can do nothing well), the inclination to esteem simply
as our own accomplishment whatever good we do; and so each one of us says in his
prosperity: “I shall never be moved?”1207 Therefore, He who in His good pleasure had added
strength to our beauty, turns away His face, and the man who had made his boast becomes
troubled, because it is by actual sorrows that the swelling pride must be remedied.</p>

<head>Chapter 32 <del>XXVIII.</del>—God Forsakes Us to Some Extent that We May Not Grow
Proud.</head>
<p>Therefore it is not said to a man: “It necessary for you to sin that you may not sin;” but
it is said to a man: “God in some degree forsakes you, in consequence of which you grow
proud, that you may know that you are ‘not your own,’ but are His,1208 and learn not to be
proud.” Now even that incident in the apostle’s life, of this kind, is so wonderful, that were
it not for the fact that he himself is the voucher for it whose truth it is impious to contradict,
would it not be incredible? For what believer is there who is ignorant that the first incentive
to sin came from Satan, and that he is the first author of all sins? And yet, for all that, some
are “delivered over unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.” 1209 How comes it
to pass, then, that Satan’s work is prevented by the work of Satan? These and such like
questions let a man regard in such a light that they seem not to him to be too acute; they
have somewhat of the sound of acuteness, and yet when discussed are found to be obtuse.
What must we say also to our author’s use of similes whereby he rather suggests to us the
answer which we should give to him? “What” (asks he) “shall I say more than this, that we
may believe that fires are quenched by fires, if we may believe that sins are cured by sins?”
What if one cannot put out fires by fires: but yet pains can, for all that, as I have shown, be
cured by pains? Poisons can also, if one only inquire and learn the fact, be expelled by
poisons. Now, if he observes that the heats of fevers are sometimes subdued by certain
medicinal warmths, he will perhaps also allow that fires may be extinguished by fires.</p>

<head>Chapter 33 <del>XXIX.</del>—Not Every Sin is Pride. How Pride is the Commencement of
Every Sin.</head>
<p>“But how,” asks he, “shall we separate pride itself from sin?” Now, why does he raise
such a question, when it is manifest that even pride itself is a sin? “To sin,” says he, “is quite
as much to be proud, as to be proud is to sin; for only ask what every sin is, and see whether
you can find any sin without the designation of pride.” Then he thus pursues this opinion,
and endeavours to prove it thus: “Every sin,” says he, “if I mistake not, is a contempt of God,
and every contempt of God is pride. For what is so proud as to despise God? All sin, then,
is also pride, even as Scripture says, Pride is the beginning of all sin.”1210 Let him seek diligently,
and he will find in the law that the sin of pride is quite distinguished from all other
sins. For many sins are committed through pride; but yet not all things which are wrongly
done are done proudly,—at any rate, not by the ignorant, not by the infirm, and not, generally
speaking, by the weeping and sorrowful. And indeed pride, although it be in itself a great
sin, is of such sort in itself alone apart from others, that, as I have already remarked, it for
the most part follows after and steals with more rapid foot, not so much upon sins as upon
things which are actually well done. However, that which he has understood in another
sense, is after all most truly said: “Pride is the commencement of all sin;” because it was this
which overthrew the devil, from whom arose the origin of sin; and afterwards, when his
malice and envy pursued man, who was yet standing in his uprightness, it subverted him
in the same way in which he himself fell. For the serpent, in fact, only sought for the door
of pride whereby to enter when he said, “Ye shall be as gods.”1211 Truly then is it said, “Pride
is the commencement of all sin;”1212 and, “The beginning of pride is when a man departeth
from God.”1213</p>

not, if it is necessary. Or, if it is his own, it is voluntary: and if it is voluntary, it can be
avoided.” We reply: It is unquestionably his own. But the fault by which sin is committed
is not yet in every respect healed, and the fact of its becoming permanently fixed in us arises
from our not rightly using the healing virtue; and so out of this faulty condition the man
who is now growing strong in depravity commits many sins, either through infirmity or
blindness. Prayer must therefore be made for him, that he may be healed, and that he may
thenceforward attain to a life of uninterrupted soundness of health; nor must pride be indulged
in, as if any man were healed by the self-same power whereby he became corrupted.</p>

<head>Chapter 35 <del>XXXI.</del>—Why God Does Not Immediately Cure Pride Itself. The Secret
and Insidious Growth of Pride. Preventing and Subsequent Grace.</head>
<p>But I would indeed so treat these topics, as to confess myself ignorant of God’s deeper
counsel, why He does not at once heal the very principle of pride, which lies in wait for
man’s heart even in deeds rightly done; and for the cure of which pious souls, with tears
and strong crying, beseech Him that He would stretch forth His right hand and help their
endeavours to overcome it, and somehow tread and crush it under foot. Now when a man
has felt glad that he has even by some good work overcome pride, from the very joy he lifts
up his head and says: “Behold, I live; why do you triumph? Nay, I live because you triumph.”
Premature, however, this forwardness of his to triumph over pride may perhaps be, as if it
were now vanquished, whereas its last shadow is to be swallowed up, as I suppose, in that
noontide which is promised in the scripture which says, “He shall bring forth thy righteousness
as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday;” 1214 provided that be done which was
written in the preceding verse: “Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him, and He
shall bring it to pass,”1215—not, as some suppose, that they themselves bring it to pass. Now,
when he said, “And He shall bring it to pass,” he evidently had none other in mind but those
who say, We ourselves bring it to pass; that is to say, we ourselves justify our own selves. In
this matter, no doubt, we do ourselves, too, work; but we are fellow-workers with Him who
does the work, because His mercy anticipates us. He anticipates us, however, that we may
be healed; but then He will also follow us, that being healed we may grow healthy and strong.
He anticipates us that we may be called; He will follow us that we may be glorified. He anticipates
us that we may lead godly lives; He will follow us that we may always live with Him,
because without Him we can do nothing.1216 Now the Scriptures refer to both these operations
of grace. There is both this: “The God of my mercy shall anticipate me,”1217 and again
this: “Thy mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.”1218 Let us therefore unveil to Him
our life by confession, not praise it with a vindication. For if it is not His way, but our own,
beyond doubt it is not the right one. Let us therefore reveal this by making our confession
to Him; for however much we may endeavour to conceal it, it is not hid from Him. It is a
good thing to confess unto the Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter 36 <del>XXXII.</del>—Pride Even in Such Things as are Done Aright Must Be
Avoided. Free Will is Not Taken Away When Grace is Preached.</head>
<p>So will He bestow on us whatever pleases Him, that if there be anything displeasing to
Him in us, it will also be displeasing to us. “He will,” as the Scripture has said, “turn aside
our paths from His own way,”1219 and will make that which is His own to be our way; because
it is by Himself that the favour is bestowed on such as believe in Him and hope in Him that
we will do it. For there is a way of righteousness of which they are ignorant “who have a zeal
for God, but not according to knowledge,”1220 and who, wishing to frame a righteousness
of their own, “have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.”1221 “For Christ
is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth;”1222 and He has said, “I
am the way.”1223 Yet God’s voice has alarmed those who have already begun to walk in this
way, lest they should be lifted up, as if it were by their own energies that they were walking
therein. For the same persons to whom the apostle, on account of this danger, says, “Work
out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to
will and to do of His good pleasure,”1224 are likewise for the self-same reason admonished
in the psalm: “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling. Accept correction,
lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the righteous way, when His wrath
shall be suddenly kindled upon you.”1225 He does not say, “Lest at any time the Lord be
angry and refuse to show you the righteous way,” or, “refuse to lead you into the way of
righteousness;” but even after you are walking therein, he was able so to terrify as to say,
“Lest ye perish from the righteous way.” Now, whence could this arise if not from pride,
which (as I have so often said, and must repeat again and again) has to be guarded against
even in things which are rightly done, that is, in the very way of righteousness, lest a man,
by regarding as his own that which is really God’s, lose what is God’s and be reduced merely
to what is his own? Let us then carry out the concluding injunction of this same psalm,
“Blessed are all they that trust in Him,”1226 so that He may Himself indeed effect and
Himself show His own way in us, to whom it is said, “Show us Thy mercy, O Lord;”1227 and

is offered, “And grant us Thy salvation;”1228 and Himself lead us in the self-same way, to

whom are those gracious gifts of use, but to the man who uses, but humbly uses, his own
will, and makes no boast of the power and energy thereof, as if it alone were sufficient for

Praise of Humility Must Not Be Placed to the Account of Falsehood.</head>
<p>I am favourably disposed, indeed, to the view of our author, when he resists those who
say to him, “What you assert seems indeed to be reasonable, but it is an arrogant thing to
allege that any man can be without sin,” with this answer, that if it is at all true, it must not
on any account be called an arrogant statement; for with very great truth and acuteness he
asks, “On what side must humility be placed? No doubt on the side of falsehood, if you
prove arrogance to exist on the side of truth.” And so he decides, and rightly decides, that
humility should rather be ranged on the side of truth, not of falsehood. Whence it follows
that he who said, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
in us,”1232 must without hesitation be held to have spoken the truth, and not be thought to
have spoken falsehood for the sake of humility. Therefore he added the words, “And the
truth is not in us;” whereas it might perhaps have been enough if he merely said, “We deceive
ourselves,” if he had not observed that some were capable of supposing that the clause “we
deceive ourselves” is here employed on the ground that the man who praises himself is even
extolled for a really good action. So that, by the addition of “the truth is not in us,” he clearly
shows (even as our author most correctly observes) that it is not at all true if we say that we
have no sin, lest humility, if placed on the side of falsehood, should lose the reward of truth.</p>

<p>Beyond this, however, although he flatters himself that he vindicates the cause of God

the Physician’s mercy. He, however, who created him is also his Saviour. We ought not,
therefore, so to magnify the Creator as to be compelled to say, nay, rather as to be convicted
of saying, that the Saviour is superfluous. Man’s nature indeed we may honour with worthy
praise, and attribute the praise to the Creator’s glory; but at the same time, while we show
our gratitude to Him for having created us, let us not be ungrateful to Him for healing us.
Our sins which He heals we must undoubtedly attribute not to God’s operation, but to the
wilfulness of man, and submit them to His righteous punishment; as, however, we acknowledge
that it was in our power that they should not be committed, so let us confess that it
lies in His mercy rather than in our own power that they should be healed. But this mercy
and remedial help of the Saviour, according to this writer, consists only in this, that He
forgives the transgressions that are past, not that He helps us to avoid such as are to come.
Here he is most fatally mistaken; here, however unwittingly—here he hinders us from being
watchful, and from praying that “we enter not into temptation,” since he maintains that it

<p>He who has a sound judgment says soundly, “that the examples of certain persons, of
whose sinning we read in Scripture, are not recorded for this purpose, that they may encourage
despair of not sinning, and seem somehow to afford security in committing sin,”—but
that we may learn the humility of repentance, or else discover that even in such falls salvation
ought not to be despaired of. For there are some who, when they have fallen into sin, perish
rather from the recklessness of despair, and not only neglect the remedy of repentance, but
become the slaves of lusts and wicked desires, so far as to run all lengths in gratifying these
depraved and abandoned dispositions,—as if it were a loss to them if they failed to accomplish
what their lust impelled them to, whereas all the while there awaits them a certain condemnation.
To oppose this morbid recklessness, which is only too full of danger and ruin, there
is great force in the record of those sins into which even just and holy men have before now
fallen.</p>

suppose that those holy men quitted this life,—with sin, or without sin?” For if we answer,
“With sin,” condemnation will be supposed to have been their destiny, which it is shocking
to imagine; but if it be said that they departed this life “without sin,” then it would be a proof
that man had been without sin in his present life, at all events, when death was approaching.
But, with all his acuteness, he overlooks the circumstance that even righteous persons not
without good reason offer up this prayer: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;”
1233 and that the Lord Christ, after explaining the prayer in His teaching, most truly
added: “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Father will also forgive you your trespasses.”
1234 Here, indeed, we have the daily incense, so to speak, of the Spirit, which is
offered to God on the altar of the heart, which we are bidden “to lift up,”—implying that,
even if we cannot live here without sin, we may yet die without sin, when in merciful forgiveness
the sin is blotted out which is committed in ignorance or infirmity.</p>

He then enumerates those “who not only lived without sin, but are described as having
led holy lives,—Abel, Enoch, Melchizedek, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joshua the son of Nun,
Phinehas, Samuel, Nathan, Elijah, Joseph, Elisha, Micaiah, Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah,
Mishael, Mordecai, Simeon, Joseph to whom the Virgin Mary was espoused, John.” And
he adds the names of some women,—“Deborah, Anna the mother of Samuel, Judith, Esther,
the other Anna, daughter of Phanuel, Elisabeth, and also the mother of our Lord and Saviour,
for of her,” he says, “we must needs allow that her piety had no sin in it.” We must except
the holy Virgin Mary, concerning whom I wish to raise no question when it touches the
subject of sins, out of honour to the Lord; for from Him we know what abundance of grace
for overcoming sin in every particular was conferred upon her who had the merit to conceive
and bear Him who undoubtedly had no sin.1235 Well, then, if, with this exception of the
Virgin, we could only assemble together all the forementioned holy men and women, and
ask them whether they lived without sin whilst they were in this life, what can we suppose
would be their answer? Would it be in the language of our author, or in the words of the
Apostle John? I put it to you, whether, on having such a question submitted to them, however
excellent might have been their sanctity in this body, they would not have exclaimed with
one voice: “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?”1236
But perhaps this their answer would have been more humble than true! Well, but our author
has already determined, and rightly determined, “not to place the praise of humility on the
side of falsehood.” If, therefore, they spoke the truth in giving such an answer, they would
have sin, and since they humbly acknowledged it, the truth would be in them; but if they
lied in their answer, they would still have sin, because the truth would not be in them.</p>

I perceive that he was unwilling to be silent. What he has said, I beg of you to observe: “This,”
says he, “might be rightly asked of those whom Scripture mentions neither as good nor as
bad; but of those whose holiness it commemorates, it would also without doubt have commemorated
the sins likewise, if it had perceived that they had sinned in anything.” Let him
say, then, that their great faith did not attain to righteousness in the case of those who
comprised “the multitudes that went before and that followed” the colt on which the Lord
rode, when “they shouted and said, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh
in the name of the Lord,”1237 even amidst the malignant men who with murmurs asked
why they were doing all this! Let him then boldly tell us, if he can, that there was not a man
in all that vast crowd who had any sin at all. Now, if it is most absurd to make such a statement

in the very beginning of the world, when there were only four persons in existence, what
reason (asks he) have we to give why it chose not to mention the sins of all? Was it in consideration
of the vast multitude, which had not yet come into existence? or because, having
mentioned only the sins of those who had transgressed, it was unable to record any of him
who had not yet committed sin?” And then he proceeds to add some words, in which he
unfolds this idea with a fuller and more explicit illustration. “It is certain,” says he, “that in
the earliest age Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel their sons, are mentioned as being the
only four persons then in being. Eve sinned,—the Scripture distinctly says so much; Adam
also transgressed, as the same Scripture does not fail to inform us; whilst it affords us an
equally clear testimony that Cain also sinned: and of all these it not only mentions the sins,
but also indicates the character of their sins. Now if Abel had likewise sinned, Scripture
would without doubt have said so. But it has not said so, therefore he committed no sin;
nay, it even shows him to have been righteous. What we read, therefore, let us believe; and
what we do not read, let us deem it wicked to add.”</p>

<p>When he says this, he forgets what he had himself said not long before: “After the human
race had multiplied, it was possible that in the crowd the Scripture may have neglected to
notice the sins of all men.” If indeed he had borne this well in mind, he would have seen
that even in one man there was such a crowd and so vast a number of slight sins, that it
would have been impossible (or, even if possible, not desirable) to describe them. For only
such are recorded as the due bounds allowed, and as would, by few examples, serve for instructing
the reader in the many cases where he needed warning. Scripture has indeed
omitted to mention concerning the few persons who were then in existence, either how
many or who they were,—in other words, how many sons and daughters Adam and Eve
begat, and what names they gave them; and from this circumstance some, not considering
how many things are quietly passed over in Scripture, have gone so far as to suppose that
Cain cohabited with his mother, and by her had the children which are mentioned, thinking
that Adam’s sons had no sisters, because Scripture failed to mention them in the particular

omitted,—that “Adam begat sons and daughters,”1238 without, however, dropping a syllable
to intimate either their number or the time when they were born. In like manner it was
unnecessary to state whether Abel, notwithstanding that he is rightly styled “righteous,”
ever indulged in immoderate laughter, or was ever jocose in moments of relaxation, or ever
looked at an object with a covetous eye, or ever plucked fruit to extravagance, or ever suffered
indigestion from too much eating, or ever in the midst of his prayers permitted his thoughts
to wander and call him away from the purpose of his devotion; as well as how frequently
these and many other similar failings stealthily crept over his mind. And are not these failings
sins, about which the apostle’s precept gives us a general admonition that we should avoid
and restrain them, when he says: “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
should obey it in the lusts thereof?”1239 To escape from such an obedience, we have to
struggle in a constant and daily conflict against unlawful and unseemly inclinations. Only
let the eye be directed, or rather abandoned, to an object which it ought to avoid, and let
the mischief strengthen and get the mastery, and adultery is consummated in the body,
which is committed in the heart only so much more quickly as thought is more rapid than
action and there is no impediment to retard and delay it. They who in a great degree have
curbed this sin, that is, this appetite of a corrupt affection, so as not to obey its desires, nor

to “yield their members to it as instruments of unrighteousness,”1240 have fairly deserved
to be called righteous persons, and this by the help of the grace of God. Since, however, sin
often stole over them in very small matters, and when they were off their guard, they were
both righteous, and at the same time not sinless. To conclude, if there was in righteous Abel
that love of God whereby alone he is truly righteous who is righteous, to enable him, and
to lay him under a moral obligation, to advance in holiness, still in whatever degree he fell
short therein was of sin. And who indeed can help thus falling short, until he come to that
mighty power thereof, in which man’s entire infirmity shall be swallowed up?</p>

<p>It is, to be sure, a grand sentence with which he concluded this passage, when he says:
“What we read, therefore, let us believe; and what we do not read, let us deem it wicked to

we ought not to believe even everything that we read, on the sanction of the apostle’s advice:
“Read all things; hold fast that which is good.”1241 Nor is it wicked to add something which
we have not read; for it is in our power to add something which we have bona fideexperienced

<p>Perhaps, however, he thinks the name of Christ to be necessary on this account, that by
His gospel we may learn how we ought to live; but not that we may be also assisted by His
grace, in order withal to lead good lives. Well, even this consideration should lead him at
least to confess that there is a miserable darkness in the human mind, which knows how it
ought to tame a lion, but knows not how to live. To know this, too, is it enough for us to
have free will and natural law? This is that wisdom of word, whereby “the cross of Christ is
rendered of none effect.”1244 He, however, who said, “I will destroy the wisdom of the
wise,”1245 since that cross cannot be made of none effect, in very deed overthrows that
wisdom by the foolishness of preaching whereby believers are healed. For if natural capacity,
by help of free will, is in itself sufficient both for discovering how one ought to live, and also
for leading a holy life, then “Christ died in vain,”1246 and therefore also “the offence of the
cross is ceased.”1247 Why also may I not myself exclaim?—nay, I will exclaim, and chide
them with a Christian’s sorrow,—“Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you
are justified by nature; ye are fallen from grace;”1248 for, “being ignorant of God’s righteousness,
and wishing to establish your own righteousness, you have not submitted yourselves
to the righteousness of God.”1249 For even as “Christ is the end of the law,” so likewise is
He the Saviour of man’s corrupted nature, “for righteousness to every one that believeth.”1250</p>

<head>Chapter 48 <del>XLI.</del>—How the Term “All” Is to Be Understood.</head>
<p>His opponents adduced the passage, “All have sinned,”1251 and he met their statement
founded on this with the remark that “the apostle was manifestly speaking of the then existing
generation, that is, the Jews and the Gentiles;” but surely the passage which I have quoted,
“By one man sin entered the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men; in
which all have sinned,”1252 embraces in its terms the generations both of old and of modern
times, both ourselves and our posterity. He adduces also this passage, whence he would
prove that we ought not to understand all without exception, when “all” is used:—“As by
the offence of one,” he says, “upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness
of One, upon all men unto justification of life.”1253 “There can be no doubt,” he says, “that
not all men are sanctified by the righteousness of Christ, but only those who are willing to
obey Him, and have been cleansed in the washing of His baptism.” Well, but he does not
prove what he wants by this quotation. For as the clause, “By the offence of one, upon all
men to condemnation,” is so worded that not one is omitted in its sense, so in the corresponding
clause, “By the righteousness of One, upon all men unto justification of life,” no
one is omitted in its sense,—not, indeed, because all men have faith and are washed in His
baptism, but because no man is justified unless he believes in Christ and is cleansed by His
baptism. The term “all” is therefore used in a way which shows that no one whatever can
be supposed able to be saved by any other means than through Christ Himself. For if in a
city there be appointed but one instructor, we are most correct in saying: That man teaches
all in that place; not meaning, indeed, that all who live in the city take lessons of him, but
that no one is instructed unless taught by him. In like manner no one is justified unless
Christ has justified him.1254</p>

<head>Chapter 49 <del>XLII.</del>—A Man Can Be Sinless, But Only by the Help of Grace. In the
Saints This Possibility Advances and Keeps Pace with the Realization.</head>
<p>“Well, be it so,” says he, “I agree; he testifies to the fact that all were sinners. He says,
indeed, what they have been, not that they might not have been something else. Wherefore,”
he adds, “if all then could be proved to be sinners, it would not by any means prejudice our
own definite position, in insisting not so much on what men are, as on what they are able
to be.” He is right for once to allow that no man living is justified in God’s sight. He contends,
however, that this is not the question, but that the point lies in the possibility of a man’s not
sinning,—on which subject it is unnecessary for us to take ground against him; for, in truth,
I do not much care about expressing a definite opinion on the question, whether in the
present life there ever have been, or now are, or ever can be, any persons who have had, or
are having, or are to have, the love of God so perfectly as to admit of no addition to it (for
nothing short of this amounts to a most true, full, and perfect righteousness). For I ought
not too sharply to contend as to when, or where, or in whom is done that which I confess
and maintain can be done by the will of man, aided by the grace of God. Nor do I indeed
contend about the actual possibility, forasmuch as the possibility under dispute advances
with the realization in the saints, their human will being healed and helped; whilst “the love
of God,” as fully as our healed and cleansed nature can possibly receive it, “is shed abroad
in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us.”1255 In a better way, therefore, is God’s
cause promoted (and it is to its promotion that our author professes to apply his warm defence
of nature) when He is acknowledged as our Saviour no less than as our Creator, than
when His succour to us as Saviour is impaired and dwarfed to nothing by the defence of the
creature, as if it were sound and its resources entire.</p>

<p>What he says, however, is true enough, “that God is as good as just, and made man such
that he was quite able to live without the evil of sin, if only he had been willing.” For who
does not know that man was made whole and faultless, and endowed with a free will and a
free ability to lead a holy life? Our present inquiry, however, is about the man whom “the
thieves”1256 left half dead on the road, and who, being disabled and pierced through with
heavy wounds, is not so able to mount up to the heights of righteousness as he was able to
descend therefrom; who, moreover, if he is now in “the inn,”1257 is in process of cure. God
therefore does not command impossibilities; but in His command He counsels you both to
do what you can for yourself, and to ask His aid in what you cannot do. Now, we should
see whence comes the possibility, and whence the impossibility. This man says: “That proceeds
not from a man’s will which he can do by nature.” I say: A man is not righteous by
his will if he can be by nature. He will, however, be able to accomplish by remedial aid what
he is rendered incapable of doing by his flaw.</p>

is to say, faith “in the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,”1259—faith
in His blood, faith in His cross, faith in His death and resurrection. As we therefore have
the same spirit of faith, we also believe, and on that account also speak.</p>

<p>Let us, however, observe what our author answers, after laying before himself the
question wherein he seems indeed so intolerable to Christian hearts. He says: “But you will
tell me this is what disturbs a great many,—that you do not maintain that it is by the grace
of God that a man is able to be without sin.” Certainly this is what causes us disturbance;
this is what we object to him. He touches the very point of the case. This is what causes us
such utter pain to endure it; this is why we cannot bear to have such points debated by
Christians, owing to the love which we feel towards others and towards themselves. Well,
let us hear how he clears himself from the objectionable character of the question he has
raised. “What blindness of ignorance,” he exclaims, “what sluggishness of an uninstructed
mind, which supposes that that is maintained and held to be without God’s grace which it
only hears ought to be attributed to God!” Now, if we knew nothing of what follows this
outburst of his, and formed our opinion on simply hearing these words, we might suppose
that we had been led to a wrong view of our opponents by the spread of report and by the
asseveration of some suitable witnesses among the brethren. For how could it have been
more pointedly and truly stated that the possibility of not sinning, to whatever extent it exists
or shall exist in man, ought only to be attributed to God? This too is our own affirmation.

<head>Chapter 53 <del>XLV.</del>—Pelagius Distinguishes Between a Power and Its Use.</head>
<p>Well, are there other things to listen to? Yes, certainly; both to listen to, and correct and
guard against. “Now, when it is said,” he says, “that the very ability is not at all of man’s will,
but of the Author of nature,—that is, God,—how can that possibly be understood to be
without the grace of God which is deemed especially to belong to God?” Already we begin
to see what he means; but that we may not lie under any mistake, he explains himself with
greater breadth and clearness: “That this may become still plainer, we must,” says he, “enter
on a somewhat fuller discussion of the point. Now we affirm that the possibility of anything
lies not so much in the ability of a man’s will as in the necessity of nature.” He then proceeds
to illustrate his meaning by examples and similes. “Take,” says he, “for instance, my ability
to speak. That I am able to speak is not my own; but that I do speak is my own,—that is, of
my own will. And because the act of my speaking is my own, I have the power of alternative
action,—that is to say, both to speak and to refrain from speaking. But because my ability
to speak is not my own, that is, is not of my own determination and will, it is of necessity1260
that I am always able to speak; and though I wished not to be able to speak, I am unable,
nevertheless, to be unable to speak, unless perhaps I were to deprive myself of that member
whereby the function of speaking is to be performed.” Many means, indeed, might be
mentioned whereby, if he wish it, a man may deprive himself of the possibility of speaking,
without removing the organ of speech. If, for instance, anything were to happen to a man
to destroy his voice, he would be unable to speak, although the members remained; for a
man’s voice is of course no member. There may, in short, be an injury done to the member
internally, short of the actual loss of it. I am, however, unwilling to press the argument for
a word; and it may be replied to me in the contest, Why, even to injure is to lose. But yet we
can so contrive matters, by closing and shutting the mouth with bandages, as to be quite
incapable of opening it, and to put the opening of it out of our power, although it was quite
in our own power to shut it while the strength and healthy exercise of the limbs remained.</p>

“Whatever,” says he, “is fettered by natural necessity is deprived of determination of will
and deliberation.” Well, now, here lies a question; for it is the height of absurdity for us to
say that it does not belong to our will that we wish to be happy, on the ground that it is absolutely
impossible for us to be unwilling to be happy, by reason of some indescribable but
amiable coercion of our nature; nor dare we maintain that God has not the will but the necessity
of righteousness, because He cannot will to sin.</p>

<p>Mark also what follows. “We may perceive,” says he, “the same thing to be true of
hearing, smelling, and seeing,—that to hear, and to smell, and to see is of our own power,
while the ability to hear, and to smell, and to see is not of our own power, but lies in a natural
necessity.” Either I do not understand what he means, or he does not himself. For how
is the possibility of seeing not in our own power, if the necessity of not seeing is in our own
power because blindness is in our own power, by which we can deprive ourselves, if we will,
of this very ability to see? How, moreover, is it in our own power to see whenever we will,
when, without any loss whatever to our natural structure of body in the organ of sight, we
are unable, even though we wish, to see,—either by the removal of all external lights during
the night, or by our being shut up in some dark place? Likewise, if our ability or our inability
to hear is not in our own power, but lies in the necessity of nature, whereas our actual
hearing or not hearing is of our own will, how comes it that he is inattentive to the fact that
there are so many things which we hear against our will, which penetrate our sense even
when our ears are stopped, as the creaking of a saw near to us, or the grunt of a pig? Although
the said stopping of our ears shows plainly enough that it does not lie within our own power
not to hear so long as our ears are open; perhaps, too, such a stopping of our ears as shall
deprive us of the entire sense in question proves that even the ability not to hear lies within
our own power. As to his remarks, again, concerning our sense of smell, does he not display
no little carelessness when he says “that it is not in our own power to be able or to be unable
to smell, but that it is in our own power”—that is to say, in our free will—“to smell or not
to smell?” For let us suppose some one to place us, with our hands firmly tied, but yet without
any injury to our olfactory members, among some bad and noxious smells; in such a case
we altogether lose the power, however strong may be our wish, not to smell, because every
time we are obliged to draw breath we also inhale the smell which we do not wish.</p>

<p>Not only, then, are these similes employed by our author false, but so is the matter which
he wishes them to illustrate. He goes on to say: “In like manner, touching the possibility of
our not sinning, we must understand that it is of us not to sin, but yet that the ability to
avoid sin is not of us.” If he were speaking of man’s whole and perfect nature, which we do
not now possess (“for we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope. But if we hope
for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it”1261), his language even in that case
would not be correct to the effect that to avoid sinning would be of us alone, although to
sin would be of us, for even then there must be the help of God, which must shed itself on
those who are willing to receive it, just as the light is given to strong and healthy eyes to assist
them in their function of sight. Inasmuch, however, as it is about this present life of ours
that he raises the question, wherein our corruptible body weighs down the soul, and our
earthly tabernacle depresses our sense with all its many thoughts, I am astonished that he
can with any heart suppose that, even without the help of our Saviour’s healing balm, it is
in our own power to avoid sin, and the ability not to sin is of nature, which gives only
stronger evidence of its own corruption by the very fact of its failing to see its taint.</p>

then, if another should say: “Inasmuch as not to wish for unhappiness is ours, we are able
both to wish for it and not to wish for it?” And yet we are positively unable to wish for it.
For who could possibly wish to be unhappy, even though he wishes for something else from
which unhappiness will ensue to him against his will? Then again, inasmuch as, in an infinitely
greater degree, it is God’s not to sin, shall we therefore venture to say that He is able
both to sin and to avoid sin? God forbid that we should ever say that He is able to sin! For
He cannot, as foolish persons suppose, therefore fail to be almighty, because He is unable
to die, or because He cannot deny Himself. What, therefore, does he mean? by what method
of speech does he try to persuade us on a point which he is himself loth to consider? For he
advances a step further, and says: “Inasmuch as, however, it is not of us to be able to avoid
sin; even if we were to wish not to be able to avoid sin, it is not in our power to be unable
to avoid sin.” It is an involved sentence, and therefore a very obscure one. It might, however,
be more plainly expressed in some such way as this: “Inasmuch as to be able to avoid sin is
not of us, then, whether we wish it or do not wish it, we are able to avoid sin!” He does not
say, “Whether we wish it or do not wish it, we do not sin,”—for we undoubtedly do sin, if
we wish;—but yet he asserts that, whether we will or not, we have the capacity of not sin-
ning,—a capacity which he declares to be inherent in our nature. Of a man, indeed, who
has his legs strong and sound, it may be said admissibly enough, “whether he will or not he
has the capacity of walking;” but if his legs be broken, however much he may wish, he has
not the capacity. The nature of which our author speaks is corrupted. “Why is dust and
ashes proud?” 1262 It is corrupted. It implores the Physician’s help. “Save me, O Lord,”1263
is its cry; “Heal my soul,”1264 it exclaims. Why does he check such cries so as to hinder future
health, by insisting, as it were, on its present capacity?</p>

<p>Observe also what remark he adds, by which he thinks that his position is confirmed:
“No will,” says he, “can take away that which is proved to be inseparably implanted in
nature.” Whence then comes that utterance: “So then ye cannot do the things that ye
would?”1265 Whence also this: “For what good I would, that I do not; but what evil I hate,
that do I?”1266 Where is that capacity which is proved to be inseparably implanted in nature?
See, it is human beings who do not what they will; and it is about not sinning, certainly, that
he was treating,—not about not flying, because it was men not birds, that formed his subject.
Behold, it is man who does not the good which he would, but does the evil which he would
not: “to will is present with him, but how to perform that which is good is not present.”1267
Where is the capacity which is proved to be inseparably implanted in nature? For whomsoever
the apostle represents by himself, if he does not speak these things of his own self, he certainly
represents a man by himself. By our author, however, it is maintained that our human nature
actually possesses an inseparable capacity of not at all sinning. Such a statement, however,
even when made by a man who knows not the effect of his words (but this ignorance is
hardly attributable to the man who suggests these statements for unwary though God-fearing
men), causes the grace of Christ to be “made of none effect,”1268 since it is pretended that
human nature is sufficient for its own holiness and justification.</p>

of Not Sinning.</head>
<p>In order, however, to escape from the odium wherewith Christians guard their salvation,
he parries their question when they ask him, “Why do you affirm that man without the help
of God’s grace is able to avoid sin?” by saying, “The actual capacity of not sinning lies not
so much in the power of will as in the necessity of nature. Whatever is placed in the necessity
of nature undoubtedly appertains to the Author of nature, that is, God. How then,” says he,
“can that be regarded as spoken without the grace of God which is shown to belong in an
especial manner to God?” Here the opinion is expressed which all along was kept in the
background; there is, in fact, no way of permanently concealing such a doctrine. The reason
why he attributes to the grace of God the capacity of not sinning is, that God is the Author
of nature, in which, he declares, this capacity of avoiding sin is inseparably implanted.
Whenever He wills a thing, no doubt He does it; and what He wills not, that He does not.
Now, wherever there is this inseparable capacity, there cannot accrue any infirmity of the
will; or rather, there cannot be both a presence of will and a failure in “performance.”1269
This, then, being the case, how comes it to pass that “to will is present, but how to perform
that which is good” is not present? Now, if the author of the work we are discussing spoke
of that nature of man, which was in the beginning created faultless and perfect, in whatever
sense his dictum be taken, “that it has an inseparable capacity,”—that is, so to say, one which
cannot be lost,—then that nature ought not to have been mentioned at all which could be
corrupted, and which could require a physician to cure the eyes of the blind, and restore
that capacity of seeing which had been lost through blindness. For I suppose a blind man
would like to see, but is unable; but, whenever a man wishes to do a thing and cannot, there
is present to him the will, but he has lost the capacity.</p>

<head>Chapter 60 <del>LII.</del>—Pelagius Admits “Contrary Flesh” In the Unbaptized.</head>
<p>See what obstacles he still attempts to break through, if possible, in order to introduce
his own opinion. He raises a question for himself in these terms: “But you will tell me that,
according to the apostle, the flesh is contrary1270 to us;” and then answers it in this wise:
“How can it be that in the case of any baptized person the flesh is contrary to him, when
according to the same apostle he is understood not to be in the flesh? For he says, ‘But ye
are not in the flesh.’”1271 Very well; we shall soon see1272 whether it be really true that this
says that in the baptized the flesh cannot be contrary to them; at present, however, as it was
impossible for him quite to forget that he was a Christian (although his reminiscence on
the point is but slight), he has quitted his defence of nature. Where then is that inseparable
capacity of his? Are those who are not yet baptized not a part of human nature? Well, now,
here by all means, here at this point, he might find his opportunity of awaking out of his
sleep; and he still has it if he is careful. “How can it be,” he asks, “that in the case of a baptized
person the flesh is contrary to him?” Therefore to the unbaptized the flesh can be contrary!
Let him tell us how; for even in these there is that nature which has been so stoutly defended
by him. However, in these he does certainly allow that nature is corrupted, inasmuch as it
was only among the baptized that the wounded traveller left his inn sound and well, or
rather remains sound in the inn whither the compassionate Samaritan carried him that he
might become cured.1273 Well, now, if he allows that the flesh is contrary even in these, let
him tell us what has happened to occasion this, since the flesh and the spirit alike are the
work of one and the same Creator, and are therefore undoubtedly both of them good, because
He is good,—unless indeed it be that damage which has been inflicted by man’s own will.
And that this may be repaired in our nature, there is need of that very Saviour from whose
creative hand nature itself proceeded. Now, if we acknowledge that this Saviour, and that
healing remedy of His by which the Word was made flesh in order to dwell among us, are
required by small and great,—by the crying infant and the hoary-headed man alike,—then,
in fact, the whole controversy of the point between us is settled.</p>

<head>Chapter 61 <del>LIII.</del>—Paul Asserts that the Flesh is Contrary Even in the Baptized.</head>
<p>Now let us see whether we anywhere read about the flesh being contrary in the baptized
also. And here, I ask, to whom did the apostle say, “The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye do not the
things that ye would?”1274 He wrote this, I apprehend, to the Galatians, to whom he also
says, “He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you,
doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?”1275 It appears, therefore, that
it is to Christians that he speaks, to whom, too, God had given His Spirit: therefore, too, to
the baptized. Observe, therefore, that even in baptized persons the flesh is found to be contrary;
so that they have not that capacity which, our author says, is inseparably implanted
in nature. Where then is the ground for his assertion, “How can it be that in the case of a
baptized person the flesh is contrary to him?” in whatever sense he understands the flesh?
Because in very deed it is not its nature that is good, but it is the carnal defects of the flesh
which are expressly named in the passage before us.1276 Yet observe, even in the baptized,
how contrary is the flesh. And in what way contrary? So that, “They do not the things which
they would.” Take notice that the will is present in a man; but where is that “capacity of
nature?” Let us confess that grace is necessary to us; let us cry out, “O wretched man that I
am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” And let our answer be, “The grace
of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!”1277</p>

<head>Chapter 62.—Concerning What Grace of God is Here Under Discussion. The Ungodly
Man, When Dying, is Not Delivered from Concupiscence.</head>
<p>Now, whereas it is most correctly asked in those words put to him, “Why do you affirm
that man without the help of God’s grace is able to avoid sin?” yet the inquiry did not concern
that grace by which man was created, but only that whereby he is saved through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Faithful men say in their prayer, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil.”1278 But if they already have capacity, why do they pray? Or, what is the evil which
they pray to be delivered from, but, above all else, “the body of this death?” And from this
nothing but God’s grace alone delivers them, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not of course
from the substance of the body, which is good; but from its carnal offences, from which a
man is not liberated except by the grace of the Saviour,—not even when he quits the body
by the death of the body. If it was this that the apostle meant to declare, why had he previously
said, “I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing
me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members?”1279 Behold what damage the
disobedience of the will has inflicted on man’s nature! Let him be permitted to pray that he
may be healed! Why need he presume so much on the capacity of his nature? It is wounded,
hurt, damaged, destroyed. It is a true confession of its weakness, not a false defence of its
capacity, that it stands in need of. It requires the grace of God, not that it may be made, but
that it may be re-made. And this is the only grace which by our author is proclaimed to be
unnecessary; because of this he is silent! If, indeed, he had said nothing at all about God’s
grace, and had not proposed to himself that question for solution, for the purpose of removing
from himself the odium of this matter,1280 it might have been thought that his view of the
subject was consistent with the truth, only that he had refrained from mentioning it, on the
ground that not on all occasions need we say all we think. He proposed the question of
grace, and answered it in the way that he had in his heart; the question has been defined,—not
in the way we wished, but according to the doubt we entertained as to what was his meaning.</p>

<head>Chapter 63 <del>LIV.</del>—Does God Create Contraries?</head>
<p>He next endeavours, by much quotation from the apostle, about which there is no
controversy, to show “that the flesh is often mentioned by him in such a manner as proves
him to mean not the substance, but the works of the flesh.” What is this to the point? The
defects of the flesh are contrary to the will of man; his nature is not accused; but a Physician
is wanted for its defects. What signifies his question, “Who made man’s spirit?” and his own
answer thereto, “God, without a doubt?” Again he asks, “Who created the flesh?” and again
answers, “The same God, I suppose.” And yet a third question, “Is the God good who created
both?” and the third answer, “Nobody doubts it.” Once more a question, “Are not both
good, since the good Creator made them?” and its answer, “It must be confessed that they
are.” And then follows his conclusion: “If, therefore, both the spirit is good, and the flesh is
good, as made by the good Creator, how can it be that the two good things should be contrary
to one another?” I need not say that the whole of this reasoning would be upset if one were
to ask him, “Who made heat and cold?” and he were to say in answer, “God, without a
doubt.” I do not ask the string of questions. Let him determine himself whether these conditions
of climate may either be said to be not good, or else whether they do not seem to be
contrary to each other. Here he will probably object, “These are not substances, but the
qualities of substances.” Very true, it is so. But still they are natural qualities, and undoubtedly
belong to God’s creation; and substances, indeed, are not said to be contrary to each other
in themselves, but in their qualities, as water and fire. What if it be so too with flesh and
spirit? We do not affirm it to be so; but, in order to show that his argument terminates in a
conclusion which does not necessarily follow, we have said so much as this. For it is quite
possible for contraries not to be reciprocally opposed to each other, but rather by mutual
action to temper health and render it good; just as, in our body, dryness and moisture, cold
and heat,—in the tempering of which altogether consists our bodily health. The fact, however,
that “the flesh is contrary to the Spirit, so that we cannot do the things that we would,”1281
is a defect, not nature. The Physician’s grace must be sought, and their controversy must
end.</p>

<head>Chapter 64.—Pelagius’ Admission as Regards the Unbaptized, Fatal.</head>
<p>Now, as touching these two good substances which the good God created, how, against
the reasoning of this man, in the case of unbaptized persons, can they be contrary the one
to the other? Will he be sorry to have said this too, which he admitted out of some regard
to the Christians’ faith? For when he asked, “How, in the case of any person who is already
baptized, can it be that his flesh is contrary to him?” he intimated, of course, that in the case
of unbaptized persons it is possible for the flesh to be contrary. For why insert the clause,
“who is already baptized,” when without such an addition he might have put his question
thus: “How in the case of any person can the flesh be contrary?” and when, in order to prove
this, he might have subjoined that argument of his, that as both body and spirit are good
(made as they are by the good Creator), they therefore cannot be contrary to each other?
Now, suppose unbaptized persons (in whom, at any rate, he confesses that the flesh is contrary)
were to ply him with his own arguments, and say to him, Who made man’s spirit? he
must answer, God. Suppose they asked him again, Who created the flesh? and he answers,
The same God, I believe. Suppose their third question to be, Is the God good who created
both? and his reply to be, Nobody doubts it. Suppose once more they put to him his yet remaining
inquiry, Are not both good, since the good Creator made them? and he confesses
it. Then surely they will cut his throat with his own sword, when they force home his conclusion
on him, and say: Since therefore the spirit of man is good, and his flesh good, as
made by the good Creator, how can it be that the two being good should be contrary to one
another? Here, perhaps, he will reply: I beg your pardon, I ought not to have said that the
flesh cannot be contrary to the spirit in any baptized person, as if I meant to imply that it
is contrary in the unbaptized; but I ought to have made my statement general, to the effect
that the flesh in no man’s case is contrary. Now see into what a corner he drives himself.
See what a man will say, who is unwilling to cry out with the apostle, “Who shall deliver me
from the body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”1282 “But
why,” he asks, “should I so exclaim, who am already baptized in Christ? It is for them to cry
out thus who have not yet received so great a benefit, whose words the apostle in a figure
transferred to himself,—if indeed even they say so much.” Well, this defence of nature does
not permit even these to utter this exclamation! For in the baptized, there is no nature; and
in the unbaptized, nature is not! Or if even in the one class it is allowed to be corrupted, so
that it is not without reason that men exclaim, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
me from this body of death?” to the other, too, help is brought in what follows: “The grace
of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord;” then let it at last be granted that human nature
stands in need of Christ for its Physician.</p>

<head>Chapter 65 <del>LV.</del>—“This Body of Death,” So Called from Its Defect, Not from Its
Substance.</head>
<p>Now, I ask, when did our nature lose that liberty, which he craves to be given to him
when he says: “Who shall liberate me?”1283 For even he finds no fault with the substance of
the flesh when he expresses his desire to be liberated from the body of this death, since the
nature of the body, as well as of the soul, must be attributed to the good God as the author
thereof. But what he speaks of undoubtedly concerns the offences of the body. Now from
the body the death of the body separates us; whereas the offences contracted from the body
remain, and their just punishment awaits them, as the rich man found in hell.1284 From
these it was that he was unable to liberate himself, who said: “Who shall liberate me from
the body of this death?”1285 But whensoever it was that he lost this liberty, at least there remains
that “inseparable capacity” of nature,—he has the ability from natural resources,—he
has the volition from free will. Why does he seek the sacrament of baptism? Is it because of
past sins, in order that they may be forgiven, since they cannot be undone? Well, suppose
you acquit and release a man on these terms, he must still utter the old cry; for he not only
wants to be mercifully let off from punishment for past offences, but to be strengthened and
fortified against sinning for the time to come. For he “delights in the law of God, after the
inward man; but then he sees another law in his members, warring against the law of his
mind.”1286 Observe, he sees that there is, not recollects that there was. It is a present pressure,
not a past memory. And he sees the other law not only “warring,” but even “bringing him
into captivity to the law of sin, which is”(not which was) “in his members.”1287 Hence comes
that cry of his: “O wretched man that I am! who shall liberate me from the body of this
death?”1288 Let him pray, let him entreat for the help of the mighty Physician. Why gainsay
that prayer? Why cry down that entreaty? Why shall the unhappy suitor be hindered from
begging for the mercy of Christ,—and that too by Christians? For, it was even they who
were accompanying Christ that tried to prevent the blind man, by clamouring him down,
from begging for light; but even amidst the din and throng of the gainsayers He hears the
suppliant;1289 whence the response: “The grace of God, through Jesus Christ out Lord.”1290</p>

<p>Now if we secure even this concession from them, that unbaptized persons may implore
the assistance of the Saviour’s grace, this is indeed no slight point against that fallacious assertion
of the self-sufficiency of nature and of the power of free will. For he is not sufficient
to himself who says, “O wretched man that I am! who shall liberate me?” Nor can he be said
to have full liberty who still asks for liberation. [LVI.] But let us, moreover, see to this point
also, whether they who are baptized do the good which they would, without any resistance
from the lust of the flesh. That, however, which we have to say on this subject, our author
himself mentions, when concluding this topic he says: “As we remarked, the passage in
which occur the words, ‘The flesh lusteth against the Spirit,’1291 must needs have reference
not to the substance, but to the works of the flesh.” We too allege that this is spoken not of
the substance of the flesh, but of its works, which proceed from carnal concupiscence,—in
a word, from sin, concerning which we have this precept: “Not to let it reign in our mortal
body, that we should obey it in the lusts thereof.”1292</p>

<head>Chapter 67 <del>LVII.</del>—Who May Be Said to Be Under the Law.</head>
<p>But even our author should observe that it is to persons who have been already baptized
that it was said: “The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, so that
ye cannot do the things that ye would.”1293 And lest he should make them slothful for the
actual conflict, and should seem by this statement to have given them laxity in sinning, he
goes on to tell them: “If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are no longer under the law.”1294 For that
man is under the law, who, from fear of the punishment which the law threatens, and not
from any love for righteousness, obliges himself to abstain from the work of sin, without
being as yet free and removed from the desire of sinning. For it is in his very will that he is
guilty, whereby he would prefer, if it were possible, that what he dreads should not exist, in
order that he might freely do what he secretly desires. Therefore he says, “If ye be led of the
Spirit, ye are not under the law,”—even the law which inspires fear, but gives not love. For
this “love is shed abroad in our hearts,” not by the letter of the law, but “by the Holy Ghost
which is given unto us.”1295 This is the law of liberty, not of bondage; being the law of love,
not of fear; and concerning it the Apostle James says: “Whoso looketh into the perfect law
of liberty.”1296 Whence he, too, no longer indeed felt terrified by God’s law as a slave, but
delighted in it in the inward man, although still seeing another law in his members warring
against the law of his mind. Accordingly he here says: “If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not
under the law.” So far, indeed, as any man is led by the Spirit, he is not under the law; because,
so far as he rejoices in the law of God, he lives not in fear of the law, since “fear has torment,”</p>

<p>If, therefore, we feel rightly on this matter, it is our duty at once to be thankful for what
is already healed within us, and to pray for such further healing as shall enable us to enjoy
full liberty, in that most absolute state of health which is incapable of addition, the perfect
pleasure of God.1298 For we do not deny that human nature can be without sin; nor ought
we by any means to refuse to it the ability to become perfect, since we admit its capacity for
progress,—by God’s grace, however, through our Lord Jesus Christ. By His assistance we
aver that it becomes holy and happy, by whom it was created in order to be so. There is accordingly
an easy refutation of the objection which our author says is alleged by some against
him: “The devil opposes us.” This objection we also meet in entirely identical language with
that which he uses in reply: “We must resist him, and he will flee. ‘Resist the devil,’ says the
blessed apostle, ‘and he will flee from you.’1299 From which it may be observed, what his
harming amounts to against those whom he flees; or what power he is to be understood as
possessing, when he prevails only against those who do not resist him.” Such language is
my own also; for it is impossible to employ truer words. There is, however, this difference
between us and them, that we, whenever the devil has to be resisted, not only do not deny,
but actually teach, that God’s help must be sought; whereas they attribute so much power
to will as to take away prayer from religious duty. Now it is certainly with a view to resisting
the devil and his fleeing from us that we say when we pray, “Lead us not into temptation;”1300
to the same end also are we warned by our Captain, exhorting us as soldiers in the words:
“Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.”1301</p>

when we pray, for the avoidance of sin. If indeed he secretly allows this, he must forgive us
if we suspect otherwise. For he himself works this result, who, though encountering so much
obloquy on this subject, wishes to entertain the secret opinion, and yet is unwilling to confess
or profess it. It would surely be no great matter were he to speak out, especially since he has
undertaken to handle and open this point, as if it had been objected against him on the side
of opponents. Why on such occasions did he choose only to defend nature, and assert that
man was so created as to have it in his power not to sin if he wished not to sin; and, from
the fact that he was so created, definitely say that the power was owing to God’s grace which
enabled him to avoid sin, if he was unwilling to commit it; and yet refuse to say anything
concerning the fact that even nature itself is either, because disordered, healed by God’s
grace through our Lord Jesus Christ or else assisted by it, because in itself it is so insufficient?</p>

<p>Now, whether there ever has been, or is, or ever can be, a man living so righteous a life
in this world as to have no sin at all, may be an open question among true and pious
Christians;1302 but whoever doubts the possibility of this sinless state after this present life;
is foolish. For my own part, indeed, I am unwilling to dispute the point even as respects this
life. For although that passage seems to me to be incapable of bearing any doubtful sense,
wherein it is written, “In thy sight shall no man living be justified”1303 (and so of similar
passages), yet I could wish it were possible to show either that such quotations were capable
of bearing a better signification, or that a perfect and plenary righteousness, to which it were
impossible for any accession to be made, had been realized at some former time in some
one whilst passing through this life in the flesh, or was now being realized, or would be
hereafter. They, however, are in a great majority, who, while not doubting that to the last
day of their life it will be needful to them to resort to the prayer which they can so truthfully
utter, “Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,”1304 still trust
that in Christ and His promises they possess a true, certain, and unfailing hope. There is,
however, no method whereby any persons arrive at absolute perfection, or whereby any
man makes the slightest progress to true and godly righteousness, but the assisting grace of
our crucified Saviour Christ, and the gift of His Spirit; and whosoever shall deny this cannot
rightly, I almost think, be reckoned in the number of any kind of Christians at all.</p>

Advanced Out of the Catholic Writers. Lactantius.</head>
<p>Accordingly, with respect also to the passages which he has adduced,—not indeed from
the canonical Scriptures, but out of certain treatises of catholic writers,—I wish to meet the
assertions of such as say that the said quotations make for him. The fact is, these passages
are so entirely neutral, that they oppose neither our own opinion nor his. Amongst them
he wanted to class something out of my own books, thus accounting me to be a person who
seemed worthy of being ranked with them. For this I must not be ungrateful, and I should
be sorry—so I say with unaffected friendliness—for him to be in error, since he has conferred
this honour upon me. As for his first quotation, indeed, why need I examine it largely, since
I do not see here the author’s name, either because he has not given it, or because from some
casual mistake the copy which you1305 forwarded to me did not contain it? Especially as in
writings of such authors I feel myself free to use my own judgment (owing unhesitating assent
to nothing but the canonical Scriptures), whilst in fact there is not a passage which he has
quoted from the works of this anonymous author1306 that disturbs me. “It behooved,” says
he, “for the Master and Teacher of virtue to become most like to man, that by conquering
sin He might show that man is able to conquer sin.” Now, however this passage may be expressed,
its author must see to it as to what explanation it is capable of bearing. We, indeed,
on our part, could not possibly doubt that in Christ there was no sin to conquer,—born as
He was in the likeness of sinful flesh, not in sinful flesh itself. Another passage is adduced
from the same author to this effect: “And again, that by subduing the desires of the flesh He
might teach us that it is not of necessity that one sins, but of set purpose and will.”1307 For
my own part, I understand these desires of the flesh (if it is not of its unlawful lusts that the
writer here speaks) to be such as hunger, thirst, refreshment after fatigue, and the like. For
it is through these, however faultless they be in themselves, that some men fall into sin,—a

<head>Chapter 72 <del>LXI.</del>—Hilary. The Pure in Heart Blessed. The Doing and Perfecting of
Righteousness.</head>
<p>He quotes the following words from the blessed Hilary: “It is only when we shall be
perfect in spirit and changed in our immortal state, which blessedness has been appointed
only for the pure in heart,1308 that we shall see that which is immortal in God.”1309 Now I
am really not aware what is here said contrary to our own statement, or in what respect this
passage is of any use to our opponent, unless it be that it testifies to the possibility of a man’s
being “pure in heart.” But who denies such possibility? Only it must be by the grace of God,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, and not merely by our freedom of will. He goes on to quote
also this passage: “This Job had so effectually read these Scriptures, that he kept himself
from every wicked work, because he worshipped God purely with a mind unmixed with
offences: now such worship of God is the proper work of righteousness.”1310 It is what Job
had done which the writer here spoke of, not what he had brought to perfection in this
world,—much less what he had done or perfected without the grace of that Saviour whom
he had actually foretold.1311 For that man, indeed, abstains from every wicked work, who
does not allow the sin which he has within him to have dominion over him; and who,
whenever an unworthy thought stole over him, suffered it not to come to a head in actual
deed. It is, however, one thing not to have sin, and another to refuse obedience to its desires.
It is one thing to fulfil the command, “Thou shalt not covet;”1312 and another thing, by an
endeavour at any rate after abstinence, to do that which is also written, “Thou shalt not go
after thy lusts.”1313 And yet one is quite aware that he can do nothing of all this without the
Saviour’s grace. It is to work righteousness, therefore, to fight in an internal struggle with
the internal evil of concupiscence in the true worship of God; whilst to perfect it means to
have no adversary at all. Now he who has to fight is still in danger, and is sometimes shaken,
even if he is not overthrown; whereas he who has no enemy at all rejoices in perfect peace.
He, moreover, is in the highest truth said to be without sin in whom no sin has an indwelling,—
not he who, abstaining from evil deeds, uses such language as “Now it is no longer I
that do it, but the sin that dwelleth in me.”1314</p>

<head>Chapter 73.—He Meets Pelagius with Another Passage from Hilary.</head>
<p>Now even Job himself is not silent respecting his own sins; and your friend,1315 of course,
is justly of opinion that humility must not by any means “be put on the side of falsehood.”
Whatever confession, therefore, Job makes, inasmuch as he is a true worshipper of God, he
undoubtedly makes it in truth.1316 Hilary, likewise, while expounding that passage of the
psalm in which it is written, “Thou hast despised all those who turn aside from Thy commandments,”
1317 says: “If God were to despise sinners, He would despise indeed all men,
because no man is without sin; but it is those who turn away from Him, whom they call
apostates, that He despises.” You observe his statement: it is not to the effect that no man
was without sin, as if he spoke of the past; but no man is without sin; and on this point, as
I have already remarked, I have no contention with him. But if one refuses to submit to the
Apostle John,—who does not himself declare, “If we were to say we have had no sin,” but
“If we say we have no sin,”1318—how is he likely to show deference to Bishop Hilary? It is
in defence of the grace of Christ that I lift up my voice, without which grace no man is justified,—
just as if natural free will were sufficient. Nay, He Himself lifts up His own voice in
defence of the same. Let us submit to Him when He says: “Without me ye can do nothing.”

<head>Chapter 74 <del>LXIII.</del>—Ambrose.</head>
<p>St. Ambrose, however, really opposes those who say that man cannot exist without sin
in the present life. For, in order to support his statement, he avails himself of the instance
of Zacharias and Elisabeth, because they are mentioned as “having walked in all the commandments
and ordinances” of the law “blameless.”1320 Well, but does he for all that deny
that it was by God’s grace that they did this through our Lord Jesus Christ? It was undoubtedly
by such faith in Him that holy men lived of old, even before His death. It is He
who sends the Holy Ghost that is given to us, through whom that love is shed abroad in our
hearts whereby alone whosoever are righteous are righteous. This same Holy Ghost the
bishop expressly mentioned when he reminds us that He is to be obtained by prayer (so
that the will is not sufficient unless it be aided by Him); thus in his hymn he says:

<head>Chapter 75.—Augustin Adduces in Reply Some Other Passages of Ambrose.</head>
<p>I, too, will quote a passage out of this very work of St. Ambrose, from which our opponent
has taken the statement which he deemed favourable for citation: “‘It seemed good to me,’”
he says; “but what he declares seemed good to him cannot have seemed good to him alone.
For it is not simply to his human will that it seemed good, but also as it pleased Him, even
Christ, who, says he, speaketh in me, who it is that causes that which is good in itself to seem
good to ourselves also. For him on whom He has mercy He also calls. He, therefore, who
follows Christ, when asked why he wished to be a Christian, can answer: ‘It seemed good
to me.’ In saying this he does not deny that it also pleased God; for from God proceeds the
preparation of man’s will inasmuch as it is by God’s grace that God is honoured by His
saint.”1322 See now what your author must learn, if he takes pleasure in the words of Ambrose,
how that man’s will is prepared by God, and that it is of no importance, or, at any
rate, does not much matter, by what means or at what time the preparation is accomplished,
provided no doubt is raised as to whether the thing itself be capable of accomplishment
without the grace of Christ. Then, again, how important it was that he should observe one
line from the words of Ambrose which he quoted! For after that holy man had said, “Inas-
much as the Church has been gathered out of the world, that is, out of sinful men, how can
it be unpolluted when composed of such polluted material, except that, in the first place, it
be washed of sins by the grace of Christ, and then, in the next place, abstain from sins through
its nature of avoiding sin?”—he added the following sentence, which your author has refused
to quote for a self-evident reason; for [Ambrose] says: “It was not from the first unpolluted,
for that was impossible for human nature: but it is through God’s grace and nature that
because it no longer sins, it comes to pass that it seems unpolluted.”1323 Now who does not
understand the reason why your author declined adding these words? It is, of course, so
contrived in the discipline of the present life, that the holy Church shall arrive at last at that
condition of most immaculate purity which all holy men desire; and that it may in the world
to come, and in a state unmixed with anything of evil men, and undisturbed by any law of
sin resisting the law of the mind, lead the purest life in a divine eternity. Still he should well
observe what Bishop Ambrose says,—and his statement exactly tallies with the Scriptures:
“It was not from the first unpolluted, for that condition was impossible for human nature.”
By his phrase, “from the first,” he means indeed from the time of our being born of Adam.
Adam no doubt was himself created immaculate; in the case, however, of those who are by
nature children of wrath, deriving from him what in him was corrupted, he distinctly averred
that it was an impossibility in human nature that they should be immaculate from the first.</p>

<p>He quotes also John, bishop of Constantinople, as saying “that sin is not a substance,
but a wicked act.” Who denies this? “And because it is not natural, therefore the law was
given against it, and because it proceeds from the liberty of our will.”1324 Who, too, denies
this? However, the present question concerns our human nature in its corrupted state; it is
a further question also concerning that grace of God whereby our nature is healed by the
great Physician, Christ, whose remedy it would not need if it were only whole. And yet your
author defends it as capable of not sinning, as if it were sound, or as if its freedom of will
were self-sufficient.</p>

<head>Chapter 77.—Xystus.</head>
<p>What Christian, again, is unaware of what he quotes the most blessed Xystus, bishop
of Rome and martyr of Christ, as having said, “God has conferred upon men liberty of their
own will, in order that by purity and sinlessness of life they may become like unto God?”1325
But the man who appeals to free will ought to listen and believe, and ask Him in whom he
believes to give him His assistance not to sin. For when he speaks of “becoming like unto
God,” it is indeed through God’s love that men are to be like unto God,—even the love
which is “shed abroad in our hearts,” not by any ability of nature or the free will within us,
but “by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.”1326 Then, in respect of what the same
martyr further says, “A pure mind is a holy temple for God, and a heart clean and without
sin is His best altar,” who knows not that the clean heart must be brought to this perfection,
whilst “the inward man is renewed day by day,”1327 but yet not without the grace of God
through Jesus Christ our Lord? Again, when he says, “A man of chastity and without sin
has received power from God to be a son of God,” he of course meant it as an admonition
that on a man’s becoming so chaste and sinless (without raising any question as to where
and when this perfection was to be obtained by him,—although in fact it is quite an interesting
question among godly men, who are notwithstanding agreed as to the possibility of such
perfection on the one hand, and on the other hand its impossibility except through “the one
Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus”);1328—nevertheless, as I began to
say, Xystus designed his words to be an admonition that, on any man’s attaining such a high
character, and thereby being rightly reckoned to be among the sons of God, the attainment
must not be thought to have been the work of his own power. This indeed he, through grace,
received from God, since he did not have it in a nature which had become corrupted and
depraved,—even as we read in the Gospel, “But as many as received Him, to them gave He
power to become the sons of God;”1329 which they were not by nature, nor could at all become,
unless by receiving Him they also received power through His grace. This is the power
which is claimed for itself by the fortitude of that love which is only communicated to us
by the Holy Ghost bestowed upon us.</p>

exposition of the passage where it is written: “‘Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall
see God.’1330 These are they whom no consciousness of sin reproves,” he says, and adds:
“The pure man is seen by his purity of heart; the temple of God cannot be defiled.”1331 This
perfection is, to be sure, wrought in us by endeavour, by labour, by prayer, by effectual importunity
therein that we may be brought to the perfection in which we may be able to look
upon God with a pure heart, by His grace through our Lord Jesus Christ. As to his quotation,
that the forementioned presbyter said, “God created us with free will; we are drawn by necessity
neither to virtue nor to vice; otherwise, where there is necessity there is no crown;”
1332—who would not allow this? Who would not cordially accept it? Who would deny that
human nature was so created? The reason, however, why in doing a right action there is no
bondage of necessity, is that liberty comes of love.</p>

there is, owing to the defects that have entered our nature, not to the constitution of our
nature, a certain necessary tendency to sin, a man should listen, and in order that the said
necessity may cease to exist, learn to say to God, “Bring Thou me out of my necessities;”1335
because in the very offering up of such a prayer there is a struggle against the tempter, who
fights against us concerning this very necessity; and thus, by the assistance of grace through
our Lord Jesus Christ, both the evil necessity will be removed and full liberty be bestowed.</p>

<head>Chapter 80 <del>LXVII.</del>—Augustin Himself. Two Methods Whereby Sins, Like Diseases,
are Guarded Against.</head>
<p>Let us now turn to our own case. “Bishop Augustin also,” says your author, “in his books
on Free Will has these words: ‘Whatever the cause itself of volition is, if it is impossible to
resist it, submission to it is not sinful; if, however, it may be resisted, let it not be submitted
to, and there will be no sin. Does it, perchance, deceive the unwary man? Let him then beware
that he be not deceived. Is the deception, however, so potent that it is not possible to guard
against it? If such is the case, then there are no sins. For who sins in a case where precaution
is quite impossible? Sin, however, is committed; precaution therefore is possible.’”1336 I
acknowledge it, these are my words; but he, too, should condescend to acknowledge all that
was said previously, seeing that the discussion is about the grace of God, which helps us as
a medicine through the Mediator; not about the impossibility of righteousness. Whatever,
then, may be the cause, it can be resisted. Most certainly it can. Now it is because of this that
we pray for help, saying, “Lead us not into temptation,”1337 and we should not ask for help
if we supposed that the resistance were quite impossible. It is possible to guard against sin,
but by the help of Him who cannot be deceived.1338 For this very circumstance has much
to do with guarding against sin that we can unfeignedly say, “Forgive us our debt, as we
forgive our debtors.”1339 Now there are two ways whereby, even in bodily maladies, the evil
is guarded against,—to prevent its occurrence, and, if it happen, to secure a speedy cure. To
prevent its occurrence, we may find precaution in the prayer, “Lead us not into temptation;”
to secure the prompt remedy, we have the resource in the prayer, “Forgive us our debts.”
Whether then the danger only threaten or be inherent, it may be guarded against.</p>

<head>Chapter 81.—Augustin Quotes Himself on Free Will.</head>
<p>In order, however, that my meaning on this subject may be clear not merely to him, but
also to such persons as have not read those treatises of mine on Free Will, which your author
has read, and who have not only not read them, but perchance do read him; I must go on
to quote out of my books what he has omitted, but which, if he had perceived and quoted
in his book, no controversy would be left between us on this subject. For immediately after
those words of mine which he has quoted, I expressly added, and (as fully as I could) worked
out, the train of thought which might occur to any one’s mind, to the following effect: “And
yet some actions are disapproved of, even when they are done in ignorance, and are judged
deserving of chastisement, as we read in the inspired authorities.” After taking some examples
out of these, I went on to speak also of infirmity as follows: “Some actions also deserve disapprobation,
that are done from necessity; as when a man wishes to act rightly and cannot.
For whence arise those utterances: ‘For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which
I would not, that I do’?”1340 Then, after quoting some other passages of the Holy Scriptures
to the same effect, I say: “But all these are the sayings of persons who are coming out of that
condemnation of death; for if this is not man’s punishment, but his nature, then those are
no sins.” Then, again, a little afterwards I add: “It remains, therefore, that this just punishment
come of man’s condemnation. Nor ought it to be wondered at, that either by ignorance man
has not free determination of will to choose what he will rightly do, or that by the resistance
of carnal habit (which by force of mortal transmission has, in a certain sense, become engrafted
into his nature), though seeing what ought rightly to be done and wishing to do it,
he yet is unable to accomplish it. For this is the most just penalty of sin, that a man should
lose what he has been unwilling to make good use of, when he might with ease have done
so if he would; which, however, amounts to this, that the man who knowingly does not do
what is right loses the ability to do it when he wishes. For, in truth, to every soul that sins
there accrue these two penal consequences—ignorance and difficulty. Out of the ignorance
springs the error which disgraces; out of the difficulty arises the pain which afflicts. But to
approve of falsehoods as if they were true, so as to err involuntarily, and to be unable, owing
to the resistance and pain of carnal bondage, to refrain from deeds of lust, is not the nature
of man as he was created, but the punishment of man as under condemnation. When,
however, we speak of a free will to do what is right, we of course mean that liberty in which
man was created.” Some men at once deduce from this what seems to them a just objection
from the transfer and transmission of sins of ignorance and difficulty from the first man to
his posterity. My answer to such objectors is this: “I tell them, by way of a brief reply, to be
silent and to cease from murmuring against God. Perhaps their complaint might have been
a proper one, if no one from among men had stood forth a vanquisher of error and of lust;

but when there is everywhere present One who calls off from himself, through the creature
by so many means, the man who serves the Lord, teaches him when believing, consoles him
when hoping, encourages him when loving, helps him when endeavouring, hears him when
praying,—it is not reckoned to you as a fault that you are involuntarily ignorant, but that
you neglect to search out what you are ignorant of; nor is it imputed to you in censure that
you do not bind up the limbs that are wounded, but that you despise him who wishes to
heal them.”1341 In such terms did I exhort them, as well as I could, to live righteously; nor
did I make the grace of God of none effect, without which the now obscured and tarnished
nature of man can neither be enlightened nor purified. Our whole discussion with them on
this subject turns upon this, that we frustrate not the grace of God which is in Jesus Christ
our Lord by a perverted assertion of nature. In a passage occurring shortly after the last
quoted one, I said in reference to nature: “Of nature itself we speak in one sense, when we
properly describe it as that human nature in which man was created faultless after his kind;
and in another sense as that nature in which we are born ignorant and carnally minded,
owing to the penalty of condemnation, after the manner of the apostle, ‘We ourselves likewise
were by nature children of wrath, even as others.’”1342</p>

<p>If, therefore, we wish “to rouse and kindle cold and sluggish souls by Christian exhortations
to lead righteous lives,”1343 we must first of all exhort them to that faith whereby they
may become Christians, and be subjects of His name and authority, without whom they
cannot be saved. If, however, they are already Christians but neglect to lead holy lives, they
must be chastised with alarms and be aroused by the praises of reward,—in such a manner,
indeed, that we must not forget to urge them to godly prayers as well as to virtuous actions,
and furthermore to instruct them in such wholesome doctrine that they be induced thereby
to return thanks for being able to accomplish any step in that holy life which they have
entered upon, without difficulty,1344 and whenever they do experience such “difficulty,”
that they then wrestle with God in most faithful and persistent prayer and ready works of
mercy to obtain from Him facility. But provided they thus progress, I am not over-anxious
as to the where and the when of their perfection in fulness of righteousness; only I solemnly
assert, that wheresoever and whensoever they become perfect, it cannot be but by the grace
of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. When, indeed, they have attained to the clear
knowledge that they have no sin, let them not say they have sin, lest the truth be not in

<head>Chapter 83 <del>LXIX.</del>—God Enjoins No Impossibility, Because All Things are Possible
and Easy to Love.</head>
<p>But “the precepts of the law are very good,” if we use them lawfully.1346 Indeed, by the
very fact (of which we have the firmest conviction) “that the just and good God could not
possibly have enjoined impossibilities,” we are admonished both what to do in easy paths
and what to ask for when they are difficult. Now all things are easy for love to effect, to
which (and which alone) “Christ’s burden is light,”1347—or rather, it is itself alone the burden
which is light. Accordingly it is said, “And His commandments are not grievous;”1348 so
that whoever finds them grievous must regard the inspired statement about their “not being
grievous” as having been capable of only this meaning, that there may be a state of heart to
which they are not burdensome, and he must pray for that disposition which he at present
wants, so as to be able to fulfil all that is commanded him. And this is the purport of what
is said to Israel in Deuteronomy, if understood in a godly, sacred, and spiritual sense, since
the apostle, after quoting the passage, “The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy
heart”1349 (and, as the verse also has it, in thine hands,1350 for in man’s heart are his spiritual
hands), adds in explanation, “This is the word of faith which we preach.”1351 No man,
therefore, who “returns to the Lord his God,” as he is there commanded, “with all his heart
and with all his soul,”1352 will find God’s commandment “grievous.” How, indeed, can it
be grievous, when it is the precept of love? Either, therefore, a man has not love, and then
it is grievous; or he has love, and then it is not grievous. But he possesses love if he does
what is there enjoined on Israel, by returning to the Lord his God with all his heart and with
all his soul. “A new commandment,” says He, “do I give unto you, that ye love one another;”
1353 and “He that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law;”1354 and again, “Love is
the fulfilling of the law.”1355 In accordance with these sayings is that passage, “Had they
trodden good paths, they would have found, indeed, the ways of righteousness easy.”1356

<p>Inchoate love, therefore, is inchoate holiness; advanced love is advanced holiness; great
love is great holiness; “perfect love is perfect holiness,”—but this “love is out of a pure heart,
and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,”1358 “which in this life is then the greatest,
when life itself is contemned in comparison with it.”1359 I wonder, however, whether it has
not a soil in which to grow after it has quitted this mortal life! But in what place and at what
time soever it shall reach that state of absolute perfection, which shall admit of no increase,
it is certainly not “shed abroad in our hearts” by any energies either of the nature or the
volition that are within us, but “by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,”1360 “and which
both helps our infirmity and co-operates with our strength. For it is itself indeed the grace
of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, appertaineth
eternity, and all goodness, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>A TREATISE CONCERNING MAN’S PERFECTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS.</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<pb n="492"/>
<head>PREFACE TO THE TREATISE ON MAN’S PERFECTION IN
RIGHTEOUSNESS.</head>
<p>Augustin has made no mention of this treatise in his book of Retractations; for the
reason, no doubt, that it belonged to the collection of the Epistles, for which he designed a
separate statement of Retractations. In all the mss. this work begins with his usual epistolary
salutation: “Augustin, to his holy brethren and fellow-bishops Eutropius and Paulus.” And
yet, by general consent, this epistle has been received as a treatise, not only in those volumes
of his works which contain this work, but also in the writings of those ancient authors who
quote it. Amongst these, the most renowned and acquainted with Augustin’s writings,
Possidius (In indiculo, 4) and Fulgentius (Ad Monimum, i. 3) expressly call this work “A
Treatise on the Perfection of Man’s Righteousness.” So far nearly all the mss. agree, but a few
(including the Codd. Audöenensis and Pratellensis) add these words to the general title: “In
opposition to those who assert that it is possible for a man to become righteous by his own sole
strength.” In a ms. belonging to the Church of Rheims there occurs this inscription: “A
Treatise on what are called the definitions of Coelestius.” Prosper, in his work against the
Collator, ch. 43, advises his reader to read, besides some other of Augustin’s “books,” that
which he wrote “to the priests Paulus and Eutropius in opposition to the questions of Pelagius
and Coelestius.”</p>
<p>From this passage of Prosper, however, in which he mentions, but with no regard to
accurate order, some of the short treatises of Augustin against the Pelagians, nobody could
rightly show that this work On the Perfection of Man’s Righteousness was later in time than
his work On Marriage and Concupiscence, or than the six books against Julianus, which are
mentioned previously in the same passage by Prosper. For, indeed, at the conclusion of the
present treatise, Augustin hesitates as yet to censure those persons who affirmed that men
are living or have lived in this life righteously without any sin at all: their opinion Augustin,
in the passage referred to (just as in his treatises On Nature and Grace, n. 3, and On the
Spirit and the Letter, nn. 49, 70), does not yet think it necessary stoutly to resist. Nothing
had as yet, therefore, been determined on this point; nor were there yet enacted, in opposition
to this opinion, the three well-known canons (6–8) of the Council of Carthage, which was
held in the year 418. Afterwards, however, on the authority of these canons, he cautions
people against the opinion as a pernicious error, as one may see from many passages in his
books Against the two Epistles of the Pelagians, especially Book iv. ch. x. (27), where he says:
“Let us now consider that third point of theirs, which each individual member of Christ as
well as His entire body regards with horror, where they contend that there are in this life,
or have been, righteous persons without any sin whatever.” Certainly, in the year 414, in an
epistle (157) to Hilary, when answering the questions which were then being agitated in Sicily,

<pb n="493"/>
he expresses himself in the same tone, and almost in the same language, on sinlessness, as
that which he employs at the end of this present treatise. “But those persons,” says he (in
ch. ii. n. 4 of that epistle), “however much one may tolerate them when they affirm that
there either are, or have been, men besides the one Saint of saints who have been wholly
free from sin; yet when they allege that man’s own free will is sufficient for fulfilling the
Lord’s commandments, even when unassisted by God’s grace and the gift of the Holy Spirit
for the performance of good works, the idea is altogether worthy of anathema and of perfect
detestation.” On comparing these words with the conclusion of this treatise before us,
nothing will appear more probable than that the work which supplies the refutation of
Coelestius’ questions, which were also brought over from Sicily, was written not long after
the above-mentioned epistle. This work Possidius, in his index, places immediately after
the treatise On Nature and Grace, and before the book On the Proceedings of Pelagius. Augustin,
however, does not mention this work in his epistle (169) which he addressed to
Evodius about the end of the year 415; but he intimates in it that he had published an answer
to the Commonitorium of Orosius, wherein that author stated that “the bishops Eutropius
and Paulus had already given information to Augustin about certain formidable heresies.”
Some suppose that this statement refers to the letter which they despatched to Augustin
along with Coelestius’ propositions. However that be, it is not unreasonable to believe that
they, not long after Orosius’ arrival in Africa (that is, before the midsummer of the year
415), had sent these propositions to him, and that Augustin soon afterwards wrote back to
Eutropius and Paulus a refutation of them, his answer to Orosius having been previously
given.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Coelestius, whose name is inscribed in the propositions, “wrote to his
parents from his monastery,” as Gennadius informs us in his work on Church writers (De
Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis), “before he fell in with the teaching of Pelagius, three letters in
the shape of short treatises, necessary for all seekers after God.” Afterwards he openly professed
the Pelagian heresy, and published a short treatise, in which, besides other topics, he
acknowledged in the Church of Carthage that even infants had redemption by being baptized
into Christ,—an episcopal decision on the question having been obtained in that city about
the commencement of the year 412, as we learn from an epistle to Pope Innocent (amongst
the Epistles of Augustin [175, n. 1 and 6]), as well as from the epistle [157, n. 22] which we
have referred to above; and from Augustin’s work On the Merits of Sins, i. 62, and ii. 59; also
from his treatise On Original Sin, 21; and his work Against Julianus, iii. 9. Another work
by an anonymous writer, but which was commonly attributed to Coelestius, divided into
chapters, is mentioned in the treatise which follows the present one, On the Proceedings of
Pelagius; see chapters 29, 30, and 62. There were extant, moreover, in the year 417, several
small books or tracts of Coelestius, which Augustin, in his work On the Grace of Christ, 31,
32, and 36, says were produced by Coelestius himself in some ecclesiastical proceedings at

<pb n="494"/>
Rome under Zosimus. Augustin, at the commencement of the present work On the Perfection
of Man’s Righteousness, mentions an undoubted work of Coelestius as having been seen by
him, from which he discovered that the definitions or propositions therein examined by
Augustin were not unsuited to the tone and temper of Coelestius. This was very probably
the book which Jerome quotes in his Epistle to Ctesiphon, written in the year 413 or 414.
These are Jerome’s words: “One of his followers [that is, Pelagius’], who was already in fact
become the master and the leader of all that army, and ‘a vessel of wrath,’1361 in opposition
to the apostle, runs on through thickets, not of syllogisms, as his admirers are apt to boast,
but of solecisms, and philosophizes and disputes to the following effect: ‘If I do nothing
without God’s help, and if everything which I shall achieve is owing to His operations solely,
then it follows that it is not I who work, but only God’s work is to be crowned in me. In
vain, therefore, has He conferred on me the power of will, if I am unable to exercise it fully
without His incessant help. That volition, indeed, is destroyed which requires the assistance
of another. But it is free will which God has given to me; and free it can only remain, if I do
whatever I wish. The state of the case then is this: I either use once for all the power which
has been bestowed on me, so that free will is preserved; or else, if I require the assistance of
another, liberty of decision in me is destroyed.’”</p>

<head>A TREATISE CONCERNING MAN’S PERFECTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS,
BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;</head>
<p>In One Book,
addressed to eutropius and paulus, a.d. 415.</p>
<p>A paper containing sundry definitions,1362 said to have been drawn up by Coelestius, was put
into the hands of Augustin. In this document, Coelestius, or some person who shared in
his errors, had recklessly asserted that a man had it in his power to live here without sin.
Augustin first refutes the several propositions in brief answers, showing that the perfect
and plenary state of righteousness, in which a man exists absolutely without sin, is unattainable
without grace by the mere resources of our corrupt nature, and never occurs in
this present state of existence. He next proceeds to consider the authorities which the paper
contained as gathered out of the Scriptures; some of them teaching man to be “unspotted”
and “perfect;” others mentioning the commandments of God as “not grievous;” while
others again are quoted as opposed to the authoritative passages which the Catholics were
accustomed to advance against the Pelagians.</p>
<note type="footnote">1362 These breves definitiones, which Augustin also calls ratiocinationes, are short argumentative statements,
which may be designated breviates.</note>

<p>Your love, which in both of you is so great and so holy that it is a delight to obey its
commands, has laid me under an obligation to reply to some definitions which are said to
be the work of Coelestius; for so runs the title of the paper which you have given me, “The
definitions, so it is said, of Coelestius.” As for this title, I take it that it is not his, but theirs
who have brought this work from Sicily, where Coelestius is said not to be,—although many
there1364 make boastful pretension of holding views like his, and, to use the apostle’s word,
“being themselves deceived, lead others also astray.”1365 That these views are, however, his,
or those of some associates1366 of his, we, too, can well believe. For the above-mentioned
brief definitions, or rather propositions, are by no means at variance with his opinion, such
as I have seen it expressed in another work, of which he is the undoubted author. There was
therefore good reason, I think, for the report which those brethren, who brought these tidings
to us, heard in Sicily, that Coelestius taught or wrote such opinions. I should like, if it were
possible, so to meet the obligation imposed on me by your brotherly kindness, that I, too,
in my own answer should be equally brief. But unless I set forth also the propositions which
I answer, who will be able to form a judgment of the value of my answer? Still I will try to
the best of my ability, assisted, too, by God’s mercy, by your own prayers, so to conduct the
discussion as to keep it from running to an unnecessary length.</p>

<note type="footnote">1364 In his epistle (157) to Hilary, written a little while before this work, he mentions Coelestius and the
condemnation of his errors in a Council held at Carthage; he expresses also some apprehension of Coelestius
attempting to spread his opinions in Sicily: “Whether he be himself there,” says Augustin, “or only others who
are partners in his errors, there are too many of them; and, unless they be checked, they lead astray others to
join their sect; and so great is their increase, that I cannot tell whither they will force their way,” etc.</note>

<head>Chapter II.</head>
<p>(1.) The First Breviate of Coelestius.</p>
<p>I. “First of all,” says he, “he must be asked who denies man’s ability to live without sin,
what every sort of sin is,—is it such as can be avoided? or is it unavoidable? If it is unavoidable,
then it is not sin; if it can be avoided, then a man can live without the sin which can
be avoided. No reason or justice permits us to designate as sin what cannot in any way be
avoided.” Our answer to this is, that sin can be avoided, if our corrupted nature be healed
by God’s grace, through our Lord Jesus Christ. For, in so far as it is not sound, in so far does
it either through blindness fail to see, or through weakness fail to accomplish, that which it
ought to do; “for the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh,”1367 so
that a man does not do the things which he would.</p>
<note type="footnote">1367 Gal. v. 17.</note>

<pb n="498"/>
<p>(2.) The Second Breviate.</p>
<p>II. “We must next ask,” he says, “whether sin comes from will, or from necessity? If
from necessity, it is not sin; if from will, it can be avoided.” We answer as before; and in
order that we may be healed, we pray to Him to whom it is said in the psalm: “Lead Thou
me out of my necessities.”1368</p>
<note type="footnote">1368 Ps. xxv. 17.</note>

<pb n="499"/>
<p>(3.) The Third Breviate.</p>
<p>III. “Again we must ask,” he says, “what sin is,—natural? or accidental? If natural, it is
not sin; if accidental, it is separable;1369 and if it is separable, it can be avoided; and because
it can be avoided, man can be without that which can be avoided.” The answer to this is,
that sin is not natural; but nature (especially in that corrupt state from which we have become
by nature “children of wrath”1370) has too little determination of will to avoid sin, unless
assisted and healed by God’s grace through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<note type="footnote">1369 [An accident “is a modification or quality which does not essentially belong to a thing, nor form one
of its constituent or invariable attributes: as motion in relation to matter, or heat to iron.”—Fleming: Vocabulary
of Philosophy.—W.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1370 Eph. ii. 3.</note>

<pb n="500"/>
<p>(4.) The Fourth Breviate.</p>
<p>IV. “We must ask, again,” he says, “What is sin,—an act, or a thing? If it is a thing, it
must have an author; and if it be said to have an author, then another besides God will seem
to be introduced as the author of a thing. But if it is impious to say this, we are driven to
confess that every sin is an act, not a thing. If therefore it is an act, for this very reason, because
it is an act, it can be avoided.” Our reply is, that sin no doubt is called an act, and is
such, not a thing. But likewise in the body, lameness for the same reason is an act, not a
thing, since it is the foot itself, or the body, or the man who walks lame because of an injured
foot, that is the thing; but still the man cannot avoid the lameness, unless his foot be cured.
The same change may take place in the inward man, but it is by God’s grace, through our
Lord Jesus Christ. The defect itself which causes the lameness of the man is neither the foot,
nor the body, nor the man, nor indeed the lameness itself; for there is of course no lameness
when there is no walking, although there is nevertheless the defect which causes the lameness
whenever there is an attempt to walk. Let him therefore ask, what name must be given to
this defect,—would he have it called a thing, or an act, or rather a bad property1371 in the
thing, by which the deformed act comes into existence? So in the inward man the soul is
the thing, theft is an act, and avarice is the defect, that is, the property by which the soul is
evil, even when it does nothing in gratification of its avarice, even when it hears the prohibition,
“Thou shalt not covet,”1372 and censures itself, and yet remains avaricious. By faith,
however, it receives renovation; in other words, it is healed day by day,1373—yet only by
God’s grace through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<note type="footnote">1371 [Coelestius had in the previous breviate confined sin to either nature or accident: Augustin declares it
to be a property. By this he apparently means that it is a non-essential attribute, without which man would remain
man, but yet not what is called a “separable accident.”—W.]</note>

<head>Chapter III.</head>
<p>(5.) The Fifth Breviate.</p>
<p>V. “We must again,” he says, “inquire whether a man ought to be without sin. Beyond
doubt he ought. If he ought, he is able; if he is not able, then he ought not. Now if a man
ought not to be without sin, it follows that he ought to be with sin,—and then it ceases to
be sin at all, if it is determined that it is owed. Or if it is absurd to say this, we are obliged to
confess that man ought to be without sin; and it is clear that his obligation is not more than
his ability.” We frame our answer with the same illustration that we employed in our previous
reply. When we see a lame man who has the opportunity of being cured of his lameness, we
of course have a right to say: “That man ought not to be lame; and if he ought, he is able.”
And yet whenever he wishes he is not immediately able; but only after he has been cured
by the application of the remedy, and the medicine has assisted his will. The same thing
takes place in the inward man in relation to sin which is its lameness, by the grace of Him
who “came not to call the righteous, but sinners;”1374 since “the whole need not the physician,
but only they that be sick.”1375</p>
<note type="footnote">1374 Matt. ix. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">1375 Matt. ix. 12.</note>

<pb n="502"/>
<p>(6.) The Sixth Breviate.</p>
<p>VI. “Again,” he says, “we have to inquire whether man is commanded to be without
sin; for either he is not able, and then he is not commanded; or else because he is commanded,
he is able. For why should that be commanded which cannot at all be done?” The answer
is, that man is most wisely commanded to walk with right steps, on purpose that, when he
has discovered his own inability to do even this, he may seek the remedy which is provided
for the inward man to cure the lameness of sin, even the grace of God, through our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<pb n="503"/>
<p>(7.) The Seventh Breviate.</p>
<p>VII. “The next question we shall have to propose,” he says, “is, whether God wishes that
man be without sin. Beyond doubt God wishes it; and no doubt he has the ability. For who
is so foolhardy as to hesitate to believe that to be possible, which he has no doubt about
God’s wishing?” This is the answer. If God wished not that man should be without sin, He
would not have sent His Son without sin, to heal men of their sins. This takes place in believers
who are being renewed day by day,1376 until their righteousness becomes perfect,
like fully restored health.</p>
<note type="footnote">1376 2 Cor. iv. 16.</note>

<pb n="504"/>
<p>(8.) The Eighth Breviate.</p>
<p>VIII. “Again, this question must be asked,” he says, “how God wishes man to be,—with
sin, or without sin? Beyond doubt, He does not wish him to be with sin. We must reflect
how great would be the impious blasphemy for it to be said that man has it in his power to
be with sin, which God does not wish; and for it to be denied that he has it in his power to
be without sin, which God wishes: just as if God had created any man for such a result as
this,—that he should be able to be what He would not have him, and unable to be what He
would have him; and that he should lead an existence contrary to His will, rather than one
which should be in accordance therewith.” This has been in fact already answered; but I see
that it is necessary for me to make here an additional remark, that we are saved by hope.
“But hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if
we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.” 1377 Full righteousness,
therefore, will only then be reached, when fulness of health is attained; and this fulness of
health shall be when there is fulness of love, for “love is the fulfilling of the law;”1378 and
then shall come fulness of love, when “we shall see Him even as He is.”1379 Nor will any
addition to love be possible more, when faith shall have reached the fruition of sight.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.</head>
<p>(9.) The Ninth Breviate.</p>
<p>IX. “The next question we shall require to be solved,” says he, “is this: By what means
is it brought about that man is with sin?—by the necessity of nature, or by the freedom of
choice? If it is by the necessity of nature, he is blameless; if by the freedom of choice, then
the question arises, from whom he has received this freedom of choice. No doubt, from
God. Well, but that which God bestows is certainly good. This cannot be gainsaid. On what
principle, then, is a thing proved to be good, if it is more prone to evil than to good? For it
is more prone to evil than to good if by means of it man can be with sin and cannot be
without sin.” The answer is this: It came by the freedom of choice that man was with sin;
but a penal corruption closely followed thereon, and out of the liberty produced necessity.
Hence the cry of faith to God, “Lead Thou me out of my necessities.”1380 With these necessities
upon us, we are either unable to understand what we want, or else (while having the
wish) we are not strong enough to accomplish what we have come to understand. Now it
is just liberty itself that is promised to believers by the Liberator. “If the Son,” says He, “shall
make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”1381 For, vanquished by the sin into which it fell by
its volition, nature has lost liberty. Hence another scripture says, “For of whom a man is
overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.”1382 Since therefore “the whole need not
the physician, but only they that be sick;”1383 so likewise it is not the free that need the Deliverer,
but only the enslaved. Hence the cry of joy to Him for deliverance, “Thou hast saved
my soul from the straits of necessity.”1384 For true liberty is also real health; and this would
never have been lost, if the will had remained good. But because the will has sinned, the
hard necessity of having sin has pursued the sinner; until his infirmity be wholly healed,
and such freedom be regained, that there must needs be, on the one hand, a permanent will
to live happily, and, on the other hand, a voluntary and happy necessity of living virtuously,
and never sinning.</p>

<p>(10.) The Tenth Breviate.</p>
<p>X. “Since God made man good,” he says, “and, besides making him good, further commanded
him to do good, how impious it is for us to hold that man is evil, when he was
neither made so, nor so commanded; and to deny him the ability of being good, although
he was both made so, and commanded to act so!” Our answer here is: Since then it was not
man himself, but God, who made man good; so also is it God, and not man himself, who
remakes him to be good, while liberating him from the evil which he himself did upon his
wishing, believing, and invoking such a deliverance. But all this is effected by the renewal
day by day of the inward man,1385 by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, with
a view to the outward man’s resurrection at the last day to an eternity not of punishment,
but of life.</p>

<pb n="507"/>
<head>Chapter V.</head>
<p>(11.) The Eleventh Breviate.</p>
<p>XI. “The next question which must be put,” he says, “is, in how many ways all sin is
manifested? In two, if I mistake not: if either those things are done which are forbidden, or
those things are not done which are commanded. Now, it is just as certain that all things
which are forbidden are able to be avoided, as it is that all things which are commanded are
able to be effected. For it is vain either to forbid or to enjoin that which cannot either be
guarded against or accomplished. And how shall we deny the possibility of man’s being
without sin, when we are compelled to admit that he can as well avoid all those things which
are forbidden, as do all those which are commanded?” My answer is, that in the Holy
Scriptures there are many divine precepts, to mention the whole of which would be too laborious;
but the Lord, who on earth consummated and abridged1386 His word, expressly
declared that the law and the prophets hung on two commandments,1387 that we might
understand that whatever else has been enjoined on us by God ends in these two commandments,
and must be referred to them: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;”1388 and “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.”1389 “On these two commandments,” says He, “hang all the law and the prophets.”
1390 Whatever, therefore, we are by God’s law forbidden, and whatever we are bidden
to do, we are forbidden and bidden with the direct object of fulfilling these two commandments.
And perhaps the general prohibition is, “Thou shalt not covet;”1391 and the general
precept, “Thou shalt love.”1392 Accordingly the Apostle Paul, in a certain place, briefly embraced
the two, expressing the prohibition in these words, “Be not conformed to this
world,”1393 and the command in these, “But be ye transformed by the renewing of your
mind.”1394 The former falls under the negative precept, not to covet; the latter under the
positive one, to love. The one has reference to continence, the other to righteousness. The
one enjoins avoidance of evil; the other, pursuit of good. By eschewing covetousness we put
off the old man, and by showing love we put on the new. But no man can be continent unless
God endow him with the gift;1395 nor is God’s love shed abroad in our hearts by our own

selves, but by the Holy Ghost that is given to us.1396 This, however, takes place day after
day in those who advance by willing, believing, and praying, and who, “forgetting those
things which are behind, reach forth unto those things which are before.”1397 For the reason
why the law inculcates all these precepts is, that when a man has failed in fulfilling them, he
may not be swollen with pride, and so exalt himself, but may in very weariness betake himself
to grace. Thus the law fulfils its office as “schoolmaster,” so terrifying the man as “to lead
him to Christ,” to give Him his love.1398</p>

<p>(12.) The Twelfth Breviate.</p>
<p>XII. “Again the question arises,” he says, “how it is that man is unable to be without
sin,—by his will, or by nature? If by nature, it is not sin; if by his will, then will can very
easily be changed by will.” We answer by reminding him how he ought to reflect on the
extreme presumption of saying—not simply that it is possible (for this no doubt is undeniable,
when God’s grace comes in aid), but—that it is “very easy” for will to be changed by will;
whereas the apostle says, “The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh:
and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye do not the things that ye would.”1399
He does not say, “These are contrary the one to the other, so that ye will not do the things
that ye can,” but, “so that ye do not the things that ye would.”1400 How happens it, then,
that the lust of the flesh which of course is culpable and corrupt, and is nothing else than
the desire for sin, as to which the same apostle instructs us not to let it “reign in our mortal
body;”1401 by which expression he shows us plainly enough that that must have an existence
in our mortal body which must not be permitted to hold a dominion in it;—how happens
it, I say, that such lust of the flesh has not been changed by that will, which the apostle clearly
implied the existence of in his words, “So that ye do not the things that ye would,” if so be
that the will can so easily be changed by will? Not that we, indeed, by this argument throw
the blame upon the nature either of the soul or of the body, which God created, and which
is wholly good; but we say that it, having been corrupted by its own will, cannot be made
whole without the grace of God.</p>

whose fault is it,—man’s own, or some one’s else? If man’s own, in what way is it his fault
if he is not that which he is unable to be?” We reply, that it is man’s fault that he is not
without sin on this account, because it has by man’s sole will come to pass that he has come
into such a necessity as cannot be overcome by man’s sole will.</p>

but Marcion or Manichæus will venture to deny, in what way is it good if it is impossible
for it to be free from evil? For that all sin is evil who can gainsay?” We answer, that man’s
nature is both good, and is also able to be free from evil. Therefore do we earnestly pray,
“Deliver us from evil.”1402 This deliverance, indeed, is not fully wrought, so long as the soul
is oppressed by the body, which is hastening to corruption.1403 This process, however, is
being effected by grace through faith, so that it may be said by and by, “O death, where is
thy struggle? Where is thy sting, O death? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin
is the law;”1404 because the law by prohibiting sin only increases the desire for it, unless the
Holy Ghost spreads abroad that love, which shall then be full and perfect, when we shall see
face to face.</p>

be denied. But God imputes every sin to man. This too, I suppose, must be allowed, that
whatever shall not be imputed as sin is not sin. Now if there is any sin which is unavoidable,
how is God said to be righteous, when He is supposed to impute to any man that which
cannot be avoided?” We reply, that long ago was it declared in opposition to the proud,
“Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin.”1405 Now He does not impute it
to those who say to Him in faith, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”1406 And
justly does He withhold this imputation, because that is just which He says: “With what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”1407 That, however, is sin in which there
is either not the love which ought to be, or where the love is less than it ought to
be,1408—whether it can be avoided by the human will or not; because when it can be avoided,
the man’s present will does it, but if it cannot be avoided his past will did it; and yet it can
be avoided,—not, however, when the proud will is lauded, but when the humble one is assisted.</p>

<p>(16.) The Sixteenth Breviate.</p>
<p>XVI. After all these disputations, their author introduces himself in person as arguing
with another, and represents himself as under examination, and as being addressed by his
examiner: “Show me the man who is without sin.” He answers: “I show you one who is able
to be without sin.” His examiner then says to him: “And who is he?” He answers: “You are
the man.” “But if,” he adds, “you were to say, ‘I, at any rate, cannot be without sin,’ then you
must answer me, ‘Whose fault is that?’ If you then were to say, ‘My own fault,’ you must be
further asked, ‘And how is it your fault, if you cannot be without sin?’” He again represents
himself as under examination, and thus accosted: “Are you yourself without sin, who say
that a man can be without sin?” And he answers: “Whose fault is it that I am not without
sin? But if,” continues he, “he had said in reply, ‘The fault is your own;’ then the answer
would be, ‘How my fault, when I am unable to be without sin?’” Now our answer to all this
running argument is, that no controversy ought to have been raised between them about
such words as these; because he nowhere ventures to affirm that a man (either any one else,
or himself) is without sin, but he merely said in reply that he can be,—a position which we
do not ourselves deny. Only the question arises, when can he, and through whom can he?
If at the present time, then by no faithful soul which is enclosed within the body of this death
must this prayer be offered, or such words as these be spoken, “Forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors,”1409 since in holy baptism all past debts have been already forgiven.
But whoever tries to persuade us that such a prayer is not proper for faithful members of
Christ, does in fact acknowledge nothing else than that he is not himself a Christian. If,
again, it is through himself that a man is able to live without sin, then did Christ die in vain.
But “Christ is not dead in vain.” No man, therefore, can be without sin, even if he wish it,
unless he be assisted by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. And that this perfection
may be attained, there is even now a training carried on in growing [Christians,]
and there will be by all means a completion made, after the conflict with death is spent, and
love, which is now cherished by the operation of faith and hope, shall be perfected in the
fruition of sight and possession.</p>

<p>(17.) It is One Thing to Depart from the Body, Another Thing to Be
Liberated from the Body of This Death.</p>
<p>He next proposes to establish his point by the testimony of Holy Scripture. Let us carefully
observe what kind of defence he makes. “There are passages,” says he, “which prove
that man is commanded to be without sin.” Now our answer to this is: Whether such commands
are given is not at all the point in question, for the fact is clear enough; but whether
the thing which is evidently commanded be itself at all possible of accomplishment in the
body of this death, wherein “the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh, so that we cannot do the things that we would.”1410 Now from this body of death not
every one is liberated who ends the present life, but only he who in this life has received
grace, and given proof of not receiving it in vain by spending his days in good works. For
it is plainly one thing to depart from the body, which all men are obliged to do in the last
day of their present life, and another to be delivered from the body of this death,—which
God’s grace alone, through our Lord Jesus Christ, imparts to His faithful saints. It is after
this life, indeed, that the reward of perfection is bestowed, but only upon those by whom in
their present life has been acquired the merit of such a recompense. For no one, after going
hence, shall arrive at fulness of righteousness, unless, whilst here, he shall have run his course
by hungering and thirsting after it. “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness; for they shall be filled.”1411</p>

<p>(18.) The Righteousness of This Life Comprehended in Three Parts,—Fasting,
Almsgiving, and Prayer.</p>
<p>As long, then, as we are “absent from the Lord, we walk by faith, not by sight;”1412
whence it is said, “The just shall live by faith.”1413 Our righteousness in this pilgrimage is
this—that we press forward to that perfect and full righteousness in which there shall be
perfect and full love in the sight of His glory; and that now we hold to the rectitude and
perfection of our course, by “keeping under our body and bringing it into subjection,”1414
by doing our alms cheerfully and heartily, while bestowing kindnesses and forgiving the
trespasses which have been committed against us, and by “continuing instant in prayer;”
1415—and doing all this with sound doctrine, whereon are built a right faith, a firm hope,
and a pure charity. This is now our righteousness, in which we pass through our course
hungering and thirsting after the perfect and full righteousness, in order that we may hereafter
be satisfied therewith. Therefore our Lord in the Gospel (after saying, “Take heed that ye
do not your righteousness1416 before men, to be seen of them,”1417) in order that we should
not measure our course of life by the limit of human glory, declared in his exposition of
righteousness itself that there is none except there be these three,—fasting, alms, prayers.
Now in the fasting He indicates the entire subjugation of the body; in the alms, all kindness
of will and deed, either by giving or forgiving; and in prayers He implies all the rules of a
holy desire. So that, although by the subjugation of the body a check is given to that concupiscence,
which ought not only to be bridled but to be put altogether out of existence (and
which will not be found at all in that state of perfect righteousness, where sin shall be absolutely
excluded),—yet it often exerts its immoderate desire even in the use of things which
are allowable and right. In that real beneficence in which the just man consults his neighbour’s
welfare, things are sometimes done which are prejudicial, although it was thought that they
would be advantageous. Sometimes, too, through infirmity, when the amount of the kindness
and trouble which is expended either falls short of the necessities of the objects, or is of little
use under the circumstances, then there steals over us a disappointment which tarnishes
that “cheerfulness” which secures to the “giver” the approbation of God.1418 This trail of

sadness, however, is the greater or the less, as each man has made more or less progress in
his kindly purposes. If, then, these considerations, and such as these, be duly weighed, we
are only right when we say in our prayers, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors.”1419 But what we say in our prayers we must carry into act, even to loving our very
enemies; or if any one who is still a babe in Christ fails as yet to reach this point, he must at
any rate, whenever one who has trespassed against him repents and craves his pardon, exercise
forgiveness from the bottom of his heart, if he would have his heavenly Father listen to
his prayer.</p>

<p>(19.) The Commandment of Love Shall Be Perfectly Fulfilled in the Life to Come.</p>
<p>And in this prayer, unless we choose to be contentious, there is placed before our view
a mirror of sufficient brightness in which to behold the life of the righteous, who live by
faith, and finish their course, although they are not without sin. Therefore they say, “Forgive
us,” because they have not yet arrived at the end of their course. Hence the apostle says,
“Not as if I had already attained, either were already perfect. . .Brethren, I count not myself
to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of
the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus
minded.”1420 In other words, let us, as many as are running perfectly, be thus resolved, that,
being not yet perfected, we pursue our course to perfection along the way by which we have
thus far run perfectly, in order that “when that which is perfect is come, then that which is
in part may be done away;”1421 that is, may cease to be but in part any longer, but become
whole and complete. For to faith and hope shall succeed at once the very substance itself,
no longer to be believed in and hoped for, but to be seen and grasped. Love, however, which
is the greatest among the three, is not to be superseded, but increased and fulfilled,—contemplating
in full vision what it used to see by faith, and acquiring in actual fruition what
it once only embraced in hope. Then in all this plenitude of charity will be fulfilled the
commandment, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind.”1422 For while there remains any remnant of the lust of the
flesh, to be kept in check by the rein of continence, God is by no means loved with all one’s
soul. For the flesh does not lust without the soul; although it is the flesh which is said to lust,
because the soul lusts carnally. In that perfect state the just man shall live absolutely without
any sin, since there will be in his members no law warring against the law of his mind,1423
but wholly will he love God, with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his mind1424
which is the first and chief commandment. For why should not such perfection be enjoined
on man, although in this life nobody may attain to it? For we do not rightly run if we do
not know whither we are to run. But how could it be known, unless it were pointed out in
precepts?1425 Let us therefore “so run that we may obtain.”1426 For all who run rightly will

strength may be helped as we run; and let us so listen to the commandments which urge us
to perfection, as not to neglect running towards the fulness of love.</p>

<p>(20.) Who May Be Said to Walk Without Spot; Damnable and Venial
Sins.</p>
<p>Having premised these remarks, let us carefully attend to the passages which he whom
we are answering has produced, as if we ourselves had quoted them. “In Deuteronomy,
‘Thou shalt be perfect before the Lord thy God.’1428 Again, in the same book, ‘There shall
be not an imperfect man1429 among the sons of Israel.’1430 In like manner the Saviour says
in the Gospel, Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.’1431 So the
apostle, in his second Epistle to the Corinthians, says: ‘Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect.’
1432 Again, to the Colossians he writes: ‘Warning every man, and teaching every man
in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.’1433 And so to the Philippians:
‘Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless,
as the immaculate sons of God.’1434 In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: ‘Blessed be
the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation
of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.’1435 Then again to the Colossians
he says in another passage: ‘And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies
in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through
death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.’1436 In the
same strain, he says to the Ephesians: ‘That He might present to Himself a glorious Church,
not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.’
1437 So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says ‘Be ye sober, and righteous, and
sin not.’1438 So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written: ‘Wherefore gird up the loins of
your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient
children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as

He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is
written,1439 Be ye holy; for I am holy.’1440 Whence blessed David likewise says: ‘O Lord,
who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that
walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.’1441 And in another passage: ‘I shall be
blameless with Him.’1442 And yet again: ‘Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in
the law of the Lord.’1443 To the same effect it is written in Solomon: ‘The Lord loveth holy
hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.’”1444 Now some of these
passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to
the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably
said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but
who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at
the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way
in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer.
That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, “Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.”
1445 So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold
on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state,
when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires
cleansing by forgiveness.</p>

<p>(21.) To Whom God’s Commandments are Grievous; And to Whom,
Not. Why Scripture Says that God’s Commandments are Not Grievous; A
Commandment is a Proof of the Freedom Of Man’s Will; Prayer is a Proof of
Grace.</p>
<p>He next quotes passages to show that God’s commandments are not grievous. But who
can be ignorant of the fact that, since the generic commandment is love (for “the end of the
commandment is love,”1446 and “love is the fulfilling of the law”1447), whatever is accomplished
by the operation of love, and not of fear, is not grievous? They, however, are oppressed
by the commandments of God, who try to fulfil them by fearing. “But perfect love casteth
out fear;”1448 and, in respect of the burden of the commandment, it not only takes off the
pressure of its heavy weight, but it actually lifts it up as if on wings. In order, however, that
this love may be possessed, even as far as it can possibly be possessed in the body of this
death, the determination of will avails but little, unless it be helped by God’s grace through
our Lord Jesus Christ. For as it must again and again be stated, it is “shed abroad in our
hearts,” not by our own selves, but “by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.”1449 And for
no other reason does Holy Scripture insist on the truth that God’s commandments are not
grievous, than this, that the soul which finds them grievous may understand that it has not
yet received those resources which make the Lord’s commandments to be such as they are
commended to us as being, even gentle and pleasant; and that it may pray with groaning of
the will to obtain the gift of facility. For the man who says, “Let my heart be blameless;” 1450
and, “Order Thou my steps according to Thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion
over me;”1451 and, “Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven;”1452 and, “Lead us not into
temptation;”1453 and other prayers of a like purport, which it would be too long to particularize,
does in effect offer up a prayer for ability to keep God’s commandments. Neither,
indeed, on the one hand, would any injunctions be laid upon us to keep them, if our own
will had nothing to do in the matter; nor, on the other hand, would there be any room for
prayer, if our will were alone sufficient. God’s commandments, therefore, are commended
to us as being not grievous, in order that he to whom they are grievous may understand that

<p>He afterwards adduces those passages which represent God as recommending His own
commandments as not grievous: let us now attend to their testimony. “Because,” says he,
“God’s commandments are not only not impossible, but they are not even grievous. In
Deuteronomy: ‘The Lord thy God will again turn and rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced
over thy fathers, if ye shall hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep His
commandments, and His ordinances, and His judgments, written in the book of this law;
if thou turn to the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. For this command,
which I give thee this day, is not grievous, neither is it far from thee: it is not in heaven, that
thou shouldest say, Who will ascend into heaven, and obtain it for us, that we may hear and
do it? neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who will cross over the sea, and
obtain it for us, that we may hear and do it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in
thine heart, and in thine hands to do it.’1455 In the Gospel likewise the Lord says: ‘Come
unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.’1456 So also in the Epistle of Saint John
it is written: ‘This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments
are not grievous.’”1457 On hearing these testimonies out of the law, and the gospel,
and the epistles, let us be built up unto that grace which those persons do not understand,
who, “being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.”1458 For, if they understand
not the passage of Deuteronomy in the sense that the Apostle Paul quoted it,—that
“with the heart men believe unto righteousness, and with their mouth make confession
unto salvation;”1459 since “they that be whole need not a physician, but they that are
sick,”1460—they certainly ought (by that very passage of the Apostle John which he quoted
last to this effect: “This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments
are not grievous”1461) to be admonished that God’s commandment is not
grievous to the love of God, which is shed abroad in our hearts only by the Holy Ghost, not
by the determination of man’s will by attributing to which more than they ought, they are

<p>(23.) Passages of Scripture Which, When Objected Against Him by
the Catholics, Coelestius Endeavours to Elude by Other Passages: the First Passage.</p>
<p>After this he adduced the passages which are usually quoted against them. He does not
attempt to explain these passages, but, by quoting what seem to be contrary ones, he has
entangled the questions more tightly. “For,” says he, “there are passages of Scripture which
are in opposition to those who ignorantly suppose that they are able to destroy the liberty
of the will, or the possibility of not sinning, by the authority of Scripture. For,” he adds,
“they are in the habit of quoting against us what holy Job said: ‘Who is pure from uncleanness?
Not one; even if he be an infant of only one day upon the earth.’”1462 Then he proceeds
to give a sort of answer to this passage by help of other quotations; as when Job himself said:
“For although I am a righteous and blameless man, I have become a subject for mockery,”
1463—not understanding that a man may be called righteous, who has gone so far towards
perfection in righteousness as to be very near it; and this we do not deny to have been
in the power of many even in this life, when they walk in it by faith.</p>

<pb n="526"/>
<p>(24.) To Be Without Sin, and to Be Without Blame—How Differing.</p>
<p>The same thing is affirmed in another passage, which he has quoted immediately afterwards,
as spoken by the same Job: “Behold, I am very near my judgment, and I know that
I shall be found righteous.”1464 Now this is the judgment of which it is said in another
scripture: “And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the
noonday.” But he does not say, I am already there; but, “I am very near.” If, indeed, the
judgment of his which he meant was not that which he would himself exercise, but that
whereby he was to be judged at the last day, then in such judgment all will be found righteous
who with sincerity pray: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”1465 For it is
through this forgiveness that they will be found righteous; on this account that whatever
sins they have here incurred, they have blotted out by their deeds of charity. Whence the
Lord says: “Give alms; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.”1466 For in the end, it shall
be said to the righteous, when about to enter into the promised kingdom: “I was an hungered,
and ye gave me meat,”1467 and so forth. However, it is one thing to be without sin, which
in this life can only be predicated of the Only-begotten, and another thing to be without
accusation, which might be said of many just persons even in the present life; for there is a
certain measure of a good life, according to which even in this human intercourse there
could no just accusation be possibly laid against him. For who can justly accuse the man
who wishes evil to no one, and who faithfully does good to all he can, and never cherishes
a wish to avenge himself on any man who does him wrong, so that he can truly say, “As we
forgive our debtors?” And yet by the very fact that he truly says, “Forgive, as we also forgive,”
he plainly admits that he is not without sin.</p>

<p>(25.) Hence the force of the statement: “There was no injustice in my hands, but my
prayer was pure.”1468 For the purity of his prayer arose from this circumstance, that it was
not improper for him to ask forgiveness in prayer, when he really bestowed forgiveness
himself.</p>

<p>(26.) Why Job Was So Great a Sufferer.</p>
<p>And when he says concerning the Lord, “For many bruises hath He inflicted upon me
without a cause,”1469 observe that his words are not, He hath inflicted none with a cause;
but, “many without a cause.” For it was not because of his manifold sins that these many
bruises were inflicted on him, but in order to make trial of his patience. For on account of
his sins, indeed, without which, as he acknowledges in another passage, he was certainly
not, he yet judges that he ought to have suffered less.1470</p>

<p>(27.) Who May Be Said to Keep the Ways of the Lord; What It is to Decline and
Depart from the Ways of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then again, as for what he says, “For I have kept His ways, and have not turned aside
from His commandments, nor will I depart from them;”1471 he has kept God’s ways who
does not so turn aside as to forsake them, but makes progress by running his course therein;
although, weak as he is, he sometimes stumbles or falls, onward, however, he still goes, sinning
less and less until he reaches the perfect state in which he will sin no more. For in no
other way could he make progress, except by keeping His ways. The man, indeed, who declines
from these and becomes an apostate at last, is certainly not he who, although he has
sin, yet never ceases to persevere in fighting against it until he arrives at the home where
there shall remain no more conflict with death. Well now, it is in our present struggle
therewith that we are clothed with the righteousness in which we here live by faith,—clothed
with it as it were with a breastplate.1472 Judgment also we take on ourselves; and even when
it is against us, we turn it round to our own behalf; for we become our own accusers and
condemn our sins: whence that scripture which says, “The righteous man accuses himself
at the beginning of his speech.”1473 Hence also he says: “I put on righteousness, and clothed
myself with judgment like a mantle.”1474 Our vesture at present no doubt is wont to be armour
for war rather than garments of peace, while concupiscence has still to be subdued;
it will be different by and by, when our last enemy death shall be destroyed,1475 and our
righteousness shall be full and complete, without an enemy to molest us more.</p>

<p>(28.) When Our Heart May Be Said Not to Reproach Us; When Good is to Be Perfected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concerning these words of Job, “My heart shall not reproach me in all my
life,”1476 we remark, that it is in this present life of ours, in which we live by faith, that our
heart does not reproach us, if the same faith whereby we believe unto righteousness does
not neglect to rebuke our sin. On this principle the apostle says: “The good that I would I
do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.”1477 Now it is a good thing to avoid concupiscence,
and this good the just man would, who lives by faith;1478 and still he does what
he hates, because he has concupiscence, although “he goes not after his lusts;”1479 if he has
done this, he has himself at that time really done it, so as to yield to, and acquiesce in, and
obey the desire of sin. His heart then reproaches him, because it reproaches himself, and
not his sin which dwelleth in him. But whensoever he suffers not sin to reign in his mortal
body to obey it in the lusts thereof,1480 and yields not his members as instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin,1481 sin no doubt is present in his members, but it does not reign,
because its desires are not obeyed. Therefore, while he does that which he would not,—in
other words, while he wishes not to lust, but still lusts,—he consents to the law that it is
good:1482 for what the law would, that he also wishes; because it is his desire not to indulge
concupiscence, and the law expressly says, “Thou shalt not covet.”1483 Now in that he wishes
what the law also would have done, he no doubt consents to the law: but still he lusts, because
he is not without sin; it is, however, no longer himself that does the thing, but the sin which
dwells within him. Hence it is that “his heart does not reproach him in all his life;” that is,
in his faith, because the just man lives by faith, so that his faith is his very life. He knows, to
be sure, that in himself dwells nothing good,—even in his flesh, which is the dwelling-place
of sin. By not consenting, however, to it, he lives by faith, wherewith he also calls upon God
to help him in his contest against sin. Moreover, there is present to him to will that no sin
at all should be in him, but then how to perfect this good is not present. It is not the mere
“doing” of a good thing that is not present to him, but the “perfecting” of it. For in this, that
he yields no consent, he does good; he does good again, in this, that he hates his own lust;

<pb n="531"/>
he does good also, in this, that he does not cease to give alms; and in this, that he forgives
the man who sins against him, he does good; and in this, that he asks forgiveness for his
own trespasses,—sincerely avowing in his petition that he also forgives those who trespass
against himself, and praying that he may not be led into temptation, but be delivered from
evil,—he does good. But how to perfect the good is not present to him; it will be, however,
in that final state, when the concupiscence which dwells in his members shall exist no more.
His heart, therefore, does not reproach him, when it reproaches the sin which dwells in his
members; nor can it reproach unbelief in him. Thus “in all his life,”—that is, in his faith,—he
is neither reproached by his own heart, nor convinced of not being without sin. And Job
himself acknowledges this concerning himself, when he says, “Not one of my sins hath escaped
Thee; Thou hast sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and marked if I have done
iniquity unawares.”1484 With regard, then, to the passages which he has adduced from the
book of holy Job, we have shown to the best of our ability in what sense they ought to be
taken. He, however, has failed to explain the meaning of the words which he has himself
quoted from the same Job: “Who then is pure from uncleanness? Not one; even if he be an
infant of only one day upon the earth.”1485</p>

<p>(29.) The Second Passage. Who May Be Said to Abstain from Every
Evil Thing.</p>
<p>“They are in the habit of next quoting,” says he, “the passage: ‘Every man is a liar.’”1486
But here again he offers no solution of words which are quoted against himself even by
himself; all he does is to mention other apparently opposite passages before persons who
are unacquainted with the sacred Scriptures, and thus to cast the word of God into conflict.
This is what he says: “We tell them in answer, how in the book of Numbers it is said, ‘Man
is true.’1487 While of holy Job this eulogy is read: ‘There was a certain man in the land of
Ausis, whose name was Job; that man was true, blameless, righteous, and godly, abstaining
from every evil thing.’”1488 I am surprised that he has brought forward this passage, which
says that Job “abstained from every evil thing,” wishing it to mean “abstained from every
sin;” because he has argued already1489 that sin is not a thing, but an act. Let him recollect
that, even if it is an act, it may still be called a thing. That man, however, abstains from every
evil thing, who either never consents to the sin, which is always with him, or, if sometimes
hard pressed by it, is never oppressed by it; just as the wrestling champion, who, although
he is sometimes caught in a fierce grapple, does not for all that lose the prowess which
constitutes him the better man. We read, indeed, of a man without blame, of one without
accusation; but we never read of one without sin, except the Son of man, who is also the
only-begotten Son of God.</p>

<note type="footnote">1487 If this refer to Num. xxiv. 3, 15 (as the editions mark it), the quotation is most inexact. The Septuagint

“omnis homo mendax.”</note>

<p>(30.) “Every Man is a Liar,” Owing to Himself Alone; But “Every Man is True,” By
Help Only of the Grace of God.</p>
<p>“Moreover,” says he, “in Job himself it is said: ‘And he maintained the miracle of a true
man.’1490 Again we read in Solomon, touching wisdom: ‘Men that are liars cannot remember
her, but men of truth shall be found in her.’1491 Again in the Apocalypse: ‘And in their
mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault.’”1492 To all these statements we reply
with a reminder to our opponents, of how a man may be called true, through the grace and
truth of God, who is in himself without doubt a liar. Whence it is said: “Every man is a liar.”
1493 As for the passage also which he has quoted in reference to Wisdom, when it is said,
“Men of truth shall be found in her,” we must observe that it is undoubtedly not “in her,”
but in themselves that men shall be found liars. Just as in another passage: “Ye were sometimes
darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord,”1494—when he said, “Ye were darkness,” he did
not add, “in the Lord;” but after saying, “Ye are now light,” he expressly added the phrase,
“in the Lord,” for they could not possibly be “light” in themselves; in order that “he who
glorieth may glory in the Lord.”1495 The “faultless” ones, indeed, in the Apocalypse, are so
called because “no guile was found in their mouth.”1496 They did not say they had no sin:
if they had said this, they would deceive themselves, and the truth would not be in them;1497
and if the truth were not in them, guile and untruth would be found in their mouth. If,
however, to avoid envy, they said they were not without sin, although they were sinless, then
this very insincerity would be a lie, and the character given of them would be untrue: “In
their mouth was found no guile.” Hence indeed “they are without fault;” for as they have
forgiven those who have done them wrong, so are they purified by God’s forgiveness of
themselves. Observe now how we have to the best of our power explained in what sense the
quotations he has in his own behalf advanced ought to be understood. But how the passage,
“Every man is a liar,” is to be interpreted, he on his part has altogether omitted to explain;
nor is an explanation within his power, without a correction of the error which makes him
believe that man can be true without the help of God’s grace, and merely by virtue of his
own free will.</p>

<p>(31.) The Third Passage. It is One Thing to Depart, and Another
Thing to Have Departed, from All Sin. “There is None that Doeth Good,”—Of
Whom This is to Be Understood.</p>
<p>He has likewise propounded another question, as we shall proceed to show, but has
failed to solve it; nay, he has rather rendered it more difficult, by first stating the testimony
that had been quoted against him: “There is none that doeth good, no, not one;”1498 and
then resorting to seemingly contrary passages to show that there are persons who do good.
This he succeeded, no doubt, in doing. It is, however, one thing for a man not to do good,
and another thing not to be without sin, although he at the same time may do many good
things. The passages, therefore, which he adduces are not really contrary to the statement
that no person is without sin in this life. He does not, for his own part, explain in what sense
it is declared that “there is none that doeth good, no, not one.” These are his words: “Holy
David indeed says, ‘Hope thou in the Lord and be doing good.’”1499 But this is a precept,
and not an accomplished fact; and such a precept as is never kept by those of whom it is
said, “There is none that doeth good, no, not one.” He adds: “Holy Tobit also said, ‘Fear
not, my son, that we have to endure poverty; we shall have many blessings if we fear God,
and depart from all sin, and do that which is good.’”1500 Most true indeed it is, that man
shall have many blessings when he shall have departed from all sin. Then no evil shall betide
him; nor shall he have need of the prayer, “Deliver us from evil.”1501 Although even now
every man who progresses, advancing ever with an upright purpose, departs from all sin,
and becomes further removed from it as he approaches nearer to the fulness and perfection
of the righteous state; because even concupiscence itself, which is sin dwelling in our flesh,
never ceases to diminish in those who are making progress, although it still remains in their
mortal members. It is one thing, therefore, to depart from all sin,—a process which is even
now in operation,—and another thing to have departed from all sin, which shall happen in
the state of future perfection. But still, even he who has departed already from evil, and is
continuing to do so, must be allowed to be a doer of good. How then is it said, in the passage
which he has quoted and left unsolved, “There is none that doeth good, no, not one,” unless
that the Psalmist there censures some one nation, amongst whom there was not a man that
did good, wishing to remain “children of men,” and not sons of God, by whose grace man
becomes good, in order to do good? For we must suppose the Psalmist here to mean that
“good” which he describes in the context, saying, “God looked down from heaven upon the

children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.”1502 Such good
then as this, seeking after God, there was not a man found who pursued it, no, not one; but
this was in that class of men which is predestinated to destruction.1503 It was upon such
that God looked down in His foreknowledge, and passed sentence.</p>

than in regard to their punishment, not their sin: not to the evil which they unrighteously commit, but to the
punishment which they shall righteously suffer; not to the sin on account of which they either do not receive,
or else lose, the benefit of the first resurrection, but to the retribution which their own personal iniquity evilly
incurs, and the divine justice righteously inflicts.”</note>

<p>(32.) The Fourth Passage. In What Sense God Only is Good. With
God to Be Good and to Be Himself are the Same Thing.</p>
<p>“They likewise,” says he, “quote what the Saviour says: ‘Why callest thou me good?
There is none good save one, that is, God?’”1504 This statement, however, he makes no attempt
whatever to explain; all he does is to oppose to it sundry other passages which seem
to contradict it, which he adduces to show that man, too, is good. Here are his remarks:
“We must answer this text with another, in which the same Lord says, ‘A good man out of
the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.’1505 And again: ‘He maketh His
sun to rise on the good and on the evil.’1506 Then in another passage it is written, ‘For the
good things are created from the beginning;’1507 and yet again, ‘They that are good shall
dwell in the land.’”1508 Now to all this we must say in answer, that the passages in question
must be understood in the same sense as the former one, “There is none good, save one,
that is, God.” Either because all created things, although God made them very good, are yet,
when compared with their Creator, not good, being in fact incapable of any comparison
with Him. For in a transcendent, and yet very proper sense, He said of Himself, “I Am that
I Am.”1509 The statement therefore before us, “None is good save one, that is, God,” is used
in some such way as that which is said of John, “He was not that light;”1510 although the
Lord calls him “a lamp,”1511 just as He says to His disciples: “Ye are the light of the world:
. . .neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel.”1512 Still, in comparison with that
light which is “the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,”1513 he
was not light. Or else, because the very sons of God even, when compared with themselves
as they shall hereafter become in their eternal perfection, are good in such a way that they
still remain also evil. Although I should not have dared to say this of them (for who would
be so bold as to call them evil who have God for their Father?) unless the Lord had Himself
said: “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more

shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?”1514 Of course,
by applying to them the words, “your Father,” He proved that they were already sons of
God; and yet at the same time He did not hesitate to say that they were “evil.” Your author,
however, does not explain to us how they are good, whilst yet “there is none good save one,
that is, God.” Accordingly the man who asked “what good thing he was to do,”1515 was admonished
to seek Him1516 by whose grace he might be good; to whom also to be good is
nothing else than to be Himself, because He is unchangeably good, and cannot be evil at all.</p>

himself must be taken, so as to prevent Holy Scripture seeming to be opposed to itself in
this text, and in the passages by which he makes his answer. We for our part indeed tell him,
in answer, that the clause, “Who will boast that he has a pure heart?” is a suitable sequel to
the preceding sentence, “whenever a righteous king sits upon the throne.”1519 For how great
soever ever a man’s righteousness may be, he ought to reflect and think, lest there should
be found something blameworthy, which has escaped indeed his own notice, when that
righteous King shall sit upon His throne, whose cognizance no sins can possibly escape, not
even those of which it is said, “Who understandeth his transgressions?”1520 “When, therefore,
the righteous King shall sit upon His throne, . . . who will boast that he has a pure heart? or
who will boldly say that he is pure from sin?”1521 Except perhaps those who wish to boast
of their own righteousness, and not glory in the mercy of the Judge Himself.</p>

<p>(34.) The Opposing Passages.</p>
<p>And yet the passages are true which he goes on to adduce by way of answer, saying:
“The Saviour in the gospel declares, ‘Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.’1522
David also says, ‘Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy
place? He that is innocent in his hands, and pure in his heart;’1523 and again in another
passage, ‘Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good and upright in heart.’1524 So also in
Solomon: ‘Riches are good unto him that hath no sin on his conscience;’1525 and again in
the same book, ‘Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from
wickedness.’1526 So in the Epistle of John, ‘If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God; and whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.’”1527 For all this is
accomplished by the will, by the exercise of faith, hope, and love; by keeping under the body;
by doing alms; by forgiving injuries; by earnest prayer; by supplicating for strength to advance
in our course; by sincerely saying, “Forgive us, as we also forgive others,” and “Lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”1528 By this process, it is certainly brought about
that our heart is cleansed, and all our sin taken away; and what the righteous King, when
sitting on His throne, shall find concealed in the heart and uncleansed as yet, shall be remitted
by His mercy, so that the whole shall be rendered sound and cleansed for seeing God. For
“he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy: yet mercy triumpheth
against judgment.”1529 If it were not so, what hope could any of us have? “When, indeed,
the righteous King shall sit upon His throne, who shall boast that he hath a pure heart, or
who shall boldly say that he is pure from sin?” Then, however, through His mercy shall the
righteous, being by that time fully and perfectly cleansed, shine forth like the glorious sun
in the kingdom of their Father.1530</p>

<p>(35.) The Church Will Be Without Spot and Wrinkle After the Resurrection.</p>
<p>Then shall the Church realize, fully and perfectly, the condition of “not having spot, or
wrinkle, or any such thing,”1531 because then also will it in a real sense be glorious. For
inasmuch as he added the epithet “glorious,” when he said, “That He might present the
Church to Himself, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,” he signified sufficiently
when the Church will be without spot, or wrinkle, or anything of this kind,—then of course
when it shall be glorious. Because it is not so much when the Church is involved in so many
evils, or amidst such offences, and in so great a mixture of very evil men, and amidst the
heavy reproaches of the ungodly, that we ought to say that it is glorious, because kings serve
it,—a fact which only produces a more perilous and a sorer temptation;—but then shall it
rather be glorious, when that event shall come to pass of which the apostle also speaks in
the words, “When Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him
in glory.”1532 For since the Lord Himself, in that form of a servant by which He united
Himself as Mediator to the Church, was not glorified except by the glory of His resurrection
(whence it is said, “The Spirit was not yet given, because Christ was not yet glorified”1533),
how shall His Church be described as glorious, before its resurrection? He cleanses it,
therefore, now “by the laver of the water in the word,”1534 washing away its past sins, and
driving off from it the dominion of wicked angels; but then by bringing all its healthy powers
to perfection, He makes it meet for that glorious state, where it shall shine without a spot
or wrinkle. For “whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them
He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.”1535 It was under this
mystery, as I suppose, that that was spoken, “Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day
and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be consummated,” or perfected.1536 For He said
this in the person of His body, which is His Church, putting days for distinct and appointed
periods, which He also signified in “the third day” in His resurrection.</p>

<p>(36.) The Difference Between the Upright in Heart and the Clean in Heart.</p>
<p>I suppose, too, that there is a difference between one who is upright in heart and one
who is clean in heart. A man is upright in heart when he “reaches forward to those things
which are before, forgetting those things which are behind”1537 so as to arrive in a right
course, that is, with right faith and purpose, at the perfection where he may dwell clean and
pure in heart. Thus, in the psalm, the conditions ought to be severally bestowed on each
separate character, where it is said, “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall
stand in His holy place? He that is innocent in his hands, and clean in his heart.”1538 He
shall ascend, innocent in his hands, and stand, clean in his heart,—the one state in present
operation, the other in its consummation. And of them should rather be understood that
which is written: “Riches are good unto him that hath no sin on his conscience.”1539 Then
indeed shall accrue the good, or true riches, when all poverty shall have passed away; in
other words, when all infirmity shall have been removed. A man may now indeed “leave off
from sin,” when in his onward course he departs from it, and is renewed day by day; and
he may “order his hands,” and direct them to works of mercy, and “cleanse his heart from
all wickedness,”1540—he may be so merciful that what remains may be forgiven him by free
pardon. This indeed is the sound and suitable meaning, without any vain and empty
boasting, of that which St. John said: “If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.”1541 The warning which he
clearly has addressed to us in this passage, is to beware lest our heart should reproach us in
our very prayers and petitions; that is to say, lest, when we happen to resort to this prayer,
and say, “Forgive us, even as we ourselves forgive, we should have to feel compunction for
not doing what we say, or should even lose boldness to utter what we fail to do, and thereby
forfeit the confidence of faithful and earnest prayer.</p>

<p>(37.) The Sixth Passage.</p>
<p>He has also adduced this passage of Scripture, which is very commonly quoted against
his party: “For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.”1542
And he makes a pretence of answering it by other passages,—how, “the Lord says concerning
holy Job, ‘Hast thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him upon earth, a
man who is blameless, true, a worshipper of God, and abstaining from every evil thing.’”1543
On this passage we have already made some remarks.1544 But he has not even attempted to
show us how, on the one hand, Job was absolutely sinless upon earth,—if the words are to
bear such a sense; and, on the other hand, how that can be true which he has admitted to
be in the Scripture, “There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth
not.”1545</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—(38.) The Seventh Passage. Who May Be Called Immaculate. How
It is that in God’s Sight No Man is Justified.</head>
<p>“They also, says he, “quote the text: ‘For in thy sight shall no man living be justified.’”1546
And his affected answer to this passage amounts to nothing else than the showing how texts
of Holy Scripture seem to clash with one another, whereas it is our duty rather to demonstrate
their agreement. These are his words: “We must confront them with this answer, from the
testimony of the evangelist concerning holy Zacharias and Elisabeth, when he says, ‘And
they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of
the Lord blameless.’” 1547 Now both these righteous persons had, of course, read amongst
these very commandments the method of cleansing their own sins. For, according to what
is said in the Epistle to the Hebrews of “every high priest taken from among men,”1548
Zacharias used no doubt to offer sacrifices even for his own sins. The meaning, however,
of the phrase “blameless,” which is applied to him, we have already, as I suppose, sufficiently
explained.1549 “And,” he adds, “the blessed apostle says, ‘That we should be holy, and without
blame before Him.’”1550 This, according to him, is said that we should be so, if those persons
are to be understood by “blameless” who are altogether without sin. If, however, they are
“blameless” who are without blame or censure, then it is impossible for us to deny that there
have been, and still are, such persons even in this present life; for it does not follow that a
man is without sin because he has not a blot of accusation. Accordingly the apostle, when
selecting ministers for ordination, does not say, “If any be sinless,” for he would be unable
to find any such; but he says, “If any be without accusation,”1551 for such, of course, he
would be able to find. But our opponent does not tell us how, in accordance with his views,
we ought to understand the scripture, “For in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.”1552
The meaning of these words is plain enough, receiving as it does additional light from the
preceding clause: “Enter not,” says the Psalmist, “into judgment with Thy servant, for in
Thy sight shall no man living be justified.” It is judgment which he fears, therefore he desires
that mercy which triumphs over judgment.1553 For the meaning of the prayer, “Enter not
into judgment with Thy servant,” is this: “Judge me not according to Thyself,” who art

to that perfect state of righteousness which belongs not to this life.</p>

<p>(39.) The Eighth Passage. In What Sense He is Said Not to Sin Who
is Born of God. In What Way He Who Sins Shall Not See Nor Know God.</p>
<p>“They also quote,” says he, “this passage, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”1554 And this very clear testimony he has endeavoured
to meet with apparently contradictory texts, saying thus: “The same St. John in this very
epistle says, ‘This, however, brethren, I say, that ye sin not. Whosoever is born of God doth
not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin.’1555 Also elsewhere:
‘Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; because his being born of God preserveth him, and
the evil one toucheth him not.’1556 And again in another passage, when speaking of the Saviour,
he says: ‘Since He was manifested to take away sins, whosoever abideth in Him sinneth
not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him.’1557 And yet again: ‘Beloved,
now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man
that hath this hope towards Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.’”1558 And yet, notwithstanding
the truth of all these passages, that also is true which he has adduced, without,
however, offering any explanation of it: “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.”1559 Now it follows from the whole of this, that in so far as we are
born of God we abide in Him who appeared to take away sins, that is, in Christ, and sin
not,—which is simply that “the inward man is renewed day by day;”1560 but in so far as we
are born of that man “through whom sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so
death passed upon all men,”1561 we are not without sin, because we are not as yet free from
his infirmity, until, by that renewal which takes place from day to day (for it is in accordance
with this that we were born of God), that infirmity shall be wholly repaired, wherein we
were born from the first than, and in which we are not without sin. While the remains of
this infirmity abide in our inward man, however much they may be daily lessened in those
who are advancing, “we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, if we say that we have
no sin.” Now, however true it is that “whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, nor known
Him,”1562 since with that vision and knowledge, which shall be realized in actual sight, no

one can in this life see and know Him; yet with that vision and knowledge which come of
faith, there may be many who commit sin,—even apostates themselves,—who still have
believed in Him some time or other; so that of none of these could it be said, according to
the vision and knowledge which as yet come of faith, that he has neither seen Him nor
known Him. But I suppose it ought to be understood that it is the renewal which awaits
perfection that sees and knows Him; whereas the infirmity which is destined to waste and
ruin neither sees nor knows Him. And it is owing to the remains of this infirmity, of whatever
amount, which remain firm in our inward man, that “we deceive ourselves, and have not
the truth in us, when we say that we have no sin.” Although, then, by the grace of renovation
“we are the sons of God,” yet by reason of the remains of infirmity within us “it doth not
appear what we shall be; only we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for
we shall see Him as He is.” Then there shall be no more sin, because no infirmity shall any
longer remain within us or without us. “And every man that hath this hope towards Him
purifieth himself, even as He is pure,”—purifieth himself, not indeed by himself alone, but
by believing in Him, and calling on Him who sanctifieth His saints; which sanctification,
when perfected at last (for it is at present only advancing and growing day by day), shall
take away from us for ever all the remains of our infirmity.</p>

<p>(40.) The Ninth Passage.</p>
<p>“This passage, too,” says he, “is quoted by them: ‘It is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.’”1563 And he observes that the answer to be
given to them is derived from the same apostle’s words in another passage: “Let him do
what he will.”1564 And he adds another passage from the Epistle to Philemon, where,
speaking of Onesimus, [St. Paul says]: “‘Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy
stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel. But without thy mind
would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.’1565
Likewise, in Deuteronomy: ‘Life and death hath He set before thee, and good and evil: . .
.choose thou life, that thou mayest live.’1566 So in the book of Solomon: ‘God from the beginning
made man, and left him in the hand of His counsel; and He added for him commandments
and precepts: if thou wilt—to perform acceptable faithfulness for the time to
come, they shall save thee. He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thine hand
unto whether thou wilt. Before man are good and evil, and life and death; poverty and
honour are from the Lord God.’1567 So again in Isaiah we read: ‘If ye be willing, and hearken
unto me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye be not willing, and hearken not to me,
the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.’”1568 Now with all
their efforts of disguise they here betray their purpose; for they plainly attempt to controvert
the grace and mercy of God, which we desire to obtain whenever we offer the prayer, “Thy
will be done in earth as it is in heaven;”1569 or again this, “Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil.”1570 For indeed why do we present such petitions in earnest supplication,
if the result is of him that willeth, and him that runneth, but not of God that showeth mercy?
Not that the result is without our will, but that our will does not accomplish the result, unless
it receive the divine assistance. Now the wholesomeness of faith is this, that it makes us
“seek, that we may find; ask, that we may receive; and knock, that it may be opened to
us.”1571 Whereas the man who gainsays it, does really shut the door of God’s mercy against

<p>(41.) Specimens of Pelagian Exegesis.</p>
<p>But I beg of you to see what kind of objection, after all, he makes, that to him who
“willeth and runneth” there is no necessity for God’s mercy, which actually anticipates him
in order that he may run,—because, forsooth, the apostle says concerning a certain person,
“Let him do what he will,”1572—in the matter, as I suppose, which he goes on to treat, when
he says, “He sinneth not, let him marry!”1573 As if indeed it should be regarded as a great
matter to be willing to marry, when the subject is a laboured discussion concerning the as-
sistance of God’s grace, or that it is of any great advantage to will it, unless God’s providence,
which governs all things, joins together the man and the woman. Or, in the case of the
apostle’s writing to Philemon, that “his kindness should not be as it were of necessity, but
voluntary,”—as if any good act could indeed be voluntary otherwise than by God’s “working
in us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.”1574 Or, when the Scripture says in
Deuteronomy, “Life and death hath He set before man and good and evil,” and admonishes
him “to choose life;” as if, forsooth, this very admonition did not come from God’s mercy,
or as if there were any advantage in choosing life, unless God inspired love to make such a
choice, and gave the possession of it when chosen, concerning which it is said: “For anger
is in His indignation, and in His pleasure is life.”1575</p>
<p>Or again, because it is said, “The commandments, if thou wilt, shall save thee,”1576—as
if a man ought not to thank God, because he has a will to keep the commandments, since,
if he wholly lacked the light of truth, it would not be possible for him to possess such a will.
“Fire and water being set before him, a man stretches forth his hand towards which he
pleases;”1577 and yet higher is He who calls man to his higher vocation than any thought
on man’s own part, inasmuch as the beginning of correction of the heart lies in faith, even
as it is written, “Thou shalt come, and pass on from the beginning of faith.”1578 Every one
makes his choice of good, “according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of
faith;”1579 and as the Prince of faith says, “No man can come to me, except the Father which
hath sent me draw him.”1580 And that He spake this in reference to the faith which believes

I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life; yet there are some of you that believe not.

Him. And He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were

<p>(42.) God’s Promises Conditional. Saints of the Old Testament Were Saved by the
Grace of Christ.</p>
<p>He, however, thought he had discovered a great support for his cause in the prophet
Isaiah; because by him God said: “If ye be willing, and hearken unto me, ye shall eat the
good of the land; but if ye be not willing, and hearken not to me, the sword shall devour
you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.”1582 As if the entire law were not full of
conditions of this sort; or as if its commandments had been given to proud men for any
other reason than that “the law was added because of transgression, until the seed should
come to whom the promise was made.”1583 “It entered, therefore, that the offence might
abound; but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.”1584 In other words, That
man might receive commandments, trusting as he did in his own resources, and that, failing
in these and becoming a transgressor, he might ask for a deliverer and a saviour; and that
the fear of the law might humble him, and bring him, as a schoolmaster, to faith and grace.
Thus “their weaknesses being multiplied, they hastened after;”1585 and in order to heal them,
Christ in due season came. In His grace even righteous men of old believed, and by the same
grace were they holpen; so that with joy did they receive a foreknowledge of Him, and some
of them even foretold His coming,—whether they were found among the people of Israel
themselves, as Moses, and Joshua the son of Nun, and Samuel, and David, and other such;
or outside that people, as Job; or previous to that people, as Abraham, and Noah, and all
others who are either mentioned or not in Holy Scripture. “For there is but one God, and
one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus,”1586 without whose grace nobody
is delivered from condemnation, whether he has derived that condemnation from him in
whom all men sinned, or has afterwards aggravated it by his own iniquities.</p>

<p>(43.) No Man is Assisted Unless He Does Himself Also Work. Our
Course is a Constant Progress.</p>
<p>But what is the import of the last statement which he has made: “If any one say, ‘May
it possibly be that a man sin not even in word?’ then the answer,” says he, “which must be
given is, ‘Quite possible, if God so will; and God does so will, therefore it is possible.’” See
how unwilling he was to say, “If God give His help, then it would be possible;” and yet the
Psalmist thus addresses God: “Be Thou my helper, forsake me not;”1587 where of course
help is not sought for procuring bodily advantages and avoiding bodily evils, but for practising
and fulfilling righteousness. Hence it is that we say: “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil.”1588 Now no man is assisted unless he also himself does something; assisted,
however, he is, if he prays, if he believes, if he is “called according to God’s purpose;”1589
for “whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His
Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate,
them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He
justified, them He also glorified.”1590 We run, therefore, whenever we make advance; and
our wholeness runs with us in our advance (just as a sore is said to run1591 when the wound
is in process of a sound and careful treatment), in order that we may be in every respect
perfect, without any infirmity of sin whatever,—a result which God not only wishes, but
even causes and helps us to accomplish. And this God’s grace does, in co-operation with
ourselves, through Jesus Christ our Lord, as well by commandments, sacraments, and examples,
as by His Holy Spirit also; through whom there is hiddenly shed abroad in our hearts
1592 that love, “which maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
uttered,”1593 until wholeness and salvation be perfected in us, and God be manifested to us
as He will be seen in His eternal truth.</p>

<p>(44.) Conclusion of the Work. In the Regenerate It is Not Concupiscence,
But Consent, Which is Sin.</p>
<p>Whosoever, then, supposes that any man or any men (except the one Mediator between
God and man1594) have ever lived, or are yet living in this present state, who have not needed,
and do not need, forgiveness of sins, he opposes Holy Scripture, wherein it is said by the
apostle: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon
all men, in which all have sinned.”1595 And he must needs go on to assert, with an impious
contention, that there may possibly be men who are freed and saved from sin without the
liberation and salvation of the one Mediator Christ. Whereas He it is who has said: “They
that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick;”1596 “I am not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.”1597 He, moreover, who says that any man, after he
has received remission of sins, has ever lived in this body, or still is living, so righteously as
to have no sin at all, he contradicts the Apostle John, who declares that “If we say we have
no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”1598 Observe, the expression is not
we had, but “we have.” If, however, anybody contend that the apostle’s statement concerns
the sin which dwells in our mortal flesh according to the defect which was caused by the
will of the first man when he sinned, and concerning which the Apostle Paul enjoins us
“not” to “obey it in the lusts thereof,1599—so that he does not sin who altogether withholds
his consent from this same indwelling sin, and so brings it to no evil work,—either in deed,
or word, or thought,—although the lusting after it may be excited (which in another sense
has received the name of sin, inasmuch as consenting to it would amount to sinning), but
excited against our will,—he certainly is drawing subtle distinctions, and should consider
what relation all this bears to the Lord’s Prayer, wherein we say, “Forgive us our debts.”1600
Now, if I judge aright, it would be unnecessary to put up such a prayer as this, if we never
in the least degree consented to the lusts of the before-mentioned sin, either in a slip of the
tongue, or in a wanton thought; all that it would be needful to say would be, “Lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”1601 Nor could the Apostle James say: “In many
things we all offend.”1602 For in truth only that man offends whom an evil concupiscence

persuades, either by deception or by force, to do or say or think something which he ought
to avoid, by directing his appetites or his aversions contrary to the rule of righteousness.
Finally, if it be asserted that there either have been, or are in this present life, any persons,
with the sole exception of our Great Head, “the Saviour of His body,”1603 who are righteous,
without any sin,—and this, either by not consenting to the lusts thereof, or because that
must not be accounted as any sin which is such that God does not impute it to them by
reason of their godly lives (although the blessedness of being without sin is a different thing
from the blessedness of not having one’s sin imputed to him),1604—I do not deem it necessary
to contest the point over much. I am quite aware that some hold this opinion,1605 whose
views on the subject I have not the courage to censure, although, at the same time, I cannot
defend them. But if any man says that we ought not to use the prayer, “Lead us not into
temptation” (and he says as much who maintains that God’s help is unnecessary to a person
for the avoidance of sin, and that human will, after accepting only the law, is sufficient for
the purpose), then I do not hesitate at once to affirm that such a man ought to be removed
from the public ear, and to be anathematized by every mouth.</p>

<head>A WORK ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF PELAGIUS.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">   
<pb n="556"/>
<head>EXTRACT FROM AUGUSTIN’S “RETRACTATIONS,”  
Book II. Chap. 45,</head>
<p>ON THE FOLLOWING TREATISE,
“DE GESTIS PELAGII.”</p>
<p>“About the same time, in the East (that is to say, in Palestinian Syria), Pelagius was
summoned by certain catholic brethren1606 before a tribunal of bishops, and was heard on
his trial by fourteen prelates, in the absence of his accusers, who were unable to be present
on the day of the synod. On his condemning the very dogmas which were read from the
indictment against him, as assailing the grace of Christ, they pronounced him to be a catholic.
But when the Acts of this synod found their way into our hands, I wrote a treatise on
them, to prevent the idea gaining ground that, because he had been in a manner acquitted,
his opinions also were approved by the bishops; or that the accused could by any chance
have escaped condemnation at their hands, unless he had condemned the opinions charged
against him. This treatise of mine begins with these words: ‘After there came into my hands.’”</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<pb n="557"/>
<head>PREFACE TO THE BOOK ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF PELAGIUS.</head>
<p>In the year of Christ 415, Pelagius was accused of heresy in Palestine, and brought to
trial on one or two occasions. At the first trial, which was held on or about the 30th of July,
at a congress of his presbyters, by John, bishop of Jerusalem, no regular record was kept of
the proceedings, as we are informed by Augustin in the following work (sec. 39 and 55).
The hour and the day of this assembly we may learn from Orosius, a presbyter of Spain,
who was present at the congress, and has in his Apology committed to writing some of its
most memorable acts. We are informed by him that “after a great deal of earnest proceeding
on both sides, the bishop John proposed the last resolution, that certain brethren should be
sent with a letter to blessed Innocent, Pope of Rome, to the intent that he might decide on
all the points which were to follow.”</p>
<p>The second trial took place afterwards at Diospolis,1607 a city in Palestine, before fourteen
bishops, at which was kept an accurate record of the proceedings. The bishops are severally
mentioned by Augustin in his work against Julianus, Book i. chs. v. and vii. (19, 32), in the
following order: “Eulogius, John, Ammonianus, Porphyry, Eutonius, another Porphyry,
Fidus, Zoninus, Zoboennus, Nymphidius, Chromatius, Jovinus, Eleutherius, and Clematius.”
There can be no doubt that Eulogius, bishop of Cæsarea, was also primate of the province
of Palestine, because he is constantly mentioned by Augustin as occupying the first place
before the other thirteen bishops, and even before John himself, bishop of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We find from the epistle of Lucian,1608 De revelatione corporis Stephani martyris, that
this synod was held at the approach of Christmas. In this epistle he tells us of three visions
which God had shown him in the year 415,—the first on December 3d, and the other two
on the 10th and 17th of the same month; that he then reported the matter to John, bishop
of Jerusalem, who sent him in quest of the martyr’s sepulchre. He further informs us that
he discovered the sepulchre, and at once returned to John, “who (says he) was attending a
synod at Lydda, which is Diospolis.” This must have happened about the 21st of the month,
since Lucian goes on to say that John came, in the company of two more bishops, Eutonius
of Sebaste and Eleutherius of Jericho, and that in their presence the relics of the martyr were
removed on the 26th day of the same month of December.</p>
<p>A certain deacon, called Annianus, is supposed to have pleaded the cause of Pelagius
at the synod; some learned men finding it easier to interpret of this deacon than of Pelagius
what Jerome writes in a letter addressed to Alypius and Augustin (Epist. Augustinian. 202,
<note type="footnote">1607 That is, Lydda.</note>
<note type="footnote">1608 To be found in Migne’s Patrologia Latina, vol. vii., Appendix.</note>

2): “For every thing which he denies having ever uttered in that miserable synod of
Diospolis he professes to hold in this work.” Jerome bestowed the epithet of “miserable” on
this synod of Diospolis, for no other reason (as we suppose) than because he discovered
from its Acts how miserably the synod had been duped by Pelagius. Pope Innocent, after a
sight of these Acts, expressly owned (see Epist. Augustinian. 183, 4) that “he could not bring
himself to refuse either blame or praise of those bishops.” Augustin, however, in the following
treatise (see chs. 4 and 8), does not hesitate to call them “pious judges,” and (in his first book
against Julianus, i. ch. v. 19) “catholic judges,” who, when Pelagius abjured the errors attributed
to him, pronounced him a catholic, and acquitted him; indeed, he frequently cites these
fourteen bishops as witnesses of the catholic faith in opposition to Julianus.</p>
<p>In his letters addressed to Pope Innocent in the year 416 (see Epist. Augustinian. 175,
4, and 177, 2), Augustin intimated that he knew nothing of the Proceedings of the synod
except from hearsay; and in a letter to John, bishop of Jerusalem (Epist. 179, 4), he earnestly
requested him to forward them to him. But the report was in his hands about midsummer
in 417, when he wrote his Epistle to Paulinus (Epist. 186, 31); so that the date of the following
treatise is thus traced to the commencement of the year 417, supposing it to have been
published immediately after he had received the Proceedings.</p>
<p>The title given to this work by Augustin, in his book On Original Sin (15), stands De
Gestis Palæstinis <del>On the Proceedings which took place in Palestine</del>; by this title Prosper
likewise refers to the work (in his book Adv. Collatorem, 43); but yet we ought to retain the
inscription De Gestis Pelagii which is prefixed both to the ancient editions and to the particular
Retractation in which Augustin reviewed this work. The treatise had this title given to
it, no doubt, either because it had been already commonly accepted as a description of these
proceedings of Pelagius and his vindication, which led to his boast that he had been acquitted;
or else from the fact that an examination had become necessary of those proceedings, which
the accused party had himself published in an abridged and garbled form. Hence Possidonius
named the treatise by the title, Contra Gesta Pelagii<del>A Protest, or Vindication, against the
Proceedings of Pelagius</del>.</p>
<p>Out of this book Photius copied a very accurate account of the Synod of Diospolis and
inserted it in his Bibliotheca (cod. 54). One may therefore conclude that this work of Augustin’s
is one of those which Possidonius, in his Life, ch. xi. or xxi., No. 59, mentions as
having been “translated into the Greek tongue.” The Aurelius to whom the work is dedicated
is mentioned by Photius in the passage just cited, and by Prosper before him (in the 43d
chapter of the above-quoted Adversus Collatorem), as “the bishop of Carthage.” If the titlepage
of old did not give them this information, they could both of them discover it from
reading this book, especially ch. 23 <del>XI.</del>.</p>

<head>A WORK ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF PELAGIUS, <del>1609</del>
In One Book,</head>
<p>ADDRESSED TO BISHOP AURELIUS [OF CARTHAGE], BY
AURELIUS AUGUSTIN;
written about the commencement of the year, a.d. 417.</p>
<p>The several heads of error which were alleged against Pelagius at the Synod in Palestine, with
his answers to each charge, are minutely discussed. Augustin shows that, although Pelagius
was acquitted by the synod, there still clave to him the suspicion of heresy; and that the
acquittal of the accused by the synod was so contrived, that the heresy itself with which
he was charged was unhesitatingly condemned.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>Introduction.</p>
<p>After there came into my hands, holy father Aurelius, the ecclesiastical proceedings, by
which fourteen bishops of the province of Palestine pronounced Pelagius a catholic, my
hesitation, in which I was previously reluctant to make any lengthy or confident statement
about the defence which he had made, came to an end. This defence, indeed, I had already
read in a paper which he himself forwarded to me. Forasmuch, however, as I received no
letter therewith from him, I was afraid that some discrepancy might be detected between
my statement and the record of the ecclesiastical proceedings; and that, should Pelagius
perhaps deny that he had sent me any paper (and it would have been difficult for me to
prove that he had, when there was only one witness), I should rather seem guilty in the eyes
of those who would readily credit his denial, either of an underhanded falsification, or else
(to say the least) of a reckless credulity. Now, however, when I am to treat of matters which
are shown to have actually transpired, and when, as it appears to me, all doubt is removed
whether he really acted in the way described, your holiness, and everybody who reads these
pages, will no doubt be able to judge, with greater readiness and certainty, both of his defence
and of this my treatment of it.</p>

<pb n="561"/>
<head>Chapter 2<del>I.</del></head>
<p>The First Item in the Accusation, and Pelagius’ Answer.</p>
<p>First of all, then, I offer to the Lord my God, who is also my defence and guide, unspeakable
thanks, because I was not misled in my views respecting our holy brethren and fellowbishops
who sat as judges in that case. His answers, indeed, they not without reason approved;
because they had not to consider how he had in his writings stated the points which were
objected against him, but what he had to say about them in his reply at the pending examination.
A case of unsoundness in the faith is one thing, one of incautious statement is another
thing. Now sundry objections were urged against Pelagius out of a written complaint,
which our holy brethren and fellow-bishops in Gaul, Heros and Lazarus, presented, being
themselves unable to be present, owing (as we afterwards learned from credible information)
to the severe indisposition of one of them. The first of these was, that he writes, in a certain
book of his, this: “No man can be without sin unless he has acquired a knowledge of the
law.” After this had been read out, the synod inquired: “Did you, Pelagius, express yourself
thus?” Then in answer he said: “I certainly used the words, but not in the sense in which
they understand them. I did not say that a man is unable to sin who has acquired a knowledge
of the law; but that he is by the knowledge of the law assisted towards not sinning, even as
it is written, ‘He hath given them a law for help’” 1609 Upon hearing this, the synod declared:
“The words which have been spoken by Pelagius are not different from the Church.” Assuredly
they are not different, as he expressed them in his answer; the statement, however,
which was produced from his book has a different meaning. But this the bishops, who were
Greek-speaking men, and who heard the words through an interpreter, were not concerned
with discussing. All they had to consider at the moment was, what the man who was under
examination said was his meaning,—not in what words his opinion was alleged to have been
expressed in his book.</p>
<note type="footnote">1609 Isa. viii. 20.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="562"/>
<head>Chapter 3.</head>
<p>Discussion of Pelagius’ First Answer.</p>
<p>Now to say that “a man is by the knowledge of the law assisted towards not sinning,” is
a different assertion from saying that “a man cannot be without sin unless he has acquired
a knowledge of the law.” We see, for example, that corn-floors may be threshed without
threshing-sledges,—however much these may assist the operation if we have them; and that
boys can find their way to school without the pedagogue,—however valuable for this may
be the office of pedagogues; and that many persons recover from sickness without physicians,—
although the doctor’s skill is clearly of greatest use; and that men sometimes live on
other aliments besides bread,—however valuable the use of bread must needs be allowed to
be; and many other illustrations may occur to the thoughtful reader, without our prompting.
From which examples we are undoubtedly reminded that there are two sorts of aids. Some
are indispensable, and without their help the desired result could not be attained. Without
a ship, for instance, no man could take a voyage; no man could speak without a voice; without
legs no man could walk; without light nobody could see; and so on in numberless instances.
Amongst them this also may be reckoned, that without God’s grace no man can live rightly.
But then, again, there are other helps, which render us assistance in such a way that we
might in some other way effect the object to which they are ordinarily auxiliary in their absence.
Such are those which I have already mentioned,—the threshing-sledges for threshing
corn, the pedagogue for conducting the child, medical art applied to the recovery of health,
and other like instances. We have therefore to inquire to which of these two classes belongs
the knowledge of the law,—in other words, to consider in what way it helps us towards the
avoidance of sin. If it be in the sense of indispensable aid without which the end cannot be
attained; not only was Pelagius’ answer before the judges true, but what he wrote in his book
was true also. If, however, it be of such a character that it helps indeed if it is present, but
even if it be absent, then the result is still possible to be attained by some other means,—his
answer to the judges was still true, and not unreasonably did it find favour with the bishops
that “man is assisted not to sin by the knowledge of the law;” but what he wrote in his book
is not true, that “there is no man without sin except him who has acquired a knowledge of
the law,”—a statement which the judges left undiscussed, as they were ignorant of the Latin
language, and were content with the confession of the man who was pleading his cause before
them, especially as no one was present on the other side who could oblige the interpreter
to expose his meaning by an explanation of the words of his book, and to show why it was
that the brethren were not groundlessly disturbed. For but very few persons are thoroughly
acquainted with the law. The mass of the members of Christ, who are scattered abroad
everywhere, being ignorant of the very profound and complicated contents of the law, are
commended by the piety of simple faith and unfailing hope in God, and sincere love. Endowed
with such gifts, they trust that by the grace of God they may be purged from their
sins through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="563"/>
<head>Chapter 4 <del>II.</del></head>
<p>The Same Continued.</p>
<p>If Pelagius, as he possibly might, were to say in reply to this, that that very thing was
what he meant by “the knowledge of the law, without which a man is unable to be free from
sins,” which is communicated by the teaching of faith to converts and to babes in Christ,
and in which candidates for baptism are catechetically instructed with a view to their
knowing the creed, certainly this is not what is usually meant when any one is said to have
a knowledge of the law. This phrase is only applied to such persons as are skilled in the law.
But if he persists in describing the knowledge of the law by the words in question, which,
however few in number, are great in weight, and are used to designate all who are faithfully
baptized according to the prescribed rule of the Churches; and if he maintains that it was
of this that he said, “No one is without sin, but the man who has acquired the knowledge
of the law,”—a knowledge which must needs be conveyed to believers before they attain to
the actual remission of sins,—even in such case there would crowd around him a countless
multitude, not indeed of angry disputants, but of crying baptized infants, who would exclaim,—
not, to be sure, in words, but in the very truthfulness of innocence,—“What is it,
O what is it that you have written: ‘He only can be without sin who has acquired a knowledge
of the law?’ See here are we, a large flock of lambs, without sin, and yet we have no knowledge
of the law.” Now surely they with their silent tongue would compel him to silence, or, perhaps,
even to confess that he was corrected of his great perverseness; or else (if you will), that he
had already for some time entertained the opinion which he acknowledged before his ecclesiastical
examiners, but that he had failed before to express his opinion in words of sufficient
care,—that his faith, therefore, should be approved, but this book revised and amended.
For, as the Scripture says: “There is that slippeth in his speech, but not in his heart.”1610
Now if he would only admit this, or were already saying it, who would not most readily
forgive those words which he had committed to writing with too great heedlessness and
neglect, especially on his declining to defend the opinion which the said words contain, and
affirming that to be his proper view which the truth approves? This we must suppose would
have been in the minds of the pious judges themselves, if they could only have duly understood
the contents of his Latin book, thoroughly interpreted to them, as they understood
his reply to the synod, which was spoken in Greek, and therefore quite intelligible to them,
and adjudged it as not alien from the Church. Let us go on to consider the other cases.</p>

<pb n="564"/>
<head>Chapter 5 <del>III.</del></head>
<p>The Second Item in the Accusation; And Pelagius’ Answer.</p>
<p>The synod of bishops then proceeded to say: “Let another section be read.” Accordingly
there was read the passage in the same book wherein Pelagius had laid down the position
that “all men are ruled by their own will.” On this being read, Pelagius said in answer: “This
I stated in the interest of free will. God is its helper whenever it chooses good; man, however,
when sinning is himself in fault, as under the direction of a free will.” Upon hearing this,
the bishops exclaimed: “Nor again is this opposed to the doctrine of the Church.” For who
indeed could condemn or deny the freedom of the will, when God’s help is associated with
it? His opinion, therefore, as thus explained in his answer, was, with good reason, deemed
satisfactory by the bishops. And yet, after all, the statement made in his book, “All men are
ruled by their own will,” ought without doubt to have deeply disturbed the brethren, who
had discovered what these men are accustomed to dispute against the grace of God. For it
is said, “All men are ruled by their own will,” as if God rules no man, and the Scripture says
in vain, “Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; rule them, and lift them up for
ever.”1611 They would not, of course, stay, if they are ruled only by their own will without
God, even as sheep which have no shepherd: which, God forbid for us. For, unquestionably
to be led is something more compulsory than to be ruled. He who is ruled at the same time
does something himself,—indeed, when ruled by God, it is with the express view that he
should also act rightly; whereas the man who is led can hardly be understood to do any thing
himself at all. And yet the Saviour’s helpful grace is so much better than our own wills and
desires, that the apostle does not hesitate to say: “As many as are led by the Spirit of God,
they are the sons of God.”1612 And our free will can do nothing better for us than to submit
itself to be led by Him who can do nothing amiss; and after doing this, not to doubt that it
was helped to do it by Him of whom it is said in the psalm, “He is my God, His mercy shall
go before me.”1613</p>

<p>Pelagius’ Answer Examined.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this very book which contains these statements, after laying down the position,
“All men are governed by their own will, and every one is submitted to his own desire,”
Pelagius goes on to adduce the testimony of Scripture, from which it is evident enough that
no man ought to trust to himself for direction. For on this very subject the Wisdom of Solomon
declares: “I myself also am a mortal man like unto all; and the offspring of him that
was first made of the earth,”1614—with other similar words to the conclusion of the paragraph,
where we read: “For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out
therefrom: wherefore I prayed and understanding was given to me; I called, and the Spirit
of Wisdom came into me.”1615 Now is it not clearer than light itself, how that this man, on
duly considering the wretchedness of human frailty, did not dare to commit himself to his
own direction, but prayed, and understanding was given to him, concerning which the
apostle says: “But we have the understanding of the Lord;”1616 and called, and the Spirit of
Wisdom entered into him? Now it is by this Spirit, and not by the strength of their own will,
that they who are God’s children are governed and led.</p>

<p>As for the passage from the psalm, “He loved cursing, and it shall come upon him; and
he willed not blessing, so it shall be far removed from him,”1617 which he quoted in the
same book of Chapters, as if to prove that “all men are ruled by their own will,” who can be
ignorant that this is a fault not of nature as God created it, but of human will which departed
from God? The fact indeed is, that even if he had not loved cursing, and had willed blessing,
he would in this very case, too, deny that his will had received any assistance from God; in
his ingratitude and impiety, moreover, he would submit himself to be ruled by himself,
until he found out by his penalties that, sunk as he was into ruin, without God to govern
him he was utterly unable to direct his own self. In like manner, from the passage which he
quoted in the same book under the same head, “He hath set fire and water before thee;
stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt; before man are good and evil, life and death,
and whichever he liketh shall be given to him,”1618 it is manifest that, if he applies his hand
to fire, and if evil and death please him, his human will effects all this; but if, on the contrary,
he loves goodness and life, not alone does his will accomplish the happy choice, but it is
assisted by divine grace. The eye indeed is sufficient for itself, for not seeing, that is, for
darkness; but for seeing, it is in its own light not sufficient for itself unless the assistance of
a clear external light is rendered to it. God forbid, however, that they who are “the called
according to His purpose, whom He also foreknew, and predestinated to be conformed to
the likeness of His Son,”1619 should be given up to their own desire to perish. This is suffered
only by “the vessels of wrath,”1620 who are perfected for perdition; in whose very destruction,
indeed, God “makes known the riches of His glory on the vessels of His mercy.”1621 Now
it is on this account that, after saying, “He is my God, His mercy shall go before me,”1622
he immediately adds, “My God will show me vengeance upon my enemies.”1623 That
therefore happens to them which is mentioned in Scripture, “God gave them up to the lusts
of their own heart.”1624 This, however, does not happen to the predestinated, who are ruled
by the Spirit of God, for not in vain is their cry: “Deliver me not, O Lord, to the sinner, according
to my desire.”1625 With regard, indeed, to the evil lusts which assail them, their

<p>This being the case, how must God’s children, who have learned the truth of all this and
rejoice at being ruled and led by the Spirit of God, have been affected when they heard or
read that Pelagius had declared in writing that “all men are governed by their own will, and
that every one is submitted to his own desire?” And yet, when questioned by the bishops,
he fully perceived what an evil impression these words of his might produce, and told them
in answer that “he had made such an assertion in the interest of free will,”—adding at once,
“God is its helper whenever it chooses good; whilst man is himself in fault when he sins, as
being under the influence of a free will.” Although the pious judges approved of this sentiment
also, they were unwilling to consider or examine how incautiously he had written, or indeed
in what sense he had employed the words found in his book. They thought it was enough
that he had made such a confession concerning free will, as to admit that God helped the
man who chose the good, whereas the man who sinned was himself to blame, his own will
sufficing for him in this direction. According to this, God rules those whom He assists in
their choice of the good. So far, then, as they rule anything themselves, they rule it rightly,
since they themselves are ruled by Him who is right and good.</p>

<p>The Third Item in the Accusation; And Pelagius’ Answer.</p>
<p>Another statement was read which Pelagius had placed in his book, to this effect: “In
the day of judgment no forbearance will be shown to the ungodly and the sinners, but they
will be consumed in eternal fires.” This induced the brethren to regard the statement as
open to the objection, that it seemed so worded as to imply that all sinners whatever were
to be punished with an eternal punishment, without excepting even those who hold Christ
as their foundation, although “they build thereupon wood, hay, stubble,”1627 concerning
whom the apostle writes: “If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he
shall himself be saved, yet so as by fire.”1628 When, however, Pelagius responded that “he
had made his assertion in accordance with the Gospel, in which it is written concerning
sinners, ‘These shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into life eternal,’”1629
it was impossible for Christian judges to be dissatisfied with a sentence which is written in
the Gospel, and was spoken by the Lord; especially as they knew not what there was in the
words taken from Pelagius’ book which could so disturb the brethren, who were accustomed
to hear his discussions and those of his followers. Since also they were absent1630 who
presented the indictment against Pelagius to the holy bishop Eulogius, there was no one to
urge him that he ought to distinguish, by some exception, between those sinners who are
to be saved by fire, and those who are to be punished with everlasting perdition. If, indeed,
the judges had come to understand by these means the reason why the objection had been
made to his statement, had he then refused to allow the distinction, he would have been
justly open to blame.</p>

<p>Pelagius’ Answer Examined. On Origen’s Error Concerning the Non-
Eternity of the Punishment of the Devil and the Damned.</p>
<p>But what Pelagius added, “Who believes differently is an Origenist,” was approved by
the judges, because in very deed the Church most justly abominates the opinion of Origen,
that even they whom the Lord says are to be punished with everlasting punishment, and
the devil himself and his angels, after a time, however protracted, will be purged, and released
from their penalties, and shall then cleave to the saints who reign with God in the association
of blessedness. This additional sentence, therefore, the synod pronounced to be “not opposed
to the Church,”—not in accordance with Pelagius, but rather in accordance with the Gospel,
that such ungodly and sinful men shall be consumed by eternal fires as the Gospel determines
to be worthy of such a punishment; and that he is a sharer in Origen’s abominable opinion,
who affirms that their punishment can possibly ever come to an end, when the Lord has
said it is to be eternal. Concerning those sinners, however, of whom the apostle declares
that “they shall be saved, yet so as by fire, after their work has been burnt up,”1631 inasmuch
as no objectionable opinion in reference to them was manifestly charged against Pelagius,
the synod determined nothing. Wherefore he who says that the ungodly and sinner, whom
the truth consigns to eternal punishment, can ever be liberated therefrom, is not unfitly
designated by Pelagius as an “Origenist.” But, on the other hand, he who supposes that no
sinner whatever deserves mercy in the judgment of God, may be designated by whatever
name Pelagius is disposed to give to him, only it must at the same time be quite understood
that this error is not received as truth by the Church. “For he shall have judgment without
mercy that hath showed no mercy.”1632</p>

<p>The Same Continued.</p>
<p>But how this judgment is to be accomplished, it is not easy to understand from Holy
Scripture; for there are many modes therein of describing that which is to come to pass only
in one mode. In one place the Lord declares that He will “shut the door” against those whom
He does not admit into His kingdom; and that, on their clamorously demanding admission,
“Open unto us, . . . we have eaten and drunk in Thy presence,” and so forth, as the Scripture
describes, “He will say unto them in answer, I know you not, . . . all ye workers of
iniquity.”1633 In another passage He reminds us that He will command “all which would
not that He should reign over them to be brought to Him, and be slain in His presence.”1634
In another place, again, He tells us that He will come with His angels in His majesty; and
before Him shall be gathered all nations, and He shall separate them one from another;
some He will set on His right hand, and after enumerating their good works, will award to
them eternal life; and others on His left hand, whose barrenness in all good works He will
expose, will He condemn to everlasting fire.1635 In two other passages He deals with that
wicked and slothful servant, who neglected to trade with His money,1636 and with the man
who was found at the feast without the wedding garment,—and He orders them to be bound
hand and foot, and to be cast into outer darkness.1637 And in yet another scripture, after
admitting the five virgins who were wise, He shuts the door against the other five foolish
ones.1638 Now these descriptions,—and there are others which at the instant do not occur
to me,—are all intended to represent to us the future judgment, which of course will be held
not over one, or over five, but over multitudes. For if it were a solitary case only of the man
who was cast into outer darkness for not having on the wedding garment, He would not
have gone on at once to give it a plural turn, by saying: “For many are called, but few are
chosen;” 1639 whereas it is plain that, after the one was cast out and condemned, many still
remained behind in the house. However, it would occupy us too long to discuss all these
questions to the full. This brief remark, however, I may make, without prejudice (as they
say in pecuniary affairs) to some better discussion, that by the many descriptions which are
scattered throughout the Holy Scriptures there is signified to us but one mode of final
judgment, which is inscrutable to us,—with only the variety of deservings preserved in the
rewards and punishments. Touching the particular point, indeed, which we have before us

at present, it is sufficient to remark that, if Pelagius had actually said that all sinners whatever
without exception would be punished in an eternity of punishment by everlasting fire, then
whosoever had approved of this judgment would, to begin with, have brought the sentence
down on his own head. “For who will boast that he is pure from sins?”1640 Forasmuch,
however, as he did not say all, nor certain, but made an indefinite statement only,—and afterwards,
in explanation, declared that his meaning was according to the words of the Gospel,—
his opinion was affirmed by the judgment of the bishops to be true; but it does not
even now appear what Pelagius really thinks on the subject, and in consequence there is no
indecency in inquiring further into the decision of the episcopal judges.</p>

<p>The Fourth Item in the Accusation; And Pelagius’ Answer.</p>
<p>It was further objected against Pelagius, as if he had written in his book, that “evil does
not enter our thoughts.” In reply, however, to this charge, he said: “We made no such
statement. What we did say was, that the Christian ought to be careful not to have evil
thoughts.” Of this, as it became them, the bishops approved. For who can doubt that evil
ought not to be thought of? And, indeed, if what he said in his book about “evil not being
thought” runs in this form, “neither is evil to be thought of,” the ordinary meaning of such
words is “that evil ought not even to be thought of.” Now if any person denies this, what
else does he in fact say, than that evil ought to be thought of? And if this were true, it could
not be said in praise of love that “it thinketh no evil!”1641 But after all, the phrase about “not
entering into the thoughts” of righteous and holy men is not quite a commendable one, for
this reason, that what enters the mind is commonly called a thought, even when assent to
it does not follow. The thought, however, which contracts blame, and is justly forbidden, is
never unaccompanied with assent. Possibly those men had an incorrect copy of Pelagius’
writings, who thought it proper to object to him that he had used the words: “Evil does not
enter into our thoughts;” that is, that whatever is evil never enters into the thoughts of
righteous and holy men. Which is, of course, a very absurd statement. For whenever we
censure evil things, we cannot enunciate them in words, unless they have been thought. But,
as we said before, that is termed a culpable thought of evil which carries with it assent.</p>

<p>The Fifth Item of the Accusation; And Pelagius’ Answer.</p>
<p>After the judges had accorded their approbation to this answer of Pelagius, another
passage which he had written in his book was read aloud: “The kingdom of heaven was
promised even in the Old Testament.” Upon this, Pelagius remarked in vindication: “This
can be proved by the Scriptures: but heretics, in order to disparage the Old Testament, deny
this. I, however, simply followed the authority of the Scriptures when I said this; for in the
prophet Daniel it is written: ‘The saints shall receive the kingdom of the Most. High.’”1642

faith.”</p>

<p>Examination of This Point. The Phrase “Old Testament” Used in Two
Senses. The Heir of the Old Testament. In the Old Testament There Were Heirs
of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Was it therefore without reason that our brethren were moved by his words to include
this charge among the others against him? Certainly not. The fact is, that the phrase Old
Testament is constantly employed in two different ways,—in one, following the authority
of the Holy Scriptures; in the other, following the most common custom of speech. For the
Apostle Paul says, in his Epistle to the Galatians: “Tell me, ye that desire to be under the
law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid,
the other by a free woman. . . .Which things are an allegory: for these are the two
testaments; the one which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. For this is Mount Sinai in
Arabia, and is conjoined with the Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children;
whereas the Jerusalem which is above is free, and is the mother of us all.”1643 Now,
inasmuch as the Old Testament belongs to bondage, whence it is written, “Cast out the
bond-woman and her son, for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with my son
Isaac,”1644 but the kingdom of heaven to liberty; what has the kingdom of heaven to do with
the Old Testament? Since, however, as I have already remarked, we are accustomed, in our
ordinary use of words, to designate all those Scriptures of the law and the prophets which
were given previous to the Lord’s incarnation, and are embraced together by canonical authority,
under the name and title of the Old Testament, what man who is ever so moderately
informed in ecclesiastical lore can be ignorant that the kingdom of heaven could be quite
as well promised in those early Scriptures as even the New Testament itself, to which the
kingdom of heaven belongs? At all events, in those ancient Scriptures it is most distinctly
written: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will consummate a new testament
with the house of Israel and with the house of Jacob; not according to the testament that I
made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the
land of Egypt.”1645 This was done on Mount Sinai. But then there had not yet risen the
prophet Daniel to say: “The saints shall receive the kingdom of the Most High.”1646 For by
these words he foretold the merit not of the Old, but of the New Testament. In the same
manner did the same prophets foretell that Christ Himself would come, in whose blood the
New Testament was consecrated. Of this Testament also the apostles became the ministers,
as the most blessed Paul declares: “He hath made us able ministers of the New Testament;

<pb n="576"/>
not in its letter, but in spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”1647 In that testament,
however, which is properly called the Old, and was given on Mount Sinai, only
earthly happiness is expressly promised. Accordingly that land, into which the nation, after
being led through the wilderness, was conducted, is called the land of promise, wherein
peace and royal power, and the gaining of victories over enemies, and an abundance of
children and of fruits of the ground, and gifts of a similar kind are the promises of the Old
Testament. And these, indeed, are figures of the spiritual blessings which appertain to the
New Testament; but yet the man who lives under God’s law with those earthly blessings for
his sanction, is precisely the heir of the Old Testament, for just such rewards are promised
and given to him, according to the terms of the Old Testament, as are the objects of his desire
according to the condition of the old man. But whatever blessings are there figuratively set
forth as appertaining to the New Testament require the new man to give them effect. And
no doubt the great apostle understood perfectly well what he was saying, when he described
the two testaments as capable of the allegorical distinction of the bond-woman and the
free,—attributing the children of the flesh to the Old, and to the New the children of the
promise: “They,” says he, “which are the children of the flesh, are not the children of God;
but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.”1648 The children of the flesh, then,
belong to the earthly Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children; whereas the children
of the promise belong to the Jerusalem above, the free, the mother of us all, eternal in the
heavens.1649 Whence we can easily see who they are that appertain to the earthly, and who
to the heavenly kingdom. But then the happy persons, who even in that early age were by
the grace of God taught to understand the distinction now set forth, were thereby made the
children of promise, and were accounted in the secret purpose of God as heirs of the New
Testament; although they continued with perfect fitness to administer the Old Testament
to the ancient people of God, because it was divinely appropriated to that people in God’s
distribution of the times and seasons.</p>

<p>The Same Continued.</p>
<p>How then should there not be a feeling of just disquietude entertained by the children
of promise, children of the free Jerusalem, which is eternal in the heavens, when they see
that by the words of Pelagius the distinction which has been drawn by Apostolic and catholic
authority is abolished, and Agar is supposed to be by some means on a par with Sarah?
He therefore does injury to the scripture of the Old Testament with heretical impiety, who
with an impious and sacrilegious face denies that it was inspired by the good, supreme, and
very God,—as Marcion does, as Manichæus does, and other pests of similar opinions. On
this account (that I may put into as brief a space as I can what my own views are on the
subject), as much injury is done to the New Testament, when it is put on the same level with
the Old Testament, as is inflicted on the Old itself when men deny it to be the work of the
supreme God of goodness. Now, when Pelagius in his answer gave as his reason for saying
that even in the Old Testament there was a promise of the kingdom of heaven, the testimony
of the prophet Daniel, who most plainly foretold that the saints should receive the kingdom
of the Most High, it was fairly decided that the statement of Pelagius was not opposed to
the catholic faith, although not according to the distinction which shows that the earthly
promises of Mount Sinai are the proper characteristics of the Old Testament; nor indeed
was the decision an improper one, considering that mode of speech which designates all
the canonical Scriptures which were given to men before the Lord’s coming in the flesh by
the title of the “Old Testament.” The kingdom of the Most High is of course none other
than the kingdom of God; otherwise, anybody might boldly contend that the kingdom of
God is one thing, and the kingdom of heaven another.</p>

<p>The Sixth Item of the Accusation, and Pelagius’ Reply.</p>
<p>The next objection was to the effect that Pelagius in that same book of his wrote thus:
“A man is able, if he likes, to be without sin;” and that writing to a certain widow he said,
flatteringly: “In thee piety may find a dwelling-place, such as she finds nowhere else; in thee
righteousness, though a stranger, can find a home; truth, which no one any longer recognises,
can discover an abode and a friend in thee; and the law of God, which almost everybody
despises, may be honoured by thee alone.” And in another sentence he writes to her: “O
how happy and blessed art thou, when that righteousness which we must believe to flourish
only in heaven has found a shelter on earth only in thy heart!” In another work addressed
to her, after reciting the prayer of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and teaching her in
what manner saints ought to pray, he says: “He worthily raises his hands to God, and with
a good conscience does he pour out his prayer, who is able to say, ‘Thou, O Lord, knowest
how holy, and harmless, and pure from all injury and iniquity and violence, are the hands
which I stretch out to Thee; how righteous, and pure, and free from all deceit, are the lips
with which I offer to Thee my supplication, that Thou wouldst have mercy upon me.’” To
all this Pelagius said in answer: “We asserted that a man could be without sin, and could
keep God’s commandments if he wished; for this capacity has been given to him by God.
But we never said that any man could be found who at no time whatever, from infancy to
old age, had committed sin: but that if any person were converted from his sins, he could
by his own labour and God’s grace be without sin; and yet not even thus would he be incapable
of change ever afterwards. As for the other statements which they have made against
us, they are not to be found in our books, nor have we at any time said such things.” Upon
hearing this vindication, the synod put this question to him: “You have denied having ever
written such words; are you therefore ready to anathematize those who do hold these
opinions?” Pelagius answered: “I anathematize them as fools, not as heretics, for there is no
dogma.” The bishops then pronounced their judgment in these words: “Since now Pelagius
has with his own mouth anathematized this vague statement as foolish verbiage, justly declaring
in his reply, ‘That a man is able with God’s assistance and grace to be without sin,’
let him now proceed to answer the other heads of accusation against him.”</p>

<p>Examination of the Sixth Charge and Answers.</p>
<p>Well, now, had the judges either the power or the right to condemn these unrecognised
and vague words, when no person on the other side was present to assert that Pelagius had
written the very culpable sentences which were alleged to have been addressed by him to
the widow? In such a matter, it surely could not be enough to produce a manuscript, and
to read out of it words as his, if there were not also witnesses forthcoming in case he denied,
on the words being read out, that they ever dropped from his pen. But even here the judges
did all that lay in their power to do, when they asked Pelagius whether he would anathematize
the persons who held such sentiments as he declared he had never himself propounded
either in speech or in writing. And when he answered that he did anathematize them as
fools, what right had the judges to push the inquiry any further on the matter, in the absence
of Pelagius’ opponents?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">

<p>The Same Continued.</p>
<p>But perhaps the point requires some consideration, whether he was right in saying that
“such as held the opinions in question deserved anathema, not as heretics, but as fools, since
it was no dogma.” The question, when fairly confronted, is no doubt far from being an unimportant
one,—how far a man deserves to be described as a heretic; on this occasion,
however, the judges acted rightly in abstaining from it altogether. If any one, for example,
were to allege that eaglets are suspended in the talons of the parent bird, and so exposed to
the rays of the sun, and such as wink are flung to the ground as spurious, the light being in
some mysterious way the gauge of their genuine nature, he is not to be accounted a heretic,
if the story happens to be untrue.1650 And, since it occurs in the writings of the learned and
is very commonly received as fact, ought it to be considered a foolish thing to mention it,
even though it be not true? much less ought our credit, which gains for us the name of being
trustworthy, to be affected, on the one hand injuriously if the story be believed by us, or
beneficially if disbelieved.1651 If, to go a step further in illustration, any one were from this
opinion to contend that there existed in birds reasonable souls, from the notion that human
souls at intervals passed into them, then indeed we should have to reject from our mind
and ears alike an idea like this as the rankest heresy; and even if the story about the eagles
were true (as there are many curious facts about bees before our eyes, that are true), we
should still have to consider, and demonstrate, the great difference that exists between the
condition of creatures like these, which are quite irrational, however surprising in their
powers of sensation, and the nature which is common (not to men and beasts, but) to men
and angels. There are, to be sure, a great many foolish things said by foolish and ignorant
persons, which yet fail to prove them heretics. One might instance the silly talk so commonly
heard about the pursuits of other people, from persons who have never learned these pursuits,—
equally hasty and untenable whether in the shape of excessive and indiscriminate
praise of those they love, or of blame in the case of those they happen to dislike. The same
remark might be made concerning the usual curent of human conversation: whenever it
does touch on a subject which requires dogmatic acuracy of statement, but is thrown out
at random or suggested by the passing moment, it is too often pervaded by foolish levity,
whether uttered by the mouth or expressed in writing. Many persons, indeed, when gently
reminded of their reckless gossip, have afterwards much regretted their conduct; they scarcely
recollected what they had never uttered with a fixed purpose, but had poured forth in a
sheer volley of casual and unconsidered words. It is, unhappily, almost impossible to be

quite clear of such faults. Who is he “that slippeth not in his tongue,”1652 and “offendeth
not in word?”1653 It, however, makes all the difference in the world, to what extent, and
from what motive, and whether in fact at all, a man when warned of his fault corrects it, or
obstinately clings to it so as to make a dogma and settled opinion of that which he had not
at first uttered on purpose, but only in levity. Although, then, it turns out eventually that
every heretic is a fool, it does not follow that every fool must immediately be named a heretic.
The judges were quite right in saying that Pelagius had anathematized the vague folly under
consideration by its fitting designation for even if it were heresy, there could be no doubt
of its being foolish prattle. Whatever, therefore, it was, they designated the offence under a
general name. But whether the quoted words had been used with any definitely dogmatic
purpose, or only in a vague and indeterminate sense, and with an unmeaningness which
should be capable of an easy correction, they did not deem it necessary to discuss on the
present occasion, since the man who was on his trial before them denied that the words
were his at all, in whatever sense they had been employed.</p>

<p>The Same Continued.</p>
<p>Now it so happened that, while we were reading this defence of Pelagius in the small
paper which we received at first,1654 there were present certain holy brethren, who said that
they had in their possession some hortatory or consolatory works which Pelagius had addressed
to a widow lady whose name did not appear, and they advised us to examine
whether the words which he had abjured for his own occurred anywhere in these books.
They were not themselves aware whether they did or not. The said books were accordingly
read through, and the words in question were actually discovered in them. Moreover, they
who had produced the copy of the book, affirmed that for now almost four years they had
had these books as Pelagius’, nor had they once heard a doubt expressed about his authorship.
Considering, then, from the integrity of these servants of God, which was very well known
to us, how impossible it was for them to use deceit in the matter, the conclusion seemed
inevitable, that Pelagius must be supposed by us to have rather been the deceiver at his trial
before the bishops; unless we should think it possible that something may have been published,
even for so many years, in his name, although not actually composed by him; for our
informants did not tell us that they had received the books from Pelagius himself, nor had
they ever heard him admit his own authorship. Now, in my own case, certain of our brethren
have told me that sundry writings have found their way into Spain under my name. Such
persons, indeed, as had read my genuine writings could not recognise those others as mine;
although by other persons my authorship of them was quite believed.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.</head>
<p>The Same Continued. Pelagius Acknowledges the Doctrine of Grace
in Deceptive Terms.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that what Pelagius has acknowledged as his own is as yet very
obscure. I suppose, however, that it will become apparent in the subsequent details of these
proceedings. Now he says: “We have affirmed that a man is able to be without sin, and to
keep the commandments of God if he wishes, inasmuch as God has given him this ability.
But we have not said that any man can be found, who from infancy to old age has never
committed sin; but that if any person were converted from his sins, he could by his own
exertion and God’s grace be without sin; and yet not even thus would he be incapable of
change afterwards.” Now it is quite uncertain what he means in these words by the grace of
God; and the judges, catholic as they were, could not possibly understand by the phrase
anything else than the grace which is so very strongly recommended to us in the apostle’s
teaching. Now this is the grace whereby we hope that we can be delivered from the body of
this death through our Lord Jesus Christ,1655 [VII.] and for the obtaining of which we pray
that we may not be led into temptation.1656 This grace is not nature, but that which renders
assistance to frail and corrupted nature. This grace is not the knowledge of the law, but is
that of which the apostle says: “I will not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness
come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.”1657 Therefore it is not “the letter that killeth,
but the life-giving spirit.”1658 For the knowledge of the law, without the grace of the Spirit,
produces all kinds of concupiscence in man; for, as the apostle says, “I had not known sin
but by the law: I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin,
taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.”1659
By saying this, however, he blames not the law; he rather praises it, for he says afterwards:
“The law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”1660 And he goes
on to ask: “Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it
might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.”1661 And, again, he praises
the law by saying: “We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin. For
that which I do I know not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then
I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.”1662 Observe, then, he

knows the law, praises it, and consents to it; for what it commands, that he also wishes; and
what it forbids, and condemns, that he also hates: but for all that, what he hates, that he actually
does. There is in his mind, therefore, a knowledge of the holy law of God, but still his
evil concupiscence is not cured. He has a good will within him, but still what he does is evil.
Hence it comes to pass that, amidst the mutual struggles of the two laws within him,—“the
law in his members warring against the law of his mind, and making him captive to the law
of sin,”1663—he confesses his misery; and exclaims in such words as these: “O wretched
man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death? The grace of God, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.”1664</p>

<p>It is not nature, therefore, which, sold as it is under sin and wounded by the offence,
longs for a Redeemer and Saviour; nor is it the knowledge of the law—through which comes
the discovery, not the expulsion, of sin—which delivers us from the body of this death; but
it is the Lord’s good grace through our Lord Jesus Christ.1665</p>

<p>This grace is not dying nature, nor the slaying letter, but the vivifying spirit; for already
did he possess nature with freedom of will, because he said: “To will is present with me.”1666
Nature, however, in a healthy condition and without a flaw, he did not possess, for he said:
“I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth nothing good.”1667 Already had he the
knowledge of God’s holy law, for he said: “I had not known sin but through the law;”1668
yet for all that, he did not possess strength and power to practise and fulfil righteousness,
for he complained: “What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.”1669 And again,
“How to accomplish that which is good I find not.”1670 Therefore it is not from the liberty
of the human will, nor from the precepts of the law, that there comes deliverance from the
body of this death; for both of these he had already,—the one in his nature, the other in his
learning; but all he wanted was the help of the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>The Same Continued. The Synod Supposed that the Grace Acknowledged
by Pelagius Was that Which Was So Thoroughly Known to the Church.</p>
<p>This grace, then, which was most completely known in the catholic Church (as the
bishops were well aware), they supposed Pelagius made confession of, when they heard him
say that “a man, when converted from his sins, is able by his own exertion and the grace of
God to be without sin.” For my own part, however, I remembered the treatise which had
been given to me, that I might refute it, by those servants of God, who had been Pelagius’
followers. 1671 They, notwithstanding their great affection for him, plainly acknowledged
that the passage was his; when, on this question being proposed, because he had already
given offence to very many persons from advancing views against the grace of God, he most
expressly admitted that “what he meant by God’s grace was that, when our nature was created,
it received the capacity of not sinning, because it was created with free will.” On account,
therefore, of this treatise, I cannot help feeling still anxious, whilst many of the brethren
who are well acquainted with his discussions, share in my anxiety, lest under the ambiguity
which notoriously characterizes his words there lies some latent reserve, and lest he should
afterwards tell his followers that it was without prejudice to his own doctrine that he made
any admissions,—discoursing thus: “I no doubt asserted that a man was able by his own
exertion and the grace of God to live without sin; but you know very well what I mean by
grace; and you may recollect reading that grace is that in which we are created by God with
a free will.” Accordingly, while the bishops understood him to mean the grace by which we
have by adoption been made new creatures, not that by which we were created (for most
plainly does Holy Scripture instruct us in the former sense of grace as the true one), ignorant
of his being a heretic, they acquitted him as a catholic.1672 I must say that my suspicion is
excited also by this, that in the work which I answered, he most openly said that “righteous
Abel never sinned at all.”1673 Now, however, he thus expresses himself: “But we did not say
that any man could be found who at no time whatever, from infancy to old age, has committed
sin; but that, if any man were converted from his sins, he could by his own labour and
God’s grace be without sin.”1674 When speaking of righteous Abel, he did not say that after
being converted from his sins he became sinless in a new life, but that he never committed
sin at all. If, then, that book be his, it must of course be corrected and amended from his
answer. For I should be sorry to say that he was insincere in his more recent statement; lest
perhaps he should say that he had forgotten what he had previously written in the book we

have quoted. Let us therefore direct our view to what afterwards occurred. Now, from the
sequel of these ecclesiastical proceedings, we can by God’s help show that, although Pelagius,
as some suppose, cleared himself in his examination, and was at all events acquitted by his
judges (who were, however, but human beings after all), that this great heresy,1675 which
we should be most unwilling to see making further progress or becoming aggravated in
guilt, was undoubtedly itself condemned.</p>

<p>The Seventh Item of the Accusation: the Breviates of Coelestius
Objected to Pelagius.</p>
<p>Then follow sundry statements charged against Pelagius, which are said to be found
among the opinions of his disciple Coelestius: how that “Adam was created mortal, and
would have died whether he had sinned or not sinned; that Adam’s sin injured only himself
and not the human race; that the law no less than the gospel leads us to the kingdom; that
there were sinless men previous to the coming of Christ; that new-born infants are in the
same condition as Adam was before the fall; that the whole human race does not, on the
one hand, die through Adam’s death or transgression, nor, on the other hand, does the
whole human race rise again through the resurrection of Christ.” These have been so objected
to, that they are even said to have been, after a full hearing, condemned at Carthage by your
holiness and other bishops associated with you.1676 I was not present on that occasion, as
you will recollect; but afterwards, on my arrival at Carthage, I read over the Acts of the
synod, some of which I perfectly well remember, but I do not know whether all the tenets
now mentioned occur among them. But what matters it if some of them were possibly not
mentioned, and so not included in the condemnation of the synod when it is quite clear
that they deserve condemnation? Sundry other points of error were next alleged against
him, connected with the mention of my own name.1677 They had been transmitted to me
from Sicily, some of our Catholic brethren there being perplexed by questions of this kind;
and I drew up a reply to them in a little work addressed to Hilary,1678 who had consulted
me respecting them in a letter. My answer, in my opinion, was a sufficient one. These are
the errors referred to: “That a man is able to be without sin if he wishes. That infants, even
if they die unbaptized, have eternal life. That rich men, even if they are baptized, unless they
renounce all, have, whatever good they may seem to have done, nothing of it reckoned to
them; neither can they possess the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p>Pelagius’ Answer to the Charges Brought Together Under the Seventh
Item.</p>
<p>The following, as the proceedings testify, was Pelagius’ own answer to these charges
against him: “Concerning a man’s being able indeed to be without sin, we have spoken,”
says he, “already; concerning the fact, however, that before the Lord’s coming there were
persons without sin, we say now that, previous to Christ’s advent, some men lived holy and
righteous lives, according to the teaching of the sacred Scriptures. The rest were not said by
me, as even their testimony goes to show, and for them, I do not feel that I am responsible.
But for the satisfaction of the holy synod, I anathematize those who either now hold, or
have ever held, these opinions.” After hearing this answer of his, the synod said: “With regard
to these charges aforesaid, Pelagius has in our presence given us sufficient and proper satisfaction,
by anathematizing the opinions which were not his.” We see, therefore, and maintain
that the most pernicious evils of this heresy have been condemned, not only by Pelagius,
but also by the holy bishops who presided over that inquiry:—that “Adam was made mortal;”
(and, that the meaning of this statement might be more clearly understood, it was added,
“and he would have died whether he had sinned or not sinned;”) that his sin injured only
himself and not the human race; that the law, no less than the gospel, leads us to the kingdom
of heaven; that new born infants are in the same condition that Adam was before the fall;
that the entire human race does not, on the one hand, die through Adam’s death and
transgression, nor, on the other hand, does the whole human race rise again through the
resurrection of Christ; that infants, even if they die unbaptized, have eternal life; that rich
men even if baptized, unless they renounce and give up all, have, whatever good they may
seem to have done, nothing of it reckoned to them, neither can they possess the kingdom
of God;”—all these opinions, at any rate, were clearly condemned in that ecclesiastical
court,—Pelagius pronouncing the anathema, and the bishops the interlocutory sentence.</p>

<p>The Pelagians Falsely Pretended that the Eastern Churches Were on
Their Side.</p>
<p>Now, by reason of these questions, and the very contentious assertions of these tenets,
which are everywhere accompanied with heated feelings, many weak brethren were disturbed.
We have accordingly, in the anxiety of that love which it becomes us to feel towards the
Church of Christ through His grace, and out of regard to Marcellinus of blessed memory
(who was extremely vexed day by day by these disputers, and who asked my advice by letter),
been obliged to write on some of these questions, and especially on the baptism of infants.
On this same subject also I afterwards, at your request, and assisted by your prayers, delivered
an earnest address, to the best of my ability, in the church of the Majores,1679 holding in
my hands an epistle of the most glorious martyr Cyprian, and reading therefrom and applying
his words on the very matter, in order to remove this dangerous error out of the hearts of
sundry persons, who had been persuaded to take up with the opinions which, as we see,
were condemned in these proceedings. These opinions it has been attempted by their promoters
to force upon the minds of some of the brethren, by threatening, as if from the
Eastern Churches, that unless they adopted the said opinions, they would be formally condemned
by those Churches. Observe, however, that no less than fourteen bishops of the
Eastern Church,1680 assembled in synod in the land where the Lord manifested His presence
in the days of His flesh, refused to acquit Pelagius unless he condemned these opinions as
opposed to the Catholic faith. Since, therefore, he was then acquitted because he anathematized
such views, it follows beyond a doubt that the said opinions were condemned. This,
indeed, will appear more clearly still, and on still stronger evidence, in the sequel.</p>

<p>The Accusations in the Seventh Item, Which Pelagius Confessed.</p>
<p>Let us now see what were the two points out of all that were alleged which Pelagius was
unwilling to anathematize, and admitted to be his own opinions, but to remove their offensive
aspect explained in what sense he held them. “That a man,” says he, “is able to be without
sin has been asserted already.” Asserted no doubt, and we remember the assertion quite
well; but still it was mitigated, and approved by the judges, in that God’s grace was added,
concerning which nothing was said in the original draft of his doctrine. Touching the second,
however, of these points, we ought to pay careful attention to what he said in answer to the
charge against him. “Concerning the fact, indeed,” says he, “that before the Lord’s coming
there were persons without sin, we now again assert that previous to Christ’s advent some
men lived holy and righteous lives, according to the teaching of the sacred Scriptures.” He
did not dare to say: “We now again assert that previous to Christ’s advent there were persons
without sin,” although this had been laid to his charge after the very words of Coelestius.
For he perceived how dangerous such a statement was, and into what trouble it would bring
him. So he reduced the sentence to these harmless dimensions: “We again assert that before
the coming of Christ there were persons who led holy and righteous lives.” Of course there
were: who would deny it? But to say this is a very different thing from saying that they lived
“without sin.” Because, indeed, those ancient worthies lived holy and righteous lives, they
could for that very reason better confess: “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.”1681 In the present day, also, many men live holy and righteous
lives; but yet it is no untruth they utter when in their prayer they say: “Forgive us our debts,
even as we forgive our debtors.”1682 This avowal was accordingly acceptable to the judges,
in the sense in which Pelagius solemnly declared his belief; but certainly not in the sense
which Coelestius, according to the original charge against him, was said to hold. We must
now treat in detail of the topics which still remain, to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>The Eighth Item in the Accusation.</p>
<p>Pelagius was charged with having said: “That the Church here is without spot or wrinkle.”
It was on this point that the Donatists also were constantly at conflict with us in our conference.
We used, in their case, to lay especial stress on the mixture of bad men with good, like
that of the chaff with the wheat; and we were led to this idea by the similitude of the
threshing-floor. We might apply the same illustration in answer to our present opponents,
unless indeed they would have the Church consist only of good men, whom they assert to
be without any sin whatever, that so the Church might be without spot or wrinkle. If this
be their meaning, then I repeat the same words as I quoted just now; for how can they be
members of the Church, of whom the voice of a truthful humility declares, “If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?”1683 or how could the
Church offer up that prayer which the Lord taught her to use, “Forgive us our debts,”1684
if in this world the Church is without a spot or blemish? In short, they must themselves
submit to be strictly catechised respecting themselves: do they really allow that they have
any sins of their own? If their answer is in the negative, then they must be plainly told that
they are deceiving themselves, and the truth is not in them. If, however, they shall acknowledge
that they do commit sin, what is this but a confession of their own wrinkle and spot?
They therefore are not members of the Church; because the Church is without spot and
wrinkle, while they have both spot and wrinkle.</p>

<p>Pelagius’ Reply to the Eighth Item of Accusation.</p>
<p>But to this objection he replied with a watchful caution such as the catholic judges no
doubt approved. “It has,” says he, “been asserted by me,—but in such a sense that the Church
is by the laver cleansed from every spot and wrinkle, and in this purity the Lord wishes her
to continue.” Whereupon the synod said: “Of this also we approve.” And who amongst us
denies that in baptism the sins of all men are remitted, and that all believers come up spotless
and pure from the laver of regeneration? Or what catholic Christian is there who wishes
not, as his Lord also wishes, and as it is meant to be, that the Church should remain always
without spot or wrinkle? For in very deed God is now in His mercy and truth bringing it
about, that His holy Church should be conducted to that perfect state in which she is to remain
without spot or wrinkle for evermore. But between the laver, where all past stains and
deformities are removed, and the kingdom, where the Church will remain for ever without
any spot or wrinkle, there is this present intermediate time of prayer, during which her cry
must of necessity be: “Forgive us our debts.” Hence arose the objection against them for
saying that “the Church here on earth is without spot or wrinkle;” from the doubt whether
by this opinion they did not boldly prohibit that prayer whereby the Church in her present
baptized state entreats day and night for herself the forgiveness of her sins. On the subject
of this intervening period between the remission of sins which takes place in baptism, and
the perpetuity of sinlessness which is to be in the kingdom of heaven, no proceedings ensued
with Pelagius, and no decision was pronounced by the bishops. Only he thought that some
brief indication ought to be given that he had not expressed himself in the way which the
accusation against him seemed to state. As to his saying, “This has been asserted by me,—but
in such a sense,” what else did he mean to convey than the idea that he had not in fact expressed
himself in the same manner as he was supposed to have done by his accusers? That,
however, which induced the judges to say that they were satisfied with his answer was baptism
as the means of being washed from our sins; and the kingdom of heaven, in which the holy
Church, which is now in process of cleansing, shall continue in a sinless state for ever: this
is clear from the evidence, so far as I can form an opinion.</p>

<p>The Ninth Item of the Accusation; And Pelagius’ Reply.</p>
<p>The next objections were urged out of the book of Coelestius, following the contents of
each several chapter, but rather according to the sense than the words. These indeed he expatiates
on rather fully; they, however, who presented the indictment against Pelagius said
that they had been unable at the moment to adduce all the words. In the first chapter, then,
of Coelestius’ book they alleged that the following was written: “That we do more than is
commanded us in the law and the gospel.” To this Pelagius replied: “This they have set down
as my statement. What we said, however, was in keeping with the apostle’s assertion concerning
virginity, of which Paul writes: ‘I have no commandment of the Lord.’”1685 Upon
this the synod said: “This also the Church receives.” I have read for myself the meaning
which Coelestius gives to this in his book,—for he does not deny that the book is his. Now
he made this statement obviously with the view of persuading us that we possess through
the nature of free will so great an ability for avoiding sin, that we are able to do more than
is commanded us; for a perpetual virginity is maintained by very many persons, and this is
not commanded; whereas, in order to avoid sin, it is sufficient to fulfil what is commanded.
When the judges, however, accepted Pelagius’ answer, they did not take it to convey the
idea that those persons keep all the commandments of the law and the gospel who over and
above maintain the state of virginity, which is not commanded,—but only this, that virginity,
which is not commanded, is something more than conjugal chastity, which is commanded;
so that to observe the one is of course more than to keep the other; whereas, at the same
time, neither can be maintained without the grace of God, inasmuch as the apostle, in
speaking of this very subject, says: “But I would that all men were even as I myself. Every
man, however, hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.”1686
And even the Lord Himself, upon the disciples remarking, “If the case of the man be so with
his wife, it is not expedient to marry” (or, as it may be better expressed in Latin, “it is not
expedient to take a wife”),1687 said to them: “All men cannot receive this saying, save they
to whom it is given.”1688 This, therefore, is the doctrine which the bishops of the synod declared
to be received by the Church, that the state of virginity, persevered in to the last,
which is not commanded, is more than the chastity of married life, which is commanded.
In what view Pelagius or Coelestius regarded this subject, the judges were not aware.</p>

<p>The Tenth Item in the Accusation. The More Prominent Points
of Coelestius’ Work Continued.</p>
<p>After this we find objected against Pelagius some other points of Coelestius’ teaching,—
prominent ones, and undoubtedly worthy of condemnation; such, indeed, as would
certainly have involved Pelagius in condemnation, if he had not anathematized them in the
synod. Under his third head Coelestius was alleged to have written: “That God’s grace and
assistance is not given for single actions, but is imparted in the freedom of the will, or in the
law and in doctrine.” And again: “That God’s grace is given in proportion to our deserts;
because, were He to give it to sinful persons, He would seem to be unrighteous.” And from
these words he inferred that “therefore grace itself has been placed in my will, according as
I have been either worthy or unworthy of it. For if we do all things by grace, then whenever
we are overcome by sin, it is not we who are overcome, but God’s grace, which wanted by
all means to help us, but was not able.” And once more he says: “If, when we conquer sin,
it is by the grace of God; then it is He who is in fault whenever we are conquered by sin,
because He was either altogether unable or unwilling to keep us safe.” To these charges
Pelagius replied: “Whether these are really the opinions of Coelestius or not, is the concern
of those who say that they are. For my own part, indeed, I never entertained such views; on
the contrary, I anathematize every one who does entertain them.” Then the synod said:
“This holy synod accepts you for your condemnation of these impious words.” Now certainly
there can be no mistake, in regard to these opinions, either as to the clear way in which
Pelagius pronounced on them his anathema, or as to the absolute terms in which the bishops
condemned them. Whether Pelagius or Coelestius, or both of them, or neither of them, or
other persons with them or in their name, have ever held or still hold these sentiments,—may
be doubtful or obscure; but nevertheless by this judgment of the bishops it has been declared
plainly enough that they have been condemned, and that Pelagius would have been condemned
along with them, unless he had himself condemned them too. Now, after this trial,
it is certain that whenever we enter on a controversy touching opinions of this kind, we only
discuss an already condemned heresy.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.</head>
<p>Remarks on the Tenth Item.</p>
<p>I shall make my next remark with greater satisfaction. In a former section I expressed
a fear1689 that, when Pelagius said that “a man was able by the help of God’s grace to live
without sin,” he perhaps meant by the term “grace” the capability possessed by nature as
created by God with a free will, as it is understood in that book which I received as his and
to which I replied;1690 and that by these means he was deceiving the judges, who were ignorant
of the circumstances. Now, however, since he anathematizes those persons who hold
that “God’s grace and assistance is not given for single actions, but is imparted in the freedom
of the will, or in the law and in doctrine,” it is quite evident that he really means the grace
which is preached in the Church of Christ, and is conferred by the ministration of the Holy
Ghost for the purpose of helping us in our single actions, whence it is that we pray for
needful and suitable grace that we enter not into any temptation. Nor, again, have I any
longer a fear that, when he said, “No man can be without sin unless he has acquired a
knowledge of the law,” and added this explanation of his words, that “he posited in the
knowledge of the law, help towards the avoidance of sin,”1691 he at all meant the said
knowledge to be considered as tantamount to the grace of God; for, observe, he anathematizes
such as hold this opinion. See, too, how he refuses to hold our natural free will, or the law
and doctrine, as equivalent to that grace of God which helps us through our single actions.
What else then is left to him but to understand that grace which the apostle tells us is given
by “the supply of the Spirit?”1692 and concerning which the Lord said: “Take no thought
how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”1693 Nor,
again, need I be under any apprehension that, when he asserted, “All men are ruled by their
own will,” and afterwards explained that he had made that statement “in the interest of the
freedom of our will, of which God is the helper whenever it makes choice of good,”1694 that
he perhaps here also held God’s helping grace as synonymous with our natural free will and
the teaching of the law. For inasmuch as he rightly anathematized the persons who hold
that God’s grace or assistance is not given for single actions, but lies in the gift of free will,
or in the law and doctrine, it follows, of course, that God’s grace or assistance is given us
for single actions,—free will, or the law and the doctrine, being left out of consideration;

and thus through all the single actions of our life, when we act rightly, we are ruled and

<p>The Eleventh Item of the Accusation.</p>
<p>But what comes afterwards again fills me with anxiety. On its being objected to him,
from the fifth chapter of Coelestius’ book, that “they say that every individual has the ability
to possess all powers and graces, thus taking away that ‘diversity of graces,’ which the apostle
teaches,” Pelagius replied: “We have certainly said so much; but yet they have laid against
us a malignant and blundering charge. We do not take away the diversity of graces; but we
declare that God gives to the person, who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all
graces, even as He conferred them on the Apostle Paul.” Hereupon the Synod said: “You
accordingly do yourself hold the doctrine of the Church touching the gift of the graces,
which are collectively possessed by the apostle.” Here some one may say, “Why then is he
anxious? Do you on your side deny that all the powers and graces were combined in the
apostle?” For my own part, indeed, if all those are to be understood which the apostle has
himself mentioned together in one passage,—as, I suppose, the bishops understood Pelagius
to mean when they approved of his answer, and pronounced it to be in keeping with the
sense of the Church,—then I do not doubt that the apostle had them all; for he says: “And
God hath set some in the Church, first, apostles; secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers;
after that miracles; then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.”1696
What then? shall we say that the Apostle Paul did not possess all these gifts himself? Who
would be bold enough to assert this? The very fact that he was an apostle showed, of course,
that he possessed the grace of the apostolate. He possessed also that of prophecy; for was
not that a prophecy of his in which he says: “In the last times some shall depart from the
faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils?”1697 He was, moreover, “the
teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.”1698 He performed miracles also and cures; for
he shook off from his hand, unhurt, the biting viper;1699 and the cripple stood upright on
his feet at the apostle’s word, and his strength was at once restored.1700 It is not clear what
he means by helps, for the term is of very wide application; but who can say that he was
wanting even in this grace, when through his labours such helps were manifestly afforded
towards the salvation of mankind? Then as to his possessing the grace of “government,”
what could be more excellent than his administration, when the Lord at that time governed
so many churches by his personal agency, and governs them still in our day through his
epistles? And in respect of the “diversities of tongues,” what tongues could have been wanting
to him, when he says himself: “I thank my God that I speak with tongues more than you

all?”1701 It being thus inevitable to suppose that not one of these was wanting to the Apostle
Paul, the judges approved of Pelagius’ answer, wherein he said “that all graces were conferred
upon him.” But there are other graces in addition to these which are not mentioned here.
For it is not to be supposed, however greatly the Apostle Paul excelled others as a member
of Christ’s body, that the very Head itself of the entire body did not receive more and ampler
graces still, whether in His flesh or His soul as man; for such a created nature did the Word
of God assume as His own into the unity of His Person, that He might be our Head, and we
His body. And in very deed, if all gifts could be in each member, it would be evident that
the similitude, which is used to illustrate this subject, of the several members of our body
is inapplicable; for some things are common to the members in general, such as life and
health, whilst other things are peculiar to the separate members, since the ear has no perception
of colours, nor the eye of voices. Hence it is written: “If the whole body were an eye,
where were the hearing? if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?”1702 Now this
of course is not said as if it were impossible for God to impart to the ear the sense of seeing,
or to the eye the function of hearing. However, what He does in Christ’s body, which is the
Church, and what the apostle meant by diversity of graces1703 as if through the different
members, there might be gifts proper even to every one separately, is clearly known. Why,
too, and on what ground they who raised the objection were so unwilling to have taken
away all difference in graces, why, moreover, the bishops of the synod were able to approve
of the answer given by Pelagius in deference to the Apostle Paul, in whom we admit the
combination of all those graces which he mentioned in the one particular passage, is by this
time clear also.</p>

<head>Chapter 33.</head>
<p>Discussion of the Eleventh Item Continued.</p>
<p>What, then, is the reason why, as I said just now, I felt anxious on the subject of this
head of his doctrine? It is occasioned by what Pelagius says in these words: “That God gives
to the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces, even as He conferred
them on the Apostle Paul.” Now, I should not have felt any anxiety about this answer of
Pelagius, if it were not closely connected with the cause which we are bound to guard with
the utmost care—even that God’s grace may never be attacked, while we are silent or dissembling
in respect of so great an evil. As, therefore, he does not say, that God gives to whom
He will, but that “God gives to the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all
these graces,” I could not help being suspicious, when I read such words. For the very name
of grace, and the thing that is meant by it, is taken away, if it is not bestowed gratuitously,
but he only receives it who is worthy of it. Will anybody say that I do the apostle wrong,
because I do not admit him to have been worthy of grace? Nay, I should indeed rather do
him wrong, and bring on myself a punishment, if I refused to believe what he himself says.
Well, now, has he not pointedly so defined grace as to show that it is so called because it is
bestowed gratuitously? These are his own very words: “And if by grace, then is it no more
of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.”1704 In accordance with this, he says again:
“Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.”1705 Whosoever,
therefore, is worthy, to him it is due; and if it is thus due to him, it ceases to be grace; for
grace is given, but a debt is paid. Grace, therefore, is given to those who are unworthy, that
a debt may be paid to them when they become worthy. He, however, who has bestowed on
the unworthy the gifts which they possessed not before, does Himself take care that they
shall have whatever things He means to recompense to them when they become worthy.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—The Same Continued. On the Works of Unbelievers; Faith is the Initial
Principle from Which Good Works Have Their Beginning; Faith is the Gift of
God’s Grace.</head>
<p>He will perhaps say to this: “It was not because of his works, but in consequence of his
faith, that I said the apostle was worthy of having all those great graces bestowed upon him.
His faith deserved this distinction, but not his works, which were not previously good.”
Well, then, are we to suppose that faith does not work? Surely faith does work in a very real
way, for it “worketh by love.”1706 Preach up, however, as much as you like, the works of
unbelieving men, we still know how true and invincible is the statement of this same apostle:
“Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”1707 The very reason, indeed, why he so often declares
that righteousness is imputed to us, not out of our works, but our faith, whereas faith rather
works through love, is that no man should think that he arrives at faith itself through the
merit of his works; for it is faith which is the beginning whence good works first proceed;
since (as has already been stated) whatsoever comes not from faith is sin. Accordingly, it is
said to the Church, in the Song of Songs: “Thou shalt come and pass by from the beginning
of faith.”1708 Although, therefore, faith procures the grace of producing good works, we
certainly do not deserve by any faith that we should have faith itself; but, in its bestowal
upon us, in order that we may follow the Lord by its help, “His mercy has prevented us.”1709
Was it we ourselves that gave it to us? Did we ourselves make ourselves faithful? I must by
all means say here, emphatically: “It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.”1710
And indeed nothing else than this is pressed upon us in the apostle’s teaching, when he says:
“For I declare, through the grace that is given unto me, to every man that is among you, not
to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as
God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”1711 Whence, too, arises the well-known
challenge: “What hast thou that thou didst not receive?”1712 inasmuch as we have received
even that which is the spring from which everything we have of good in our actions takes
its beginning.</p>

<p>“What, then, is the meaning of that which the same apostle says: ‘I have fought a good
fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day;’1713
if these are not recompenses paid to the worthy, but gifts, bestowed on the unworthy?” He
who says this, does not consider that the crown could not have been given to the man who
is worthy of it, unless grace had been first bestowed on him whilst unworthy of it. He says
indeed: “I have fought a good fight;”1714 but then he also says: “Thanks be to God, who
giveth us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord.”1715 He says too: “I have finished my
course;” but he says again: “It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
that showeth mercy.”1716 He says, moreover: “I have kept the faith;” but then it is he too
who says again: “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep
my deposit against that day”—that is, “my commendation;” for some copies have not the
word depositum, but commendatum, which yields a plainer sense.1717 Now, what do we
commend to God’s keeping, except the things which we pray Him to preserve for us, and
amongst these our very faith? For what else did the Lord procure for the Apostle Peter by
His prayer for him,1718 of which He said, “I have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail
not,”1719 than that God would preserve his faith, that it should not fail by giving way to
temptation? Therefore, blessed Paul, thou great preacher of grace, I will say it without fear
of any man (for who will be less angry with me for so saying than thyself, who hast told us
what to say, and taught us what to teach?)—I will, I repeat, say it, and fear no man for the
assertion: Their own crown is recompensed to their merits; but thy merits are the gifts of
God!</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—The Same Continued. The Monk Pelagius. Grace is Conferred on the
Unworthy.</head>
<p>His due reward, therefore, is recompensed to the apostle as worthy of it; but still it was
grace which bestowed on him the apostleship itself, which was not his due, and of which he
was not worthy. Shall I be sorry for having said this? God forbid! For under his own testimony
shall I find a ready protection from such reproach; nor will any man charge me with audacity,
unless he be himself audacious enough to charge the apostle with mendacity. He frankly
says, nay he protests, that he commends the gifts of God within himself, so that he glories
not in himself at all, but in the Lord;1720 he not only declares that he possessed no good
deserts in himself why he should be made an apostle, but he even mentions his own demerits,
in order to manifest and preach the grace of God. “I am not meet,” says he, “to be called an
apostle;”1721 and what else does this mean than “I am not worthy”—as indeed several Latin
copies read the phrase. Now this, to be sure, is the very gist of our question; for undoubtedly
in this grace of apostleship all those graces are contained. For it was neither convenient nor
right that an apostle should not possess the gift of prophecy, nor be a teacher, nor be illustrious
for miracles and the gifts of healings, nor furnish needful helps, nor provide governments
over the churches, nor excel in diversities of tongues. All these functions the one name of
apostleship embraces. Let us, therefore, consult the man himself, nay listen wholly to him.
Let us say to him: “Holy Apostle Paul, the monk Pelagius declares that thou wast worthy to
receive all the graces of thine apostleship. What dost thou say thyself?” He answers: “I am
not worthy to be called an apostle.” Shall I then, under pretence of honouring Paul, in a
matter concerning Paul, dare to believe Pelagius in preference to Paul? I will not do so; for
if I did, I should only prove to be more onerous to myself than honouring to him.1722 Let
us hear also why he is not worthy to be called an apostle: “Because,” says he, “I persecuted
the Church of God.”1723 Now, were we to follow up the idea here expressed, who would
not judge that he rather deserved from Christ condemnation, instead of an apostolic call?
Who could so love the preacher as not to loathe the persecutor? Well, therefore, and truly
does he say of himself: “I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the
Church of God.” As thou wroughtest then such evil, how camest thou to earn such good?
Let all men hear his answer: “But by the grace of God, I am what I am.” Is there, then, no
other way in which grace is commended, than because it is conferred on an unworthy recipient?
“And His grace,” he adds, “which was bestowed on me was not in vain.”1724 He says
<note type="footnote">1720 1 Cor. i. 31.</note>
<note type="footnote">1721 1 Cor. xv. 9.</note>

this as a lesson to others also, to show the freedom of the will, when he says: “We then, as
workers together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.”1725
Whence however does he derive his proof, that “His grace bestowed on himself was not in
vain,” except from the fact which he goes on to mention: “But I laboured more abundantly
than they all?”1726 So it seems he did not labour in order to receive grace, but he received
grace in order that he might labour. And thus, when unworthy, he gratuitously received
grace, whereby he might become worthy to receive the due reward. Not that he ventured
to claim even his labour for himself; for, after saying: “I laboured more abundantly than
they all,” he at once subjoined: “Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.”1727 O
mighty teacher, confessor, and preacher of grace! What meaneth this: “I laboured more, yet
not I?” Where the will exalted itself ever so little, there piety was instantly on the watch, and
humility trembled, because weakness recognised itself.</p>

had taken place before him previous to the trial.1728 He told them that “on the
occasion in question, whilst some were whispering, and remarking on Pelagius’ statement,
that ‘without God’s grace man was able to attain perfection’ (that is, as he had previously
expressed it, ‘man was able to be without sin’), he censured the statement, and reminded
them besides, that even the Apostle Paul, after so many labours—not indeed in his own
strength, but by the grace of God—said: ‘I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not
I, but the grace of God that was with me;’1729 and again: ‘It is not of him that willeth, nor
of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy;’1730 and again: ‘Except the Lord build
the house, they labour but in vain who build it.’1731 And,” he added, “we quoted several
other like passages out of the Holy Scriptures. When, however, they did not receive the
quotations which we made out of the Holy Scriptures, but continued their murmuring noise,
Pelagius said: ‘This is what I also believe; let him be anathema, who declares that a man is
able, without God’s help, to arrive at the perfection of all virtues.’”</p>

mind of the apostle, and mentioned it for the very purpose of hindering Pelagius from
thinking that any man can avoid sin without God’s grace, and declared that Pelagius said
in answer: “This is what I also believe,” and did not, upon hearing all this, repudiate his
admission by replying: “This is not my belief.” He ought, indeed, either to deny altogether,
or unhesitatingly to correct and amend this perverse exposition, in which he would have it,
that the apostle must not be regarded as entertaining the sentiment, 1734 but rather as refuting
it. Now, whatever Bishop John said of our brethren who were absent—whether our brother
bishops Heros and Lazarus, or the presbyter Orosius, or any others whose names are not
there registered,1735—I am sure that he did not mean it to operate to their prejudice. For,
had they been present, they might possibly (I am far from saying it absolutely) have convicted
him of untruth; at any rate they might perhaps have reminded him of something he had
forgotten, or something in which he might have been deceived by the Latin interpreter—not,
to be sure, for the purpose of misleading him by untruth, but at least, owing to some difficulty
occasioned by a foreign language, only imperfectly understood; especially as the question
was not treated in the Proceedings,1736 which were drawn up for the useful purpose of
preventing deceit on the part of evil men, and of preserving a record to assist the memory
of good men. If, however, any man shall be disposed by this mention of our brethren to introduce
any question or doubt on the subject, and summon them before the Episcopal
judgment, they will not be wanting to themselves, as occasion shall serve. Why need we here
pursue the point, when not even the judges themselves, after the narrative of our brother
bishop, were inclined to pronounce any definite sentence in consequence of it?</p>

<head>Chapter 40 [XVII.]—The Same Continued.</head>
<p>Since, then, Pelagius was present when these passages of the Scriptures were discussed,
and by his silence acknowledged having said that he entertained the same view of their
meaning, how happens it, that, after reconsidering the apostle’s testimony, as he had just
done, and finding that he said: “I am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted
the Church of God; but by the grace of God I am what I am,”1737 he did not perceive that
it was improper for him to say, respecting the question of the abundance of the graces which
the said apostle received, that he had shown himself “worthy to receive them,” when the
apostle himself not only confessed, but added a reason to prove, that he was unworthy of
them—and by this very fact set forth grace as grace indeed? If he could not for some reason
or other consider or recollect the narrative of his holiness the bishop John, which he had
heard some time before, he might surely have respected his own very recent answer at the
synod, and remembered how he anathematized, but a short while before, the opinions which
had been alleged against him out of Coelestius. Now among these it was objected to him
that Coelestius had said: “That the grace of God is bestowed according to our merits.” If,
then, Pelagius truthfully anathematized this, why does he say that all those graces were
conferred on the apostle because he deserved them? Is the phrase “worthy to receive” of
different meaning from the expression “to receive according to merit”? Can he by any disputatious
subtlety show that a man is worthy who has no merit? But neither Coelestius, nor
any other, all of whose opinions he anathematized, has any intention to allow him to throw
clouds over the phrase, and to conceal himself behind them. He presses home the matter,
and plainly says: “And this grace has been placed in my will, according as I have been either
worthy or unworthy of it.” If, then, a statement, wherein it is declared that “God’s grace is
given in proportion to our deserts, to such as are worthy,”1738 was rightly and truly condemned
by Pelagius, how could his heart permit him to think, or his mouth to utter, such
a sentence as this: “We say that God gives to the person who has proved himself worthy to
receive them, all graces?”1739 Who that carefully considers all this can help feeling some
anxiety about his answer or defence?</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—Augustin Indulgently Shows that the Judges Acted Incautiously in
Their Official Conduct of the Case of Pelagius.</head>
<p>Why, then (some one will say), did the judges approve of this? I confess that I hardly
even now understand why they did. It is, however, not to be wondered at, if some brief word
or phrase too easily escaped their attention and ear; or if, because they thought it capable
of being somehow interpreted in a correct sense, from seeming to have from the accused
himself such clear confessions of truth on the subject, they decided it to be hardly worth
while to excite a discussion about a word. The same feeling might have occurred to ourselves
also, if we had sat with them at the trial. For if, instead of the term worthy, the word predestinated
had been used, or some such word, my mind would certainly not have entertained
any doubt, much less have been disquieted by it; and yet if it were asserted, that he who is
justified by the election of grace is called worthy, through no antecedent merits of good indeed,
but by destination, just as he is called “elect,” it would be really difficult to determine
whether he might be so designated at all, or at least without some offence to an intelligent
view of the subject.</p>
<p>As for myself, indeed, I might readily pass on from the discussion on this word, were
it not that the treatise which called forth my reply, and in which he says that there is no
God’s grace at all except our own nature gratuitously created1740 with free will, made me
suspicious and anxious about the actual meaning of Pelagius—whether he had procured
the introduction of the term into the argument without any accurate intention as to its sense,
or else as a carefully drawn dogmatic expression. The last remaining statements had such
an effect on the judges, that they deemed them worthy of condemnation, without waiting
for Pelagius’ answer.</p>

<head>Chapter 42 <del>XVIII.</del>—The Twelfth Item in the Accusation. Other Heads of Coelestius’
Doctrine Abjured by Pelagius.</head>
<p>For it was objected that in the sixth chapter of Coelestius’ work there was laid down this
position: “Men cannot be called sons of God, unless they have become entirely free from
all sin.” It follows from this statement, that not even the Apostle Paul is a child of God, since
he said: “Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect.”1741 In the seventh
chapter he makes this statement: “Forgetfulness and ignorance have no connection with
sin, as they do not happen through the will, but through necessity;” although David says:
“Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my sins of ignorance;”1742 although too, in the
law, sacrifices are offered for ignorance, as if for sin.1743 In his tenth chapter he says: “Our
will is free, if it needs the help of God; inasmuch as every one in the possession of his proper
will has either something to do or to abstain from doing.” In the twelfth he says: “Our victory
comes not from God’s help, but from our own free will.” And this is a conclusion which he
was said to draw in the following terms: “The victory is ours, seeing that we took up arms
of our own will; just as, on the other hand, being conquered is our own, since it was of our
own will that we neglected to arm ourselves.” And, after quoting the phrase of the Apostle
Peter, “partakers of the divine nature,”1744 he is said to have made out of it this argument:
“Now if our spirit or soul is unable to be without sin, then even God is subject to sin, since
this part of Him, that is to say, the soul, is exposed to sin.” In his thirteenth chapter he says:
“That pardon is not given to penitents according to the grace and mercy of God, but according
to their own merits and effort, since through repentance they have been worthy of
mercy.”</p>

condemns the whole, as does also God’s Holy Catholic Church.” Pelagius answered: “I say
again, that these opinions, even according to their own testimony, are not mine; nor for
them, as I have already said, ought I to be held responsible. The opinions which I have
confessed to be my own, I maintain are sound; those, however, which I have said are not
my own, I reject according to the judgment of this holy synod, pronouncing anathema on
every man who opposes and gainsays the doctrines of the Holy Catholic Church. For I believe
in the Trinity of the one substance, and I hold all things in accordance with the teaching of
the Holy Catholic Church. If indeed any man entertains opinions different from her, let
him be anathema.”</p>

consent to the pious doctrines, and even anathematizes everything that is contrary to the
Church’s faith, we confess him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.”</p>

<head>Chapter 45 [XXI.]—Pelagius’ Acquittal Becomes Suspected.</head>
<p>If these are the proceedings by which Pelagius’ friends rejoice that he was exculpated,
we, on our part,—since he certainly took much pains to prove that we were well affected
towards him, by going so far as to produce even our private letters to him, and reading them
at the trial,—undoubtedly wish and desire his salvation in Christ; but as regards his exculpation,
which is rather believed than clearly shown, we ought not to be in a hurry to exult.
When I say this, indeed, I do not charge the judges either with negligence or connivance,
or with consciously holding unsound doctrine—which they most certainly would be the
very last to entertain. But although by their sentence Pelagius is held by those who are on
terms of fullest and closest intimacy with him to have been deservedly acquitted, with the
approval and commendation of his judges, he certainly does not appear to me to have been
cleared of the charges brought against him. They conducted his trial as of one whom they
knew nothing of, especially in the absence of those who had prepared the indictment against
him, and were quite unable to examine him with diligence and care; but, in spite of this inability,
they completely destroyed the heresy itself, as even the defenders of his perverseness
must allow, if they only follow the judgment through its particulars. As for those persons,
however, who well know what Pelagius has been in the habit of teaching, or who have had
to oppose his contentious efforts, or those who, to their joy, have escaped from his erroneous
doctrine, how can they possibly help suspecting him, when they read the affected confession,
wherein he acknowledges past errors, but so expresses himself as if he had never entertained
any other opinion than those which he stated in his replies to the satisfaction of the judges?</p>

<head>Chapter 46 <del>XXII.</del>—How Pelagius Became Known to Augustin; Coelestius Condemned
at Carthage.</head>
<p>Now, that I may especially refer to my own relation to him, I first became acquainted
with Pelagius’ name, along with great praise of him, at a distance, and when he was living
at Rome. Afterwards reports began to reach us, that he disputed against the grace of God.
This caused me much pain, for I could not refuse to believe the statements of my informants;
but yet I was desirous of ascertaining information on the matter either from himself or from
some treatise of his, that, in case I should have to discuss the question with him, it should
be on grounds which he could not disown. On his arrival, however, in Africa, he was in my
absence kindly received on our coast of Hippo, where, as I found from our brethren, nothing
whatever of this kind was heard from him; because he left earlier than was expected. On a
subsequent occasion, indeed, I caught a glimpse of him, once or twice, to the best of my recollection,
when I was very much occupied in preparing for the conference which we were
to hold with the heretical Donatists; but he hastened away across the sea. Meanwhile the
doctrines connected with his name were warmly maintained, and passed from mouth to
mouth, among his reputed followers—to such an extent that Coelestius found his way before
an ecclesiastical tribunal, and reported opinions well suited to his perverse character. We
thought it would be a better way of proceeding against them, if, without mentioning any
names of individuals, the errors themselves were met and refuted; and the men might thus
be brought to a right mind by the fear of a condemnation from the Church rather than be
punished by the actual condemnation. And so both by books and by popular discussions
we ceased not to oppose the evil doctrines in question.</p>

<head>Chapter 47 <del>XXIII.</del>—Pelagius’ Book, Which Was Sent by Timasius and Jacobus to
Augustin, Was Answered by the Latter in His Work “On Nature and Grace.”</head>
<p>But when there was actually placed in my hands, by those faithful servants of God and
honourable men, Timasius and Jacobus, the treatise in which Pelagius dealt with the question
of God’s grace, it became very evident to me—too evident, indeed, to admit of any further
doubt—how hostile to salvation by Christ was his poisonous perversion of the truth. He
treated the subject in the shape of an objection started, as if by an opponent, in his own
terms against himself; for he was already suffering a good deal of obloquy from his opinions
on the question, which he now appeared to solve for himself in no other way than by simply
describing the grace of God as nature created with a free will, occasionally combining
therewith either the help of the law, or even the remission of sins; although these additional
admissions were not plainly made, but only sparingly suggested by him. And yet, even under
these circumstances, I refrained from inserting Pelagius’ name in my work, wherein I refuted
this book of his; for I still thought that I should render a prompter assistance to the truth if
I continued to preserve a friendly relation to him, and so to spare his personal feelings, while
at the same time I showed no mercy, as I was bound not to show it, to the productions of
his pen. Hence, I must say, I now feel some annoyance, that in this trial he somewhere said:
“I anathematize those who hold these opinions, or have at any time held them.” He might
have been contented with saying, “Those who hold these opinions,” which we should have
regarded in the light of a self-censure; but when he went on to say, “Or have at any time
held them,” in the first place, how could he dare to condemn so unjustly those harmless
persons who no longer hold the errors, which they had learnt either from others, or actually
from himself? And, in the second place, who among all those persons that were aware of
the fact of his not only having held the opinions in question, but of his having taught them,
could help suspecting, and not unreasonably, that he must have acted insincerely in condemning
those who now hold those opinions, seeing that he did not hesitate to condemn
in the same strain and at the same moment those also who had at any time previously held
them, when they would be sure to remember that they had no less a person than himself as
their instructor in these errors? There are, for instance, such persons as Timasius and Jacobus,
to say nothing of any others. How can he with unblushing face look at them, his dear friends
(who have never relinquished their love of him) and his former disciples? These are the
persons to whom I addressed the work in which I replied to the statements of his book. I
think I ought not to pass over in silence the style and tone which they observed towards me
in their correspondence, and I have here added a letter of theirs as a sample.</p>

<head>Chapter 48 <del>XXIV.</del>—A Letter Written by Timasius and Jacobus to Augustin on
Receiving His Treatise “On Nature and Grace.”</head>
<p>“To his lordship, the truly blessed and deservedly venerable father, Bishop Augustin,
Timasius and Jacobus send greeting in the Lord. We have been so greatly refreshed and
strengthened by the grace of God, which your word has ministered to us, my lord, our truly
blessed and justly venerated father, that we may with the utmost sincerity and propriety
say, ‘He sent His word and healed them.’1745 We have found, indeed, that your holiness has
so thoroughly sifted the contents of his little book as to astonish us with the answers with
which even the slightest points of his error have been confronted, whether it be on matters
which every Christian ought to rebut, loathe, and avoid, or on those in which he is not with
sufficient certainty found to have erred,—although even in these he has, with incredible
subtlety, suggested his belief that God’s grace should be kept out of sight.1746 There is,
however, one consideration which affects us under so great a benefit,—that this most illustrious
gift of the grace of God has, however slowly, so fully shone out upon us. If, indeed,
it has happened that some are removed from the influence of this clearest light of truth,
whose blindness required its illumination, yet even to them, we doubt not, the same grace
will find its steady way, however late, by the merciful favour of that God ‘who will have all
men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.’1747 As for ourselves, indeed,
thanks to that loving spirit which is in you, we have, in consequence of your instruction,
some time since thrown off our subjection to his errors; but we still have even now cause
for continued gratitude in the fact that, as we have been informed, the false opinions which
we formerly believed are now becoming apparent to others—a way of escape opening out
to them in the extremely precious discourse of your holiness.” Then, in another hand: “May
the mercy of our God keep your blessedness in safety, and mindful of us, for His eternal
glory.”1748</p>

<p>If now that man,1749 too, were to confess that he had once been implicated in this error
as a person possessed, but that he now anathematized all that hold these opinions, whoever
should withhold his congratulation from him, now that he was in possession of the way of
truth, would surely surrender all the bowels of love. As the case, however, now stands, he
has not only not acknowledged his liberation from his pestilential error; but, as if that were
a small thing, he has gone on to anathematize men who have reached that freedom, who
love him so well that they would fain desire his own emancipation. Amongst these are those
very men who have expressed their good-will towards him in the letter, which they forwarded
to me. For he it was whom they had chiefly in view when they said how much they were
affected at the fact of my having at last written that work. “If, indeed, it has happened,” they
say, “that some are removed from the influence of this clearest light of truth, whose blindness
required its illumination, yet even to them,” they go on to remark, “we doubt not, the selfsame
grace will find its way, by the merciful favour of God.” Any name, or names, even they,
too, thought it desirable as yet to suppress, in order that, if friendship still lived on, the error
of the friends might the more surely die.</p>

in which, by mentioning his name, we shall open the wound in order to cure it, than for

result which causes us regret. Should he, however, feel angry with us, let him reflect how
unfair such anger is; and, in order to subdue it, let him ask God to give him that grace which,
in this trial, he has confessed to be necessary for each one of our actions, that so by His assistance
he may gain a real victory. For of what use to him are all those great laudations
contained in the letters of the bishops, which he thought fit to be mentioned, and even to
be read and quoted in his favour,—as if all those persons who heard his strong and, to some
extent, earnest exhortations to goodness of life could not have easily discovered how perverse

<head>Chapter 51 <del>XXVI.</del>—The Nature of Augustin’s Letter to Pelagius.</head>
<p>For my own part, indeed, in my letter which he produced, I not only abstained from all
praises of him, but I even exhorted him, with as much earnestness as I could, short of actually
mooting the question, to cultivate right views about the grace of God. In my salutation I
called him “lord”1750—a title which, in our epistolary style, we usually apply even to some
persons who are not Christians,—and this without untruth, inasmuch as we do, in a certain
sense, owe to all such persons a service, which is yet freedom, to help them in obtaining the
salvation which is in Christ. I added the epithet “most beloved;” and as I now call him by
this term, so shall I continue to do so, even if he be angry with me; because, if I ceased to
retain my love towards him, because of his feeling the anger, I should only injure myself
rather than him. I, moreover, styled him “most longed for,” because I greatly longed to have
a conversation with him in person; for I had already heard that he was endeavouring publicly
to oppose grace, whereby we are justified, whenever any mention was made of it. The brief
contents of the letter itself indeed show all this; for, after thanking him for the pleasure he
gave me by the information of his own health and that of his friends (whose bodily health
we are bound of course to wish for, however much we may desire their amendment in other
respects), I at once expressed the hope that the Lord would recompense him with such
blessings as do not appertain to physical welfare, but which he used to think, and probably
still thinks, consist solely in the freedom of the will and his own power,—at the same time,
and for this reason, wishing him “eternal life.” Then again, remembering the many good
and kind wishes he had expressed for me in his letter, which I was answering, I went on to
beg of him, too, that he would pray for me, that the Lord would indeed make me such a
man as he believed me to be already; that so I might gently remind him, against the opinion
he was himself entertaining, that the very righteousness which he had thought worthy to
be praised in me was “not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.”1751 This is the substance of that short letter of mine, and such was my
purpose when I dictated it. This is a copy of it:</p>

yet cannot be insensible of the benevolent view you entertain towards my poor deserts; at
the same time requesting you to pray for me, that the Lord would make me such a man as
you suppose me to be already.” Then, in another hand, it follows: “Be mindful of us; may

<head>Chapter 53 <del>XXIX.</del>—Pelagius’ Use of Recommendations.</head>
<p>As to that which I placed in the postscript,—that he might “find favour with the Lord,”—I
intimated that this lay rather in His grace than in man’s sole will; for I did not make it the
subject either of exhortation, or of precept, or of instruction, but simply of my wish. But
just in the same way as I should, if I had exhorted or enjoined, or even instructed him, simply
have shown that all this appertained to free will, without, however, derogating from the
grace of God; so in like manner, when I expressed the matter in the way of a wish, I asserted
no doubt the grace of God, but at the same time I did not quench the liberty of the will.
Wherefore, then, did he produce this letter at the trial? If he had only from the beginning
entertained views in accordance with it, very likely he would not have been at all summoned
before the bishops by the brethren, who, with all their kindness of disposition, could yet not
help being offended with his perverse contentiousness. Now, however, as I have given on
my part an account of this letter of mine, so would they, whose epistles he quoted, explain
theirs also, if it were necessary;—they would tell us either what they thought, or what they
were ignorant of, or with what purpose they wrote to him. Pelagius, therefore, may boast
to his heart’s content of the friendship of holy men, he may read their letters recounting his
praises, he may produce whatever synodal acts he pleases to attest his own acquittal,—there
still stands against him the fact, proved by the testimony of competent witnesses, that he
has inserted in his books statements which are opposed to that grace of God whereby we
are called and justified; and unless he shall, after true confession, anathematize these statements,
and then go on to contradict them both in his writings and discussions, he will certainly
seem to all those who have a fuller knowledge of him to have laboured in vain in his

Had Been Approved by Fourteen Bishops.</head>
<p>For I will not be silent as to the transactions which took place after this trial, and which
rather augment the suspicion against him. A certain epistle found its way into our hands,
which was ascribed to Pelagius himself, writing to a friend of his, a presbyter, who had kindly
admonished him (as appears from the same epistle) not to allow any one to separate himself
from the body of the Church on his account. Among the other contents of this document,
which it would be both tedious and unnecessary to quote here, Pelagius says: “By the sentence
of fourteen bishops our statement was received with approbation, in which we affirmed that
‘a man is able to be without sin, and easily to keep the commandments of God, if he wishes.’
This sentence,” says he, “has filled the mouths of the gainsayers with confusion, and has
separated asunder the entire set which was conspiring together for evil.” Whether, indeed,
this epistle was really written by Pelagius, or was composed by somebody in his name, who
can fail to see, after what manner this error claims to have achieved a victory, even in the
judicial proceedings where it was refuted and condemned? Now, he has adduced the words
we have just quoted according to the form in which they occur in his book of “Chapters,”
as it is called, not in the shape in which they were objected to him at his trial, and even repeated
by him in his answer. For even his accusers, through some unaccountable inaccuracy,
left out a word in their indictment, concerning which there is no small controversy. They
made him say, that “a man is able to be without sin, if he wishes; and, if he wishes, to keep
the commandments of God.” There is nothing said here about this being “easily” done. Afterwards,
when he gave his answer, he spake thus: “We said, that a man is able to be without
sin, and to keep the commandments of God, if he wishes;” he did not then say, “easily keep,”
but only “keep.” So in another place, amongst the statements about which Hilary consulted
me, and I gave him my views, it was objected to Pelagius that he had said, “A man is able,
if he wishes, to live without sin.” To this he himself responded, “That a man is able to be
without sin has been said above.” Now, on this occasion, we do not find on the part either
of those who brought the objection or of him who rebutted it, that the word “easily” was
used at all. Then, again, in the narrative of the holy Bishop John, which we have partly
quoted above,1753 he says, “When they were importunate and exclaimed, ‘He is a heretic,
because he says, It is true that a man is able, if he only will, to live without sin;’ and then,
when we questioned him on this point, he answered, ‘I did not say that man’s nature has
received the power of being impeccable,—but I said, whosoever is willing, in the pursuit of
his own salvation, to labour and struggle to abstain from sinning and to walk in the commandments
of God, receives the ability to do so from God.’ Then, whilst some were whispering,
and remarking on the statement of Pelagius, that ‘without God’s grace man was able
<note type="footnote">1753 In 37 [XIV.]</note>

<pb n="623"/>
to attain perfection,’ I censured the statement, and reminded them, besides, that even the
Apostle Paul, after so many labours,—not, indeed, in his own strength, but by the grace of
God,—said, ‘I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God that
was with me.’”1754 And so on, as I have already mentioned.</p>

<head>Chapter 55.—Pelagius’ Letter Discussed.</head>
<p>What, then, is the meaning of those vaunting words of theirs in this epistle, wherein
they boast of having induced the fourteen bishops who sat in that trial to believe not merely
that a man has ability but that he has “facility” to abstain from sinning, according to the
position laid down in the “Chapters” of this same Pelagius,—when, in the draft of the proceedings,
notwithstanding the frequent repetition of the general charge and full consideration
bestowed on it, this is nowhere found? How, indeed, can this word fail to contradict the
very defence and answer which Pelagius made; since the Bishop John asserted that Pelagius
put in this answer in his presence, that “he wished it to be understood that the man who
was willing to labour and agonize for his salvation was able to avoid sin,” while Pelagius
himself, at this time engaged in a formal inquiry and conducting his defence,1755 said, that
“it was by his own labour and the grace of God that a man is able to be without sin?” Now,
is a thing easy when labour is required to effect it? For I suppose that every man would agree
with us in the opinion, that wherever there is labour there cannot be facility. And yet a carnal
epistle of windiness and inflation flies forth, and, outrunning in speed the tardy record of
the proceedings, gets first into men’s hands; so as to assert that fourteen bishops in the East
have determined, not only “that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep God’s commandments,”
but “easily to keep.” Nor is God’s assistance once named: it is merely said, “If he
wishes;” so that, of course, as nothing is affirmed of the divine grace, for which the earnest
fight was made, it remains that the only thing one reads of in this epistle is the unhappy and
self-deceiving—because represented as victorious—human pride. As if the Bishop John,
indeed, had not expressly declared that he censured this statement, and that, by the help of
three inspired texts of Scripture,1756 he had, as if by thunderbolts, struck to the ground the
gigantic mountains of such presumption which they had piled up against the still overtowering
heights of heavenly grace; or as if again those other bishops who were John’s assessors
could have borne with Pelagius, either in mind or even in ear, when he pronounced
these words: “We said that a man is able to be without sin and to keep the commandments
of God, if he wishes,” unless he had gone on at once to say: “For the ability to do this God
has given to him” (for they were unaware that he was speaking of nature, and not of that
grace which they had learnt from the teaching of the apostle); and had afterwards added
this qualification: “We never said, however, that any man could be found, who at no time
whatever from his infancy to his old age had committed sin, but that if any person were
converted from his sins, he could by his own exertion and the grace of God be without sin.”
Now, by the very fact that in their sentence they used these words, “he has answered correctly,
<note type="footnote">1755 Ch. 16. At the synod of Diospolis. The proceedings before John, bishop of Jerusalem, were not duly
registered. See above, 39.</note>
<note type="footnote">1756 See above, 37.</note>

<pb n="625"/>
‘that a man can, when he has the assistance and grace of God, be without sin;’” what else
did they fear than that, if he denied this, he would be doing a manifest wrong not to man’s
ability, but to God’s grace? It has indeed not been defined when a man may become without
sin; it has only been judicially settled, that this result can only be reached by the assisting
grace of God; it has not, I say, been defined whether a man, whilst he is in this flesh which
lusts against the Spirit, ever has been, or now is, or ever can be, by his present use of reason
and free will, either in the full society of man or in monastic solitude, in such a state as to
be beyond the necessity of offering up the prayer, not in behalf of others, but for himself
personally: “Forgive us our debts;”1757 or whether this gift shall be consummated at the
time when “we shall be like Him, when we shall see Him as He is,”1758—when it shall be
said, not by those that are fighting: “I see another law in my members, warring against the
law of my mind,”1759 but by those that are triumphing: “O death, where is thy victory? O
death, where is thy sting?”1760 Now, this is perhaps hardly a question which ought to be
discussed between catholics and heretics, but only among catholics with a view to a peaceful
settlement.1761</p>

<head>Chapter 56 <del>XXXI.</del>—Is Pelagius Sincere?</head>
<p>How, then, can it be believed that Pelagius (if indeed this epistle is his) could have been
sincere, when he acknowledged the grace of God, which is not nature with its free will, nor
the knowledge of the law, nor simply the forgiveness of sins, but a something which is necessary
to each of our actions; or could have sincerely anathematized everybody who entertained
the contrary opinion:—seeing that in his epistle he set forth even the ease wherewith
a man can avoid sinning (concerning which no question had arisen at this trial) just as if
the judges had come to an agreement to receive even this word, and said nothing about the
grace of God, by the confession and subsequent addition of which he escaped the penalty
of condemnation by the Church?</p>

<head>Chapter 57 [XXXII.]—Fraudulent Practices Pursued by Pelagius in His Report of
the Proceedings in Palestine, in the Paper Wherein He Defended Himself to
Augustin.</head>
<p>There is yet another point which I must not pass over in silence. In the paper containing
his defence which he sent to me by a friend of ours, one Charus, a citizen of Hippo, but a
deacon in the Eastern Church, he has made a statement which is different from what is
contained in the Proceedings of the Bishops. Now, these Proceedings, as regards their contents,
are of a higher and firmer tone, and more straightforward in defending the catholic
verity in opposition to this heretical pestilence. For, when I read this paper of his, previous
to receiving a copy of the Proceedings, I was not aware that he had made use of those words
which he had used at the trial, when he was present for himself; they are few, and there is
not much discrepancy, and they do not occasion me much anxiety. [XXXIII.] But I could
not help feeling annoyance that he can appear to have defended sundry sentences of
Coelestius, which, from the Proceedings, it is clear enough that he anathematized. Now,
some of these he disavowed for himself, simply remarking, that “he was not in any way re-
sponsible for them.” In his paper, however, he refused to anathematize these same opinions,
which are to this effect: “That Adam was created mortal, and that he would have died
whether he had sinned or not sinned. That Adam’s sin injured only himself, and not the
human race. That the law, no less than the gospel, leads us to the kingdom. That new-born
infants are in the same condition that Adam was before he fell. That, on the one hand, the
entire human race does not die owing to Adam’s death and transgression; nor, on the other
hand, does the whole human race rise again through the resurrection of Christ. That infants,
even if they die unbaptized, have eternal life. That rich men, even if they are baptized, unless
they renounce and give up all, have, whatever good they may seem to have done, nothing
of it reckoned to them; neither shall they possess the kingdom of heaven.” Now, in his paper,
the answer which he gives to all this is: “All these statements have not been made by me,
even on their own testimony, nor do I hold myself responsible for them.” In the Proceedings,
however, he expressed himself as follows on these points: “They have not been made by me,
as even their testimony shows, and for them I do not feel that I am at all responsible. But
yet, for the satisfaction of the holy synod, I anathematize those who either now hold, or have
ever held, them.” Now, why did he not express himself thus in his paper also? It would not,
I suppose, have cost much ink, or writing, or delay; nor have occupied much of the paper
itself, if he had done this. Who, however, can help believing that there is a purpose in all
this, to pass off this paper in all directions as an abridgment of the Episcopal Proceedings.
In consequence of which, men might think that his right still to maintain any of these
opinions which he pleased had not been taken away,—on the ground that they had been

<pb n="628"/>
simply laid to his charge but had not received his approbation, nor yet had been anathematized
and condemned by him.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="59">
<pb n="629"/>
<head>Chapter 58.—The Same Continued.</head>
<p>He has, moreover, in this same paper, huddled together afterwards many of the points
which were objected against him out of the “Chapters,” of Coelestius’ book; nor has he kept
distinct, at the intervals which separate them in the Proceedings, the two answers in which
he anathematized these very heads; but has substituted one general reply for them all. This,
I should have supposed, had been done for the sake of brevity, had I not perceived that he
had a very special object in the arrangement which disturbs us. For thus has he closed this
answer: “I say again, that these opinions, even according to their own testimony, are not
mine; nor, as I have already said, am I to be held responsible for them. The opinions which
I have confessed to be my own, I maintain are sound and correct; those, however, which I
have said are not my own, I reject according to the judgment of the holy Church, pronouncing
anathema on every man that opposes and gainsays the doctrines of the holy and catholic
Church; and likewise on those who by inventing false opinions have excited odium against
us.” This last paragraph the Proceedings do not contain; it has, however, no bearing on the
matter which causes us anxiety. By all means let them have his anathema who have excited
odium against him by their invention of false opinions. But, when first I read, “Those
opinions, however, which I have said are not my own, I reject in accordance with the judgment
of the holy Church,” being ignorant that any judgment had been arrived at on the
point by the Church, since there is here nothing said about it, and I had not then read the
Proceedings, I really thought that nothing else was meant than that he promised that he
would entertain the same view about the “Chapters” as the Church, which had not yet determined
the question, might some day decide respecting them; and that he was ready to
reject the opinions which the Church had not yet indeed rejected, but might one day have
occasion to reject; and that this, too, was the purport of what he further said: “Pronouncing
anathema on every man that opposes and gainsays the doctrines of the holy catholic Church.”
But in fact, as the Proceedings testify, a judgment of the Church had already been pronounced
on these subjects by the fourteen bishops; and it was in accordance with this judgment that
he professed to reject all these opinions, and to pronounce his anathema against those persons
who, by reason of the said opinions, were contravening the judgment which had already,
as the Proceedings show, been actually settled. For already had the judges asked: “What says
the monk Pelagius to all these heads of opinion which have been read in his presence? For
this holy synod condemns them, as does also God’s holy catholic Church.” Now, they who
know nothing of all this, and only read this paper of his, are led to suppose that some one
or other of these opinions may lawfully be maintained, as if they had not been determined
to be contrary to catholic doctrine, and as if Pelagius had declared himself to be ready to
hold the same sentiments concerning them which the Church had not as yet determined,
but might have to determine. He has not, therefore, expressed himself in this paper, to which
we have so often referred, straightforwardly enough for us to discover the fact, of which we

<pb n="630"/>
find a voucher in the Proceedings, that all those dogmas by means of which this heresy has
been stealing along and growing strong with contentious audacity, have been condemned
by fourteen bishops presiding in an ecclesiastical synod! Now, if he was afraid that this fact
would become known, as is the case, he has more reason for self-correction than for resentment
at the vigilance with which we are watching the controversy to the best of our ability,
however late. If, however, it is untrue that he had any such fears, and we are only indulging
in a suspicion which is natural to man, let him forgive us; but, at the same time, let him
continue to oppose and resist the opinions which were rejected by him with anathemas in
the proceedings before the bishops, when he was on his defence; for if he now shows any
leniency to them, he would seem not only to have believed these opinions formerly, but to
be cherishing them still.</p>

<head>Chapter 59 <del>XXXIV.</del>—Although Pelagius Was Acquitted, His Heresy Was Condemned.</head>
<p>Now, with respect to this treatise of mine, which perhaps is not unreasonably lengthy,
considering the importance and extent of its subject, I have wished to inscribe it to your
Reverence, in order that, if it be not displeasing to your mind, it may become known to such
persons as I have thought may stand in need of it under the recommendation of your authority,
which carries so much more weight than our own poor industry. Thus it may avail
to crush the vain and contentious thoughts of those persons who suppose that, because
Pelagius was acquited, those Eastern bishops who pronounced the judgment approved of
those dogmas which are beginning to shed very pernicious influences against the Christian
faith, and that grace of God whereby we are called and justified. These the Christian verity
never ceases to condemn, as indeed it condemned them even by the authoritative sentence
of the fourteen bishops; nor would it, on the occasion in question, have hesitated to condemn
Pelagius too, unless he had anathematized the heretical opinions with which he was charged.
But now, while we render to this man the respect of brotherly affection (and we have all
along expressed with all sincerity our anxiety for him and interest in him), let us observe,
with as much brevity as is consistent with accuracy of observation, that, notwithstanding
the undoubted fact of his having been acquitted by a human verdict, the heresy itself has
ever been held worthy of condemnation by divine judgment, and has actually been condemned
by the sentence of these fourteen bishops of the Eastern Church.</p>

<head>Chapter 60 <del>XXXV.</del>—The Synod’s Condemnation of His Doctrines.</head>
<p>This is the concluding clause of their judgment. The synod said: “Now forasmuch as
we have received satisfaction in these inquiries from the monk Pelagius, who has been
present, who yields assent to godly doctrines, and rejects and anathematizes those which
are contrary to the Church, we confess him still to belong to the communion of the catholic
Church.” Now, there are two facts concerning the monk Pelagius here contained with entire
perspicuity in this brief statement of the holy bishops who judged him: one, that “he yields
assent to godly doctrines;” the other, that “he rejects and anathematizes those which are
contrary to the Church.” On account of these two concessions, Pelagius was pronounced
to be “in the communion of the catholic Church.” Let us, in pursuit of our inquiry, briefly
recapitulate the entire facts, in order to discover what were the words he used which made
those two points so clear, as far as men were able at the moment to form a judgment as to
what were manifest points. For among the allegations which were made against him, he is
said to have rejected and anathematized, as “contrary,” all the statements which in his answer
he denied were his. Let us, then, summarize the whole case as far as we can.</p>

<p>Since it was necessary that the Apostle Paul’s prediction should be accomplished,—“There
must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest
among you,”1762—after the older heresies, there has been just now introduced, not by
bishops or presbyters or any rank of the clergy, but by certain would-be monks, a heresy
which disputes, under colour of defending free will, against the grace of God which we have
through our Lord Jesus Christ; and endeavours to overthrow the foundation of the Christian
faith of which it is written, “By one man, death, and by one man the resurrection of the
dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive;”1763 and denies God’s
help in our actions, by affirming that, “in order to avoid sin and to fulfil righteousness, human
nature can be sufficient, seeing that it has been created with free will; and that God’s grace
lies in the fact that we have been so created as to be able to do this by the will, and in the
further fact that God has given to us the assistance of His law and commandments, and also
in that He forgives their past sins when men turn to Him;” that “in these things alone is
God’s grace to be regarded as consisting, not in the help He gives to us for each of our actions,”—“
seeing that a man can be without sin, and keep God’s commandments easily if he
wishes.”</p>

<head>Chapter 62.—The History Continued. Coelestius Condemned at Carthage by Episcopal
Judgment. Pelagius Acquitted by Bishops in Palestine, in Consequence of
His Deceptive Answers; But Yet His Heresy Was Condemned by Them.</head>
<p>After this heresy had deceived a great many persons, and was disturbing the brethren
whom it had failed to deceive, one Coelestius, who entertained these sentiments, was brought
up for trial before the Church of Carthage, and was condemned by a sentence of the bishops.
1764 Then, a few years afterwards, Pelagius, who was said to have been this man’s instructor,
having been accused of holding his heresy, found also his way before an episcopal
tribunal.1765 The indictment was prepared against him by the Gallican bishops, Heros and
Lazarus, who were, however, not present at the proceedings, and were excused from attendance
owing to the illness of one of them. After all the charges were duly recited, and Pelagius
had met them by his answers, the fourteen bishops of the province of Palestine pronounced
him, in accordance with his answers, free from the perversity of this heresy; while yet without
hesitation condemning the heresy itself. They approved indeed of his answer to the objections,
that “a man is assisted by a knowledge of the law, towards not sinning; even as it is written,
‘He hath given them a law for a help;’”1766 but yet they disapproved of this knowledge of
the law being that grace of God concerning which the Scripture says: “Who shall deliver me
from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”1767 Nor did
Pelagius say absolutely: “All men are ruled by their own will,” as if God did not rule them;
for he said, when questioned on this point: “This I stated in the interest of the freedom of
our will; God is its helper, whenever it makes choice of good. Man, however, when sinning,
is himself in fault, as being under the direction of his free will.”1768 They approved, moreover,
of his statement, that “in the day of judgment no forbearance will be shown to the ungodly
and sinners, but they will be punished in everlasting fires;” because in his defence he said,
“that he had made such an assertion in accordance with the gospel, in which it is written
concerning sinners, ‘These shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
life eternal.’”1769 But he did not say, all sinners are reserved for eternal punishment, for then
he would evidently have run counter to the apostle, who distinctly states that some of them

will be saved, “yet so as by fire.”1770 When also Pelagius said that “the kingdom of heaven
was promised even in the Old Testament,” they approved of the statement, on the ground
that he supported himself by the testimony of the prophet Daniel, who thus wrote: “The
saints shall take the kingdom of the Most High.”1771 They understood him, in this statement
of his, to mean by the term “Old Testament,” not simply the Testament which was made
on Mount Sinai, but the entire body of the canonical Scriptures which had been given previous
to the coming of the Lord. His allegation, however, that “a man is able to be without
sin, if he wishes,” was not approved by the bishops in the sense which he had evidently
meant it to bear in his book1772—as if this was solely in a man’s power by free will (for it
was contended that he must have meant no less than this by his saying: “if he wishes”),—but
only in the sense which he actually gave to the passage on the present occasion in his answer;
in the very sense, indeed, in which the episcopal judges mentioned the subject in their own
interlocution with especial brevity and clearness, that a man is able to be without sin with
the help and grace of God. But still it was left undetermined when the saints were to attain
to this state of perfection,—whether in the body of this death, or when death shall be swallowed
up in victory.</p>

of Pelagius, as His Master, and Condemned.</head>
<p>Of the opinions which Coelestius has said or written, and which were objected against
Pelagius, on the ground that they were the dogmas of his disciple, he acknowledged some
as entertained also by himself; but, in his vindication, he said that he held them in a different
sense from that which was alleged in the indictment. One of these opinions was thus stated:
“Before the advent of Christ some men lived holy and righteous lives.”1773 Coelestius,
however, was stated to have said that “they lived sinless lives.” Again, it was objected that
Coelestius declared “the Church to be without spot and wrinkle.”1774 Pelagius, however,
said in his reply, “that he had made such an assertion, but as meaning that the Church is by
the laver cleansed from every spot and wrinkle, and that in this purity the Lord would have
her continue.” Respecting that statement of Coelestius: “That we do more than is commanded
us in the law and the gospel,” Pelagius urged in his own vindication,1775 that “he spoke
concerning virginity,” of which Paul says: “I have no commandment of the Lord.”1776 Another
objection alleged that Coelestius had maintained that “every individual has the ability
to possess all powers and graces,” thus annulling that “diversity of gifts” which, the apostle
sets forth.1777 Pelagius, however, answered, that “he did not annul the diversity of gifts, but
declared that God gives to the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all
graces, even as He gave the Apostle Paul.”</p>

<head>Chapter 64.—How the Bishops Cleared Pelagius of Those Charges.</head>
<p>These four dogmas, thus connected with the name of Coelestius, were therefore not
approved by the bishops in their judgment, in the sense in which Coelestius was said to have
set them forth but in the sense which Pelagius gave to them in his reply. For they saw clearly
enough, that it is one thing to be without sin, and another thing to live holily and righteously,
as Scripture testifies that some lived even before the coming of Christ. And that although
the Church here on earth is not without spot or wrinkle, she is yet both cleansed from every
spot and wrinkle by the laver of regeneration, and in this state the Lord would have her
continue. And continue she certainly will, for without doubt she shall reign without spot
or wrinkle in an everlasting felicity. And that the perpetual virginity, which is not commanded,
is unquestionably more than the purity of wedded life, which is commanded—although
virginity is persevered in by many persons, who, notwithstanding, are not without
sin. And that all those graces which he enumerates in a certain passage were possessed by
the Apostle Paul; and yet, for all that, either they could quite understand, in regard to his
having been worthy to receive them, that the merit was not according to his works, but
rather, in some way, according to predestination (for the apostle says himself: “I am not
meet to be called an apostle;”)1778 or else their attention was not arrested by the sense which
Pelagius gave to the word, as he himself viewed it. Such are the points on which the bishops
pronounced the agreement of Pelagius with the doctrines of godly truth.</p>

<head>Chapter 65.—Recapitulation of What Pelagius Condemned.</head>
<p>Let us now, by a like recapitulation, bestow a little more attention on those subjects
which the bishops said he rejected and condemned as “contrary;” for herein especially lies
the whole of that heresy. We will entirely pass over the strange terms of adulation which he
is reported to have put into writing in praise of a certain widow; these he denied having ever
inserted in any of his writings, or ever given utterance to, and he anathematized all who
held the opinions in question not indeed as heretics, but as fools.1779 The following are the
wild thickets of this heresy, which we are sorry to see shooting out buds, nay growing into
trees, day by day:—“That1780 Adam was made mortal, and would have died whether he had
sinned or not; that Adam’s sin injured only himself, and not the human race; that the law
no less than the gospel leads to the kingdom; that new-born infants are in the same condition
that Adam was before the transgression; that the whole human race does not, on the one
hand, die in consequence of Adam’s death and transgression, nor, on the other hand, does
the whole human race rise again through the resurrection of Christ; that infants, even if
they die unbaptized, have eternal life; that rich men, even if baptized, unless they renounce
and surrender everything, have, whatever good they may seem to have done, nothing of it
reckoned to them, neither can they possess the kingdom of God; that1781 God’s grace and
assistance are not given for single actions, but reside in free will, and in the law and teaching;
that the grace of God is bestowed according to our merits, so that grace really lies in the will
of man, as he makes himself worthy or unworthy of it; that men cannot be called children
of God, unless they have become entirely free from sin; that forgetfulness and ignorance do
not come under sin, as they do not happen through the will, but of necessity; that there is
no free will, if it needs the help of God, inasmuch as every one has his proper will either to
do something, or to abstain from doing it; that our victory comes not from God’s help, but
from free will; that from what Peter says, that ‘we are partakers of the divine nature,’1782 it
must follow that the soul has the power of being without sin, just in the way that God
Himself has.” For this have I read in the eleventh chapter of the book, which bears no title
of its author, but is commonly reported to be the work of Coelestius,—expressed in these
words: “Now how can anybody,” asks the author, “become a partaker of the thing from the
condition and power of which he is distinctly declared to be a stranger?” Accordingly, the
brethren who prepared these objections understood him to have said that man’s soul and
God are of the same nature, and to have asserted that the soul is part of God; for thus they

<note type="footnote">1781 See above, 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">1782 2 Pet. i. 4.</note>

<pb n="639"/>
understood that he meant that the soul partakes of the same condition and power as God.
Moreover in the last of the objections laid to his charge there occurs this position: “That
pardon is not given to penitents according to the grace and mercy of God, but according to
their own merits and effort, since through repentance they have been worthy of mercy.”
Now all these dogmas, and the arguments which were advanced in support of them, were
repudiated and anathematized by Pelagius, and his conduct herein was approved of by the
judges, who accordingly pronounced that he had, by his rejection and anathema, condemned
the opinions in question as contrary to the faith. Let us therefore rejoice—whatever may be
the circumstances of the case, whether Coelestius laid down these theses or not, or whether
Pelagius believed them or not—that the injurious principles of this new heresy were condemned
before that ecclesiastical tribunal; and let us thank God for such a result, and proclaim
His praises.</p>

<head>Chapter 66.—The Harsh Measures of the Pelagians Against the Holy Monks and
Nuns Who Belonged to Jerome’s Charge.</head>
<p>Certain followers of Pelagius are said to have carried their support of his cause after
these judicial proceedings to an incredible extent of perverseness and audacity. They are
said1783 to have most cruelly beaten and maltreated the servants and handmaidens of the
Lord who lived under the care of the holy presbyter Jerome, slain his deacon, and burnt his
monastic houses; whilst he himself, by God’s mercy, narrowly escaped the violent attacks
of these impious assailants in the shelter of a well-defended fortress. However, I think it
better becomes me to say nothing of these matters, but to wait and see what measures our
brethren the bishops may deem it their duty to adopt concerning such scandalous enormities;
for nobody can suppose that it is possible for them to pass them over without notice. Impious
doctrines put forth by persons of this character it is no doubt the duty of all catholics, however
remote their residence, to oppose and refute, and so to hinder all injury from such opinions
wheresoever they may happen to find their way; but impious actions it belongs to the discipline
of the episcopal authority on the spot to control, and they must be left for punishment
to the bishops of the very place or immediate neighbourhood, to be dealt with as pastoral
diligence and godly severity may suggest. We, therefore, who live at so great a distance, are
bound to hope that such a stop may there be put to proceedings of this kind, that there may
be no necessity elsewhere of further invoking judicial remedies. But what rather befits our
personal activity is so to set forth the truth, that the minds of all those who have been severely
wounded by the report, so widely spread everywhere, may be healed by the mercy of God
following our efforts. With this desire, I must now at last terminate this work, which, should
it succeed, as I hope, in commending itself to your mind, will, I trust, with the Lord’s blessing,
become serviceable to its readers—recommended to them rather by your name than by my
own, and through your care and diligence receiving a wider circulation.</p>

“Plunder, slaughter, incendiary fire, every atrocity of the maddest kind have been deplored by the noble and
holy virgins Eustochium and Paula, as having been perpetrated, at the devil’s instigation, in several places of

<head>EXTRACT FROM AUGUSTIN’S “RETRACTATIONS,”
Book II. Chap. 50,
ON THE FOLLOWING TREATISE,
“DE GRATIA CHRISTI, ET DE PECCATO ORIGINALI.”</head>
<p>“After the conviction and condemnation1784 of the Pelagian heresy with its authors by
the bishops of the Church of Rome,—first Innocent, and then Zosimus,—with the co-operation
of letters of African councils, I wrote two books against them: one On the Grace of
Christ, and the other On Original Sin. The work began with the following words: ‘How
greatly we rejoice on account of your bodily, and, above all, because of your Spiritual welfare.’”</p>
<note type="footnote">1784 From this it follows that we must refer his books On the Grace of Christ and On Original Sin to the year
418; for it was in this year that the Pelagian heresy was condemned by the pope Zosimus. Somewhat earlier there
was held a general council of the bishops of Africa at Carthage, to take measures against the heresy,—the precise
date of which council is May 1st of this year 418. Augustin, on account of this council, was detained at Carthage,
and his stay in that city was longer than usual, as one may learn from the 94th canon of the council, or from the
Codex Canonum of the Church of Africa, canon 127, as well as from his epistle (193, sec. 1) to Mercator. And
it was in this interval of time, before he started for Mauritania Cæsariensis, that he wrote these two books for
Albina, Pinianus, and Melania; accordingly, in his Retractations, he places them just previous to the time of his
proceedings with Emeritus, which were concluded at Cæsarea on the 20th of September in this very year 418.
Julianus, in his work addressed to Turbantius, calumniously attacked a passage in the book On the Grace of
Christ; the passage is defended by Augustin in his work against Julianus, iv. 8. 47, where he mentions this first
book, addressed to the holy Pinianus, as he calls him, and gives its title as “Concerning Grace, in opposition to
Pelagius.” [Albina, with her son-in-law Pinianus, and her daughter Melania, by whose questions Augustin was
led to write this work, constituted an interesting family of ascetics, which had formerly lived in Africa, but at
this time were in Palestine; Pinianus at the head of a monastery, and his wife an inmate of a convent.—W.]</note>

<head>Book I.</head>
<p>ON THE GRACE OF CHRIST.</p>
<p>Wherein he shows that Pelagius is disingenuous in his confession of grace, inasmuch as he
places grace either in nature and free will, or in law and teaching; and, moreover, asserts
that it is merely the “possibility” (as he calls it) of will and action, and not the will and
action itself, which is assisted by divine grace; and that this assisting grace, too, is given
by God according to men’s merits; whilst he further thinks that they are so assisted for the
sole purpose of being able the more easily to fulfil the commandments. Augustin examines
those passages of his writings in which he boasted that he had bestowed express commendation
on the grace of God, and points out how they can be interpreted as referring to law
and teaching,—in other words, to the divine revelation and the example of Christ which
are alike included in “the teaching,”—or else to the remission of sins; nor do they afford
any evidence whatever that Pelagius really acknowledged Christian grace, in the sense of
help rendered for the performance of right action to natural faculty and instruction, by
the inspiration of a most glowing and luminous love; and he concludes with a request that
Pelagius would seriously listen to Ambrose, whom he is so very fond of quoting, in his
excellent eulogy in commendation of the grace of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—Suspicious Character of Pelagius’ Confession as to the Necessity of
Grace for Every Single Act of Ours.</head>
<p>You informed me in your letter, that you had entreated Pelagius to express in writing
his condemnation of all that had been alleged against him; and that he had said, in the
audience of you all: “I anathematize the man who either thinks or says that the grace of God,
whereby ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,’1786 is not necessary not only for
every hour and for every moment, but also for every act of our lives: and those who endeavour
to disannul it deserve everlasting punishment.” Now, whoever hears these words, and is ignorant
of the opinion which he has clearly enough expressed in his books,—not those, indeed,
which he declares to have been stolen from him in an incorrect form, nor those which he
repudiates, but those even which he mentions in his own letter which he forwarded to
Rome,—would certainly suppose that the views he holds are in strict accordance with the
truth. But whoever notices what he openly declares in them, cannot fail to regard these
statements with suspicion. Because, although he makes that grace of God whereby Christ
came into the world to save sinners to consist simply in the remission of sins, he can still
accommodate his words to this meaning, by alleging that the necessity of such grace for
every hour and for every moment and for every action of our life, comes to this, that while
we recollect and keep in mind the forgiveness of our past sins, we sin no more, aided not
by any supply of power from without, but by the powers of our own will as it recalls to our
mind, in every action we do, what advantage has been conferred upon us by the remission
of sins. Then, again, whereas they are accustomed to say that Christ has given us assistance
for avoiding sin, in that He has left us an example by living righteously and teaching what
is right Himself, they have it in their power here also to accommodate their words, by affirming
that this is the necessity of grace to us for every moment and for every action, namely,
that we should in all our conversation regard the example of the Lord’s conversation. Your
own fidelity, however, enables you clearly to perceive how such a profession of opinion as
this differs from that true confession of grace which is now the question before us. And yet
how easily can it be obscured and disguised by their ambiguous statements!</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>III.</del>—Grace According to the Pelagians.</head>
<p>But why should we wonder at this? For the same Pelagius, who in the Proceedings of
the episcopal synod unhesitatingly condemned those who say “that God’s grace and assistance
are not given for single acts, but consist in free will, or in law and teaching,”1787 upon which
points we were apt to think that he had expended all his subterfuges; and who also condemned
such as affirm that the grace of God is bestowed in proportion to our merits:—is
proved, notwithstanding, to hold, in the books which he has published on the freedom of
the will, and which he mentions in the letter he sent to Rome, no other sentiments than
those which he seemingly condemned. For that grace and help of God, by which we are assisted
in avoiding sin, he places either in nature and free will, or else in the gift of the law
and teaching; the result of which of course is this, that whenever God helps a man, He must
be supposed to help him to turn away from evil and do good, by revealing to him and
teaching him what he ought to do,1788 but not with the additional assistance of His co-operation
and inspiration of love, that he may accomplish that which he had discovered it to
be his duty to do.</p>
<note type="footnote">1787 See De Gestis Pelagii, c. 30.</note>

<head>Chapter 4.—Pelagius’ System of Faculties.</head>
<p>In his system, he posits and distinguishes three faculties, by which he says God’s commandments
are fulfilled,—capacity, volition, and action:1789 meaning by “capacity,” that by
which a man is able to be righteous; by “volition” that by which he wills to be righteous; by
“action,” that by which he actually is righteous. The first of these, the capacity, he allows to
have been bestowed on us by the Creator of our nature; it is not in our power, and we possess
it even against our will. The other two, however, the volition and the action, he asserts to
be our own; and he assigns them to us so strictly as to contend that they proceed simply
from ourselves. In short, according to his view, God’s grace has nothing to do with assisting
those two faculties which he will have to be altogether our own, the volition and the action,
but that only which is not in our own power and comes to us from God, namely the capacity;
as if the faculties which are our own, that is, the volition and the action, have such avail for
declining evil and doing good, that they require no divine help, whereas that faculty which
we have of God, that is to say, the capacity, is so weak, that it is always assisted by the aid of
grace.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="648"/>
<head>Chapter 5 <del>IV.</del>—Pelagius’ Own Account of the Faculties, Quoted.</head>
<p>Lest, however, it should chance to be said that we either do not correctly understand
what he advances, or malevolently pervert to another meaning what he never meant to bear
such a sense, I beg of you to consider his own actual words: “We distinguish,” says he, “three
things, arranging them in a certain graduated order. We put in the first place ‘ability;’ in the
second, ‘volition;’ and in the third, ‘actuality.’1790 The ‘ability’ we place in our nature, the
‘volition’ in our will, and the ‘actuality’ in the effect. The first, that is, the ‘ability,’ properly
belongs to God, who has bestowed it on His creature; the other two, that is, the ‘volition’
and the ‘actuality,’ must be referred to man, because they flow forth from the fountain of
the will. For his willing, therefore, and doing a good work, the praise belongs to man; or
rather both to man, and to God who has bestowed on him the ‘capacity’ for his will and
work, and who evermore by the help of His grace assists even this capacity. That a man is
able to will and effect any good work, comes from God alone. So that this one faculty can
exist, even when the other two have no being; but these latter cannot exist without that
former one. I am therefore free not to have either a good volition or action; but I am by no
means able not to have the capacity of good. This capacity is inherent in me, whether I will
or no; nor does nature at any time receive in this point freedom for itself. Now the meaning
of all this will be rendered clearer by an example or two. That we are able to see with our
eyes is not of us; but it is our own that we make a good or a bad use of our eyes. So again
(that I may, by applying a general case in illustration, embrace all), that we are able to do,
say, think, any good thing, comes from Him who has endowed us with this ‘ability,’ and
who also assists this ‘ability;’ but that we really do a good thing, or speak a good word, or
think a good thought, proceeds from our own selves, because we are also able to turn all
these into evil. Accordingly,—and this is a point which needs frequent repetition, because
of your calumniation of us,—whenever we say that a man can live without sin, we also give
praise to God by our acknowledgment of the capacity which we have received from Him,
who has bestowed such ‘ability’ upon us; and there is here no occasion for praising the human
agent, since it is God’s matter alone that is for the moment treated of; for the question is
not about ‘willing,’ or ‘effecting,’ but simply and solely about that which may possibly be.”</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="649"/>
<head>Chapter 6 <del>V.</del>—Pelagius and Paul of Different Opinions.</head>
<p>The whole of this dogma of Pelagius, observe, is carefully expressed in these words, and
none other, in the third book of his treatise in defence of the liberty of the will, in which he
has taken care to distinguish with so great subtlety these three things,—the “capacity,” the
“volition,” and the “action,” that is, the “ability,” the “volition,” and the “actuality,”—that,
whenever we read or hear of his acknowledging the assistance of divine grace in order to
our avoidance of evil and accomplishment of good,—whatever he may mean by the said
assistance of grace, whether law and the teaching or any other thing,—we are sure of what
he says; nor can we run into any mistake by understanding him otherwise than he means.
For we cannot help knowing that, according to his belief, it is not our “volition” nor our
“action” which is assisted by the divine help, but solely our “capacity” to will and act, which
alone of the three, as he affirms, we have of God. As if that faculty were infirm which God
Himself placed in our nature; while the other two, which, as he would have it, are our own,
are so strong and firm and self-sufficient as to require none of His help! so that He does not
help us to will, nor help us to act, but simply helps us to the possibility of willing and acting.
The apostle, however, holds the contrary, when he says, “Work out your own salvation with
fear and trembling.”1791 And that they might be sure that it was not simply in their being
able to work (for this they had already received in nature and in teaching), but in their actual
working, that they were divinely assisted, the apostle does not say to them, “For it is God
that worketh in you to be able,” as if they already possessed volition and operation among
their own resources, without requiring His assistance in respect of these two; but he says,
“For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to perform of His own good pleasure;”
1792 or, as the reading runs in other copies, especially the Greek, “both to will and to
operate.” Consider, now, whether the apostle did not thus long before foresee by the Holy
Ghost that there would arise adversaries of the grace of God; and did not therefore declare
that God works within us those two very things, even “willing” and “operating,” which this
man so determined to be our own, as if they were in no wise assisted by the help of divine
grace.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>VI.</del>—Pelagius Posits God’s Aid Only for Our “Capacity.”</head>
<p>Let not Pelagius, however, in this way deceive incautious and simple persons, or even
himself; for after saying, “Man is therefore to be praised for his willing and doing a good
work,” he added, as if by way of correcting himself, these words: “Or rather, this praise belongs
to man and to God.” It was not, however, that he wished to be understood as showing
any deference to the sound doctrine, that it is “God which worketh in us both to will and
to do,” that he thus expressed himself; but it is clear enough, on his own showing, why he
added the latter clause, for he immediately subjoins: “Who has bestowed on him the ‘capacity’
for this very will and work.” From his preceding words it is manifest that he places this capacity
in our nature. Lest he should seem, however, to have said nothing about grace, he
added these words: “And who evermore, by the help of His grace, assists this very capacity,”—“
this very capacity,” observe; not “very will,” or “very action;” for if he had said so
much as this, he would clearly not be at variance with the teaching of the apostle. But there
are his words: “this very capacity;” meaning that very one of the three faculties which he
had placed in our nature. This God “evermore assists by the help of His grace.” The result,
indeed, is, that “the praise does not belong to man and to God,” because man so wills that
yet God also inspires his volition with the ardour of love, or that man so works that God
nevertheless also cooperates with him,—and without His help, what is man? But he has associated
God in this praise in this wise, that were it not for the nature which God gave us
in our creation wherewith we might be able to exercise volition and action, we should neither
will nor act.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="651"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—Grace, According to the Pelagians, Consists in the Internal and Manifold
Illumination of the Mind.</head>
<p>As to this natural capacity which, he allows, is assisted by the grace of God, it is by no
means clear from the passage either what grace he means, or to what extent he supposes
our nature to be assisted by it. But, as is the case in other passages in which he expresses
himself with more clearness and decision, we may here also perceive that no other grace is
intended by him as helping natural capacity than the law and the teaching. [VII.] For in one
passage he says: “We are supposed by very ignorant persons to do wrong in this matter to
divine grace, because we say that it by no means perfects sanctity in us without our will,—as
if God could have imposed any command on His grace, without also supplying the help of
His grace to those on whom he imposed His commands, so that men might more easily
accomplish through grace what they are required to do by their free will.” Then, as if he
meant to explain what grace he meant, he immediately went on to add these words: “And
this grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also
in the help of God.” Now who can help wishing that he would show us what grace it is that
he would have us understand? Indeed, we have the strongest reason for desiring him to tell
us what he means by saying that he does not allow grace merely to consist in the law. Whilst,
however, we are in the suspense of our expectation, observe, I pray you, what he has further
to tell us: “God helps us,” says he, “by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes
of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the
present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the
manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.” He then concludes his statement with a kind
of absolution: “Does the man,” he asks, “who says all this appear to you to be a denier of
grace? Does he not acknowledge both man’s free will and God’s grace?” But, after all, he has
not got beyond his commendation of the law and of teaching; assiduously inculcating this
as the grace that helps us, and so following up the idea with which he had started, when he
said, “We, however, allow it to consist in the help of God.” God’s help, indeed, he supposed
must be recommended to us by manifold lures; by setting forth teaching and revelation, the
opening of the eyes of the heart, the demonstration of the future, the discovery of the devil’s
wiles, and the illumination of our minds by the varied and indescribable gift of heavenly
grace,—all this, of course, with a view to our learning the commandments and promises of
God. And what else is this than placing God’s grace in “the law and the teaching”?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="652"/>
<head>Chapter 9 <del>VIII.</del>—The Law One Thing, Grace Another. The Utility of the Law.</head>
<p>Hence, then, it is clear that he acknowledges that grace whereby God points out and
reveals to us what we are bound to do; but not that whereby He endows and assists us to
act, since the knowledge of the law, unless it be accompanied by the assistance of grace,
rather avails for producing the transgression of the commandment. “Where there is no law,”
says the apostle, “there is no transgression;”1793 and again: “I had not known lust except
the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”1794 Therefore so far are the law and grace from
being the same thing, that the law is not only unprofitable, but it is absolutely prejudicial,
unless grace assists it; and the utility of the law may be shown by this, that it obliges all whom
it proves guilty of transgression to betake themselves to grace for deliverance and help to
overcome their evil lusts. For it rather commands than assists; it discovers disease, but does
not heal it; nay, the malady that is not healed is rather aggravated by it, so that the cure of
grace is more earnestly and anxiously sought for, inasmuch as “The letter killeth, but the
spirit giveth life.”1795 “For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
righteousness should have been by the law.”1796 To what extent, however, the law gives assistance,
the apostle informs us when he says immediately afterwards: “The Scripture hath
concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them

1798 Now this very thing is serviceable to proud men, to be more firmly and manifestly
“concluded under sin,” so that none may pre-sumptuously endeavour to accomplish their
justification by means of free will as if by their own resources; but rather “that every mouth
may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Because by the deeds of
the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law
and the prophets.”1799 How then manifested without the law, if witnessed by the law? For
this very reason the phrase is not, “manifested without the law,” but “the righteousness
without the law,” because it is “the righteousness of God;” that is, the righteousness which
we have not from the law, but from God,—not the righteousness, indeed, which by reason
of His commanding it, causes us fear through our knowledge of it; but rather the righteous-

<head>Chapter 10 <del>IX.</del>—What Purpose the Law Subserves.</head>
<p>What object, then, can this man gain by accounting the law and the teaching to be the
grace whereby we are helped to work righteousness? For, in order that it may help much,
it must help us to feel our need of grace. No man, indeed, is able to fulfil the law through
the law. “Love is the fulfilling of the law.”1801 And the love of God is not shed abroad in our
hearts by the law, but by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.1802 Grace, therefore, is
pointed at by the law, in order that the law may be fulfilled by grace. Now what does it avail
for Pelagius, that he declares the self-same thing under different phrases, that he may not
be understood to place in law and teaching that grace which, as he avers, assists the “capacity”
of our nature? So far, indeed, as I can conjecture, the reason why he fears being so understood
is, because he condemned all those who maintain that God’s grace and help are not given
for a man’s single actions, but exist rather in his freedom, or in the law and teaching. And
yet he supposes that he escapes detection by the shifts he so constantly employs for disguising
what he means by his formula of “law and teaching” under so many various phrases.</p>

<head>Chapter 11 <del>X.</del>—Pelagius’ Definition of How God Helps Us: “He Promises Us Future
Glory.”</head>
<p>For in another passage, after asserting at length that it is not by the help of God, but out
of our own selves, that a good will is formed within us, he confronted himself with a question
out of the apostle’s epistle; and he asked this question: “How will this stand consistently
with the apostle’s words,1803 ‘It is God that worketh in you both to will and to perfect’?”
Then, in order to obviate this opposing authority, which he plainly saw to be most thoroughly
contrasted with his own dogma, he went on at once to add: “He works in us to will what is
good, to will what is holy, when He rouses us from our devotion to earthly desires, and from
our love of the present only, after the manner of brute animals, by the magnitude of the future
glory and the promise of its rewards; when by revealing wisdom to us He stirs up our sluggish
will to a longing after God; when (what you are not afraid to deny in another passage) he
persuades us to everything which is good.” Now what can be plainer, than that by the grace
whereby God works within us to will what is good, he means nothing else than the law and
the teaching? For in the law and the teaching of the holy Scriptures are promised future
glory and its great rewards. To the teaching also appertains the revelation of wisdom, whilst
it is its further function to direct our thoughts to everything that is good. And if between
teaching and persuading (or rather exhorting) there seems to be a difference, yet even this
is provided for in the general term “teaching,” which is contained in the several discourses
or letters; for the holy Scriptures both teach and exhort, and in the processes of teaching
and exhorting there is room likewise for man’s operation. We, however, on our side would
fain have him sometime confess that grace, by which not only future glory in all its magnitude
is promised, but also is believed in and hoped for; by which wisdom is not only revealed,
but also loved; by which everything that is good is not only recommended, but pressed upon
us until we accept it. For all men do not possess faith,1804 who hear the Lord in the Scriptures
promising the kingdom of heaven; nor are all men persuaded, who are counselled to come
to Him, who says, “Come unto me, all ye that labour.”1805 They, however, who have faith
are the same who are also persuaded to come to Him. This He Himself set forth most plainly,
when He said, “No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw
him.”1806 And some verses afterwards, when speaking of such as believe not, He says,
“Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him

<head>Chapter 12 <del>XI.</del>—The Same Continued: “He Reveals Wisdom.”</head>
<p>But what shall I say about the revelation of wisdom? For there is no man who can in
the present life very well hope to attain to the great revelations which were given to the
Apostle Paul; and of course it is impossible to suppose that anything was accustomed in
these revelations to be made known to him but what appertained to wisdom. Yet for all this
he says: “Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations,
there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me. For this
thing I besought the Lord thrice, that He would take it away from me. And He said unto
me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”1808 Now,
undoubtedly, if there were already in the apostle that perfection of love which admitted of
no further addition, and which could be puffed up no more, there could have been no further
need of the messenger of Satan to buffet him, and thereby to repress the excessive elation
which might arise from abundance of revelations. What means this elation, however, but a
being puffed up? And of love it has been indeed most truly said, “Love vaunteth not itself,
is not puffed up.” 1809 This love, therefore, was still in process of constant increase in the
great apostle, day by day, as long as his “inward man was renewed day by day,”1810 and
would then be perfected, no doubt, when he was got beyond the reach of all further vaunting
and elation. But at that time his mind was still in a condition to be inflated by an abundance
of revelations before it was perfected in the solid edifice of love; for he had not arrived at
the goal and apprehended the prize, to which he was reaching forward in his course.</p>

<head>Chapter 13 <del>XII.</del>—Grace Causes Us to Do.</head>
<p>To him, therefore, who is reluctant to endure the troublesome process, whereby this
vaunting disposition is restrained, before he attains to the ultimate and highest perfection
of charity, it is most properly said, “My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made
perfect in weakness,”1811—in weakness, that is, not of the flesh only, as this man supposes,
but both of the flesh and of the mind; because the mind, too, was, in comparison of that last
stage of complete perfection, weak, and to it also was assigned, in order to check its elation,
that messenger of Satan, the thorn in the flesh; although it was very strong, in contrast with
the carnal or animal faculties, which as yet understand not the things of the Spirit of God.1812
Inasmuch, then, as strength is made perfect in weakness, whoever does not own himself to
be weak, is not in the way to be perfected. This grace, however, by which strength is perfected
in weakness, conducts all who are predestinated and called according to the divine purpose1813
to the state of the highest perfection and glory. By such grace it is effected, not only
that we discover what ought to be done, but also that we do what we have discovered,—not
only that we believe what ought to be loved, but also that we love what we have believed.</p>

<head>Chapter 14 <del>XII.</del>—The Righteousness Which is of God, and the Righteousness
Which is of the Law.</head>
<p>If this grace is to be called “teaching,” let it at any rate be so called in such wise that God
may be believed to infuse it, along with an ineffable sweetness, more deeply and more internally,
not only by their agency who plant and water from without, but likewise by His
own too who ministers in secret His own increase,—in such a way, that He not only exhibits
truth, but likewise imparts love. For it is thus that God teaches those who have been called
according to His purpose, giving them simultaneously both to know what they ought to do,
and to do what they know. Accordingly, the apostle thus speaks to the Thessalonians: “As
touching love of the brethren, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught
of God to love one another.”1814 And then, by way of proving that they had been taught of
God, he subjoined: “And indeed ye do it towards all the brethren which are in all Macedonia.”
1815 As if the surest sign that you have been taught of God, is that you put into practice
what you have been taught. Of that character are all who are called according to God’s
purpose, as it is written in the prophets: “They shall be all taught of God.”1816 The man,
however, who has learned what ought to be done, but does it not, has not as yet been “taught
of God” according to grace, but only according to the law,—not according to the spirit, but
only according to the letter. Although there are many who appear to do what the law commands,
through fear of punishment, not through love of righteousness; and such righteousness
as this the apostle calls “his own which is after the law,”—a thing as it were commanded,
not given. When, indeed, it has been given, it is not called our own righteousness, but God’s;
because it becomes our own only so that we have it from God. These are the apostle’s words:
“That I may be found in Him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but
that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith.”1817 So
great, then, is the difference between the law and grace, that although the law is undoubtedly
of God, yet the righteousness which is “of the law” is not “of God,” but the righteousness
which is consummated by grace is “of God.” The one is designated “the righteousness of
the law,” because it is done through fear of the curse of the law; while the other is called “the
righteousness of God,” because it is bestowed through the beneficence of His grace, so that
it is not a terrible but a pleasant commandment, according to the prayer in the psalm: “Good
art Thou, O Lord, therefore in Thy goodness teach me Thy righteousness;”1818 that is, that
I may not be compelled like a slave to live under the law with fear of punishment; but rather

<head>Chapter 15 <del>XIV.</del>—He Who Has Been Taught by Grace Actually Comes to Christ.</head>
<p>Now as touching this kind of teaching, the Lord also says: “Every man that hath heard,
and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.”1819 Of the man, therefore, who has not
come, it cannot be correctly said: “Has heard and has learned that it is his duty to come to
Him, but he is not willing to do what he has learned.” It is indeed absolutely improper to
apply such a statement to that method of teaching, whereby God teaches by grace. For if,
as the Truth says, “Every man that hath learned cometh,” it follows, of course, that whoever
does not come has not learned. But who can fail to see that a man’s coming or not coming
is by the determination of his will? This determination, however, may stand alone, if the
man does not come; but if he does come, it cannot be without assistance; and such assistance,
that he not only knows what it is he ought to do, but also actually does what he thus knows.
And thus, when God teaches, it is not by the letter of the law, but by the grace of the Spirit.
Moreover, He so teaches, that whatever a man learns, he not only sees with his perception,
but also desires with his choice, and accomplishes in action. By this mode, therefore, of divine
instruction, volition itself, and performance itself, are assisted, and not merely the natural
“capacity” of willing and performing. For if nothing but this “capacity” of ours were assisted
by this grace, the Lord would rather have said, “Every man that hath heard and hath learned
of the Father may possibly come unto me.” This, however, is not what He said; but His words
are these: “Every man that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me.” Now
the possibility of coming Pelagius places in nature, or even—as we found him attempting to
say some time ago1820—in grace (whatever that may mean according to him),—when he
says, “whereby this very capacity is assisted;” whereas the actual coming lies in the will and
act. It does not, however, follow that he who may come actually comes, unless he has also
willed and acted for the coming. But every one who has learned of the Father not only has
the possibility of coming, but comes; and in this result are already included the motion of
the capacity, the affection of the will, and the effect of the action.1821</p>

<p>Now what is the use of his examples, if they do not really accomplish his own promise
of making his meaning clearer to us;1822 not, indeed, that we are bound to admit their sense,
but that we may discover more plainly and openly what is his drift and purpose in using
them? “That we are able,” says he, “to see with our eyes is not of us; but it is of us that we
make a good or a bad use of our sight.” Well, there is an answer for him in the psalm, in
which the psalmist says to God, “Turn Thou away mine eyes, that they behold not
iniquity.”1823 Now although this was said of the eyes of the mind, it still follows from it,
that in respect of our bodily eyes there is either a good use or a bad use that may be made
of them: not in the literal sense merely of a good sight when the eyes are sound, and a bad
sight when they are bleared, but in the moral sense of a right sight when it is directed towards
succouring the helpless, or a bad sight when its object is the indulgence of lust. For although
both the pauper who is succoured, and the woman who is lusted after, are seen by these
external eyes; it is after all from the inner eyes that either compassion in the one case or lust
in the other proceeds. How then is it that the prayer is offered to God, “Turn Thou away
mine eyes, that they behold not iniquity”? Or why is that asked for which lies within our
own power, if it be true that God does not assist the will?</p>

Good Action is from God?</head>
<p>“That we are able to speak,” says he, “is of God; but that we make a good or a bad use
of speech is of ourselves.” He, however, who has made the most excellent use of speech does
not teach us so. “For,” says He, “it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that
speaketh in you.”1824 “So, again,” adds Pelagius, “that I may, by applying a general case in
illustration, embrace all,—that we are able to do, say, think, any good thing, comes from
Him who has endowed us with this ability, and who also assists it.” Observe how even here
he repeats his former meaning —that of these three, capacity, volition, action, it is only the
capacity which receives help. Then, by way of completely stating what he intends to say, he
adds: “But that we really do a good thing, or speak a good word, or think a good thought,
proceeds from our own selves.” He forgot what he had before1825 said by way of correcting,
as it were, his own words; for after saying, “Man is to be praised therefore for his willing
and doing a good work,” he at once goes on to modify his statement thus: “Or rather, this
praise belongs both to man, and to God who has given him the capacity of this very will and
work.” Now what is the reason why he did not remember this admission when giving his
examples, so as to say this much at least after quoting them: “That we are able to do, say,
think any good thing, comes from Him who has given us this ability, and who also assists
it. That, however, we really do a good thing, or speak a good word, or think a good thought,
proceeds both from ourselves and from Him!” This, however, he has not said. But, if I am
not mistaken, I think I see why he was afraid to do so.</p>

afraid to admit that such an action proceeds “both from ourselves and from God,” lest it
should be objected to him in reply: “If the fact of our doing, speaking, thinking anything
good, is owing both to ourselves and to God, because He has endowed us with this ability,
then it follows that our doing, thinking, speaking evil things, is due to ourselves and to God,
because He has here also endowed us with ability of indifferency; the conclusion from this
being—and God forbid that we should admit any such—that just as God is associated with
ourselves in the praise of good actions, so must He share with us the blame of evil actions.”
For that “capacity” with which He has endowed us makes us capable alike of good actions
and of evil ones.</p>

Forth Its Own Fruit.</head>
<p>Concerning this “capacity,” Pelagius thus writes in the first book of his Defence of Free
Will: “Now,” says he, “we have implanted in us by God a capacity for either part.1826 It resembles,
as I may say, a fruitful and fecund root which yields and produces diversely according
to the will of man, and which is capable, at the planter’s own choice, of either shedding
a beautiful bloom of virtues, or of bristling with the thorny thickets of vices.” Scarcely
heeding what he says, he here makes one and the same root productive both of good and
evil fruits, in opposition to gospel truth and apostolic teaching. For the Lord declares that
“a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
fruit;”1827 and when the Apostle Paul says that covetousness is “the root of all evils,”1828 he
intimates to us, of course, that love may be regarded as the root of all good things. On the
supposition, therefore, that two trees, one good and the other corrupt, represent two human
beings, a good one and a bad, what else is the good man except one with a good will, that
is, a tree with a good root? And what is the bad man except one with a bad will, that is, a
tree with a bad root? The fruits which spring from such roots and trees are deeds, are words,
are thoughts, which proceed, when good, from a good will, and when evil, from an evil one.</p>

<p>Now a man makes a good tree when he receives the grace of God. For it is not by himself
that he makes himself good instead of evil; but it is of Him, and through Him, and in Him
who is always good. And in order that he may not only be a good tree, but also bear good
fruit, it is necessary for him to be assisted by the self-same grace, without which he can do
nothing good. For God Himself cooperates in the production of fruit in good trees, when
He both externally waters and tends them by the agency of His servants, and internally by
Himself also gives the increase.1829 A man, however, makes a corrupt tree when he makes
himself corrupt, when he falls away from Him who is the unchanging good; for such a declension
from Him is the origin of an evil will. Now this decline does not initiate some
other corrupt nature, but it corrupts that which has been already created good. When this
corruption, however, has been healed, no evil remains; for although nature no doubt had
received an injury, yet nature was not itself a blemish. 1830</p>

<p>The “capacity,” then, of which we speak is not (as he supposes) the one identical root
both of good things and evil. For the love which is the root of good things is quite different
from the cupidity which is the root of evil things—as different, indeed, as virtue is from
vice. But without doubt this “capacity” is capable of either root: because a man is not only
able to possess love, whereby the tree becomes a good one; but he is likewise able to have
cupidity, which makes the tree evil. This human cupidity, however, which is a vice, has for
its author man, or man’s deceiver, but not man’s Creator. It is indeed that “lust of the flesh,
and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the
world.”1831 And who can be ignorant of the usage of the Scripture, which under the designation
of “the world” is accustomed to describe those who inhabit the world?</p>

<p>That love, however, which is a virtue, comes to us from God, not from ourselves, according
to the testimony of Scripture, which says: “Love is of God; and every one that loveth is
born of God, and knoweth God: for God is love.”1832 It is on the principle of this love that
one can best understand the passage, “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin;”1833
as well as the sentence, “And he cannot sin.”1834 Because the love according to which we
are born of God “doth not behave itself unseemly,” and “thinketh no evil.”1835 Therefore,
whenever a man sins, it is not according to love: but it is according to cupidity that he
commits sin; and following such a disposition, he is not born of God. Because, as it has been
already stated, “the capacity” of which we speak is capable of either root. When, therefore,
the Scripture says, “Love is of God,” or still more pointedly, “God is love;” when the Apostle
John so very emphatically exclaims, “Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
upon us, that we should be called, and be, the sons of God!”1836 with what face can this
writer, on hearing that “God is love,” persist in maintaining his opinion, that we bare of
God one only of those three,1837 namely, “the capacity;” whereas it is of ourselves that we
have “the good will” and “the good action?” As if, indeed, this good will were a different
thing from that love which the Scripture so loudly proclaims to have come to us from God,
and to have been given to us by the Father, that we might become His children.</p>

as this writer has already suggested in reference to God’s grace, in that work which he addressed
to a holy virgin,1838 whom he mentions in the letter sent by him to Rome. For, after
adducing the testimony of the Apostle James, in which he says, “Submit yourselves unto
God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you,”1839 he goes on to say: “He shows us
how we ought to resist the devil, if we submit ourselves indeed to God and by doing His
will merit His divine grace, and by the help of the Holy Ghost more easily withstand the
evil spirit.” Judge, then, how sincere was his condemnation in the Palestine Synod of those
persons who say that God’s grace is conferred on us according to our merits! Have we any
doubt as to his still holding this opinion, and most openly proclaiming it? Well, how could
that confession of his before the bishops have been true and real? Had he already written
the book in which he most explicitly alleges that grace is bestowed on us according to our
deserts—the very position which he without any reservation condemned at that Synod in
the East? Let him frankly acknowledge that he once held the opinion, but that he holds it
no longer; so should we most frankly rejoice in his improvement. As it is, however, when,
besides other objections, this one was laid to his charge which we are now discussing, he
said in reply: “Whether these are the opinions of Coelestius or not, is the concern of those
who affirm that they are. For my own part, indeed, I never entertained such views; on the
contrary, I anathematize every one who does entertain them.”1840 But how could he “never
have entertained such views,” when he had already composed this work? Or how does he
still “anathematize everybody who entertains these views,” if he afterwards composed this
work?</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Pelagius Places Free Will at the Basis of All Turning to God for Grace.</head>
<p>But perhaps he may meet us with this rejoinder, that in the sentence before us he spoke
of our “meriting the divine grace by doing the will of God,” in the sense that grace is added
to those who believe and lead godly lives, whereby they may boldly withstand the tempter;
whereas their very first reception of grace was, that they might do the will of God. Lest, then,
he make such a rejoinder, consider some other words of his on this subject: “The man,” says
he, “who hastens to the Lord, and desires to be directed by Him, that is, who makes his own
will depend upon God’s, who moreover cleaves so closely to the Lord as to become (as the
apostle says) ‘one spirit’ with Him,1841 does all this by nothing else than by his freedom of
will.” Observe how great a result he has here stated to be accomplished only by our freedom
of will; and how, in fact, he supposes us to cleave to God without the help of God: for such
is the force of his words, “by nothing else than by his own freedom of will.” So that, after
we have cleaved to the Lord without His help, we even then, because of such adhesion of
our own, deserve to be assisted. [XXIII.] For he goes on to say: “Whosoever makes a right
use of this” (that is, rightly uses his freedom of will), “does so entirely surrender himself to
God, and does so completely mortify his own will, that he is able to say with the apostle,
‘Nevertheless it is already not I that live, but Christ liveth in me;’1842 and ‘He placeth his
heart in the hand of God, so that He turneth it whithersoever He willeth.’”1843 Great indeed
is the help of the grace of God, so that He turns our heart in whatever direction He pleases.
But according to this writer’s foolish opinion, however great the help may be, we deserve it
all at the moment when, without any assistance beyond the liberty of our will, we hasten to
the Lord, desire His guidance and direction, suspend our own will entirely on His, and by
close adherence to Him become one spirit with Him. Now all these vast courses of goodness
we (according to him) accomplish, forsooth, simply by the freedom of our own free will;
and by reason of such antecedent merits we so secure His grace, that He turns our heart
which way soever He pleases. Well, now, how is that grace which is not gratuitously conferred?
How can it be grace, if it is given in payment of a debt? How can that be true which
the apostle says, “It is not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man
should boast;” 1844 and again, “If it is of grace, then is it no more of works, otherwise grace
is no more grace:”1845 how, I repeat, can this be true, if such meritorious works precede as
to procure for us the bestowal of grace? Surely, under the circumstances, there can be no
gratuitous gift, but only the recompense of a due reward. Is it the case, then, that in order

to find their way to the help of God, men run to God without God’s help? And in order that
we may receive God’s help while cleaving to Him, do we without His help cleave to God?
What greater gift, or even what similar gift, could grace itself bestow upon any man, if he
has already without grace been able to make himself one spirit with the Lord by no other
power than that of his own free will?</p>

<p>Now I want him to tell us whether that king of Assyria,1846 whose holy wife Esther
“abhorred his bed,”1847 whilst sitting upon the throne of his kingdom, and clothed in all
his glorious apparel, adorned all over with gold and precious stones, and dreadful in his
majesty when he raised his face, which was inflamed with anger, in the midst of his splendour,
and beheld her, with the glare of a wild bull in the fierceness of his indignation; and the
queen was afraid, and her colour changed as she fainted, and she bowed herself upon the
head of the maid that went before her; 1848—I want him to tell us whether this king had yet
“hastened to the Lord, and had desired to be directed by Him, and had subordinated his
own will to His, and had, by cleaving fast to God, become one spirit with Him, simply by
the force of his own free will.” Had he surrendered himself wholly to God, and entirely
mortified his own will, and placed his heart in the hand of God? I suppose that anybody
who should think this of the king, in the state he was then in, would be not foolish only, but
even mad. And yet God converted him, and turned his indignation into gentleness. Who,
however, can fail to see how much greater a task it is to change and turn wrath completely
into gentleness, than to bend the heart to something, when it is not preoccupied with either
affection, but is indifferently poised between the two? Let them therefore read and understand,
observe and acknowledge, that it is not by law and teaching uttering their lessons

works in men’s hearts not only revelations of the truth, but also good dispositions of the

<head>Chapter 26 <del>XXV.</del>—The Pelagian Grace of “Capacity” Exploded. The Scripture
Teaches the Need of God’s Help in Doing, Speaking, and Thinking, Alike.</head>
<p>Let Pelagius, therefore, cease at last to deceive both himself and others by his disputations
against the grace of God. It is not on account of only one of these three1849—that is to say,
of the “capacity” of a good will and work—that the grace of God towards us ought to be
proclaimed; but also on account of the good “will” and “work” themselves. This “capacity,”
indeed, according to his definition, avails for both directions; and yet our sins must not also
be attributed to God in consequence, as our good actions, according to his view, are attributed
to Him owing to the same capacity. It is not only, therefore, on this account that the help
of God’s grace is maintained, because it assists our natural capacity. He must cease to say,
“That we are able to do, say, think any good, is from Him who has given us this ability, and
who also assists this ability; whereas that we really do a good thing, or speak a good word,
or think a good thought, proceeds from our own selves.” He must, I repeat, cease to say this.
For God has not only given us the ability and aids it, but He further works in us “to will and
to do.” 1850 It is not because we do not will, or do not do, that we will and do nothing good,
but because we are without His help. How can he say, “That we are able to do good is of
God, but that we actually do it is of ourselves,” when the apostle tells us that he “prays to
God” in behalf of those to whom he was writing, “that they should do no evil, but that they
should do that which is good?”1851 His words are not, “We pray that ye be able to do nothing
evil;” but, “that ye do no evil.” Neither does he say, “that ye be able to do good;” but, “that
ye do good.” Forasmuch as it is written, “As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are
the sons of God,”1852 it follows that, in order that they may do that which is good, they must
be led by Him who is good. How can Pelagius say, “That we are able to make a good use of
speech comes from God; but that we do actually make this good use of speech proceeds
from ourselves,” when the Lord declares, “It is the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in
you”?1853 He does not say, “It is not you who have given to yourselves the power of speaking
well;” but His words are, “It is not ye that speak.”1854 Nor does He say, “It is the Spirit of
your Father which giveth, or hath given, you the power to speak well;” but He says, “which
speaketh in you.” He does not allude to the motion1855 of “the capacity,” but He asserts the

effect of the co-operation. How can this arrogant asserter of free will say, “That we are able
to think a good thought comes from God, but that we actually think a good thought proceeds
from ourselves”? He has his answer from the humble preacher of grace, who says, “Not that
we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of
God.”1856 Observe he does not say, “to be able to think anything;” but, “to think anything.”</p>

<head>Chapter 27 <del>XXVI.</del>—What True Grace Is, and Wherefore Given. Merits Do Not
Precede Grace.</head>
<p>Now even Pelagius should frankly confess that this grace is plainly set forth in the inspired
Scriptures; nor should he with shameless effrontery hide the fact that he has too long
opposed it, but admit it with salutary regret; so that the holy Church may cease to be harassed
by his stubborn persistence, and rather rejoice in his sincere conversion. Let him distinguish
between knowledge and love, as they ought to be distinguished; because “knowledge puffeth
up, but love edifieth.”1857 And then knowledge no longer puffeth up when love builds up.
And inasmuch as each is the gift of God (although one is less, and the other greater), he
must not extol our righteousness above the praise which is due to Him who justifies us, in
such a way as to assign to the lesser of these two gifts the help of divine grace, and to claim
the greater one for the human will. And should he consent that we receive love from the
grace of God, he must not suppose that any merits of our own preceded our reception of
the gift. For what merits could we possibly have had at the time when we loved not God?
In order, indeed, that we might receive that love whereby we might love, we were loved
while as yet we had no love ourselves. This the Apostle John most expressly declares: “Not
that we loved God,” says he, “but that He loved us;”1858 and again, “We love Him, because
He first loved us.”1859 Most excellently and truly spoken! For we could not have wherewithal
to love Him, unless we received it from Him in His first loving us. And what good could we
possibly do if we possessed no love? Or how could we help doing good if we have love? For
although God’s commandment appears sometimes to be kept by those who do not love
Him, but only fear Him; yet where there is no love, no good work is imputed, nor is there
any good work, rightly so called; because “whatsoever is not of faith is sin,”1860 and “faith
worketh by love.”1861 Hence also that grace of God, whereby “His love is shed abroad in
our hearts through the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us,”1862 must be so confessed by
the man who would make a true confession, as to show his undoubting belief that nothing
whatever in the way of goodness pertaining to godliness and real holiness can be accomplished
without it. Not after the fashion of him who clearly enough shows us what he thinks
of it when he says, that “grace is bestowed in order that what God commands may be the
more easily fulfilled;” which of course means, that even without grace God’s commandments
may, although less easily, yet actually, be accomplished.</p>

already mentioned,1863 wherein he plainly indicates what he holds on this subject; for he
speaks of our “deserving the grace of God, and by the help of the Holy Ghost more easily
resisting the evil spirit.” Now why did he insert the phrase “more easily”? Was not the sense
already complete: “And by the help of the Holy Ghost resisting the evil spirit”? But who can
fail to perceive what an injury he has done by this insertion? He wants it, of course, to be
supposed, that so great are the powers of our nature, which he is in such a hurry to exalt,
that even without the assistance of the Holy Ghost the evil spirit can be resisted—less easily
it may be, but still in a certain measure.</p>

defended by His own daily help.” What need is there of such help, if free will is so strong
and so stedfast against sinning? But here, as before, he would have it understood that the
purpose of the alleged assistance is, that that may be more easily accomplished by grace

expunge the phrase “more easily,” and you leave not only a full, but also a sound sense, if it
be regarded as meaning simply this: “That men may accomplish through grace what they
are commanded to do by free will.” The addition of the words “more easily,” however, tacitly
suggests the possibility of accomplishing good works even without the grace of God. But
such a meaning is disallowed by Him who says, “Without me ye can do nothing.”1864</p>

in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us,”1865—I have nowhere, in those
writings of Pelagius and Coelestius which I have had the opportunity of reading, found them
acknowledging it as it ought to be acknowledged. In no passage at all have I observed them
recognising “the children of the promise,” concerning whom the apostle thus speaks: “They
which are children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the
promise are counted for the seed.”1866 For that which God promises we do not ourselves

<head>Chapter 32.—Why the Pelagians Deemed Prayers to Be Necessary. The Letter Which
Pelagius Despatched to Pope Innocent with an Exposition of His Belief.</head>
<p>Now I will say nothing at present about the works of Coelestius, or those tracts of his
which he produced in those ecclesiastical proceedings,1867 copies of the whole of which we
have taken care to send to you, along with another letter which we deemed it necessary to
add. If you carefully examine all these documents, you will observe that he does not posit
the grace of God, which helps us whether to avoid evil or to do good, beyond the natural
choice of the will, but only in the law and teaching. Thus he even asserts that their very
prayers are necessary for the purpose of showing men what to desire and love. All these
documents, however, I may omit further notice of at present; for Pelagius himself has lately
forwarded to Rome both a letter and an exposition of his belief, addressing it to Pope Innocent,
of blessed memory, of whose death he was ignorant. Now in this letter he says that
“there are certain subjects about which some men are trying to vilify him. One of these is,
that he refuses to infants the sacrament of baptism, and promises the kingdom of heaven
to some, independently of Christ’s redemption. Another of them is, that he so speaks of
man’s ability to avoid sin as to exclude God’s help, and so strongly confides in free will that
he repudiates the help of divine grace.” Now, as touching the perverted opinion he holds
about the baptism of infants (although he allows that it ought to be administered to them),
in opposition to the Christian faith and catholic truth, this is not the place for us to enter
on an accurate discussion, for we must now complete our treatise on the assistance of grace,
which is the subject we undertook. Let us see what answer he makes out of this very letter
to the objection which he has proposed concerning this matter. Omitting his invidious
complaints about his opponents, we approach the subject before us; and find him expressing
himself as follows.</p>
<note type="footnote">1867 Augustin again mentions a short treatise by Coelestius produced by him at Rome in some proceedings
of the church there, below, in ch. 36 (xxxiii.), and also in his work De Peccato Originali, chs. 2 and 5 (ii., v.), etc.
Those acts of the Roman church were drawn up (as Augustin testifies in his Contra duas Epistolas Pelagianorum,

<p>“See,” he says, “how this epistle will clear me before your Blessedness; for in it we clearly
and simply declare, that we possess a free will which is unimpaired for sinning and for not
sinning;1868 and this free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help.” Now you
perceive, by the understanding which the Lord has given you, that these words of his are
inadequate to solve the question. For it is still open to us to inquire what the help is by which
he would say that the free will is assisted; lest perchance he should, as is usual with him,
maintain that law and teaching are meant. If, indeed, you were to ask him why he used the
word “always,” he might answer: Because it is written, And in His law will he meditate day
and night.”1869 Then, after interposing a statement about the condition of man, and his
natural capacity for sinning and not sinning, he added the following words: “Now this power
of free will we declare to reside generally in all alike—in Christians, in Jews, and in Gentiles.
In all men free will exists equally by nature, but in Christians alone is it assisted by grace.”
We again ask: “By what grace?” And again he might answer: “By the law and the Christian
teaching.”</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—Pelagius Says that Grace is Given According to Men’s Merits. The
Beginning, However, of Merit is Faith; And This is a Gratuitous Gift, Not a Recompense
for Our Merits.</head>
<p>Then, again, whatever it is which he means by “grace,” he says is given even to Christians
according to their merits, although (as I have already mentioned above1870), when he was
in Palestine, in his very remarkable vindication of himself, he condemned those who hold
this opinion. Now these are his words: “In the one,” says he, “the good of their created1871
condition is naked and defenceless;” meaning in those who are not Christians. Then adding
the rest: “In these, however, who belong to Christ, there is defence afforded by Christ’s help.”
You see it is still uncertain what the help is, according to the remark we have already made
on the same subject. He goes on, however, to say of those who are not Christians: “Those
deserve judgment and condemnation, because, although they possess free will whereby they
could come to have faith and deserve God’s grace, they make a bad use of the freedom which
has been granted to them. But these deserve to be rewarded, who by the right use of free
will merit the Lord’s grace, and keep His commandments.” Now it is clear that he says grace
is bestowed according to merit, whatever and of what kind soever the grace is which he
means, but which he does not plainly declare. For when he speaks of those persons as deserving
reward who make a good use of their free will, and as therefore meriting the Lord’s
grace, he asserts in fact that a debt is paid to them. What, then, becomes of the apostle’s
saying, “Being justified freely by His grace”?1872 And what of his other statement too, “By
grace are ye saved”?1873—where, that he might prevent men’s supposing that it is by works,
he expressly added, “by faith.”1874 And yet further, lest it should be imagined that faith itself
is to be attributed to men independently of the grace of God, the apostle says: “And that not
of yourselves; for it is the gift of God.”1875 It follows, therefore, that we receive, without any
merit of our own, that from which everything which, according to them, we obtain because
of our merit, has its beginning—that is, faith itself. If, however, they insist on denying that
this is freely given to us, what is the meaning of the apostle’s words: “According as God hath
dealt to every man the measure of faith”?1876 But if it is contended that faith is so bestowed
as to be a recompense for merit, not a free gift, what then becomes of another saying of the

in Christ, and that each suffers for His sake. These men however, attribute faith to free will
in such a way as to make it appear that grace is rendered to faith not as a gratuitous gift, but
as a debt—thus ceasing to be grace any longer, because that is not grace which is not gratuitous.</p>

words as it is to adults,” when our inquiry concerns the thing, not merely the words? It is a
more important matter, that (as you write) with his own mouth he replied to your own
question, that “infants receive baptism for the remission of sins.” For he did not say here,
too, “in words of remission of sins,” but he acknowledged that they are baptized for the remission
itself; and yet for all this, if you were to ask him what the sin is which he supposes

Rome in the ecclesiastical proceedings there,1878 distinctly acknowledged that “infants too
are baptized for the remission of sins,” also denied “that they have any original sin.” But let
us now observe what Pelagius thought, not about the baptism of infants, but rather about
the assistance of divine grace, in this exposition of his belief which he forwarded to Rome.
“We confess,” says he, “free will in such a sense that we declare ourselves to be always in
need of the help of God.” Well, now, we ask again, what the help is which he says we require;
and again we find ambiguity, since he may possibly answer that he meant the law and the
teaching of Christ, whereby that natural “capacity” is assisted. We, however, on our side
require them to acknowledge a grace like that which the apostle describes, when he says:
“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound
mind;”1879 although it does not follow by any means that the man who has the gift of
knowledge, whereby he has discovered what he ought to do, has also the grace of love so as
to do it.</p>

<p>“Let them read,” says he, “the epistle which we wrote about twelve years ago to that holy
man Bishop Paulinus: its subject throughout in some three hundred lines is the confession
of God’s grace and assistance alone, and our own inability to do any good thing at all without
God.” Well, I have read this epistle also, and found him dwelling throughout it on scarcely
any other topic than the faculty and capacity of nature, whilst he makes God’s grace consist
almost entirely in this. Christ’s grace, indeed, he treats with great brevity, simply mentioning
its name, so that his only aim seems to have been to avoid the scandal of ignoring it altogether.
It is, however, absolutely uncertain whether he means Christ’s grace to consist in the remission
of sins, or even in the teaching of Christ, including also the example of His life (a
meaning which he asserts in several passages of his treatises); or whether he believes it to
be a help towards good living, in addition to nature and teaching, through the inspiring influence
of a burning and shining love.</p>

<p>“Let them also read,” says he, “my epistle to the holy Bishop Constantius, wherein I

to add the help of God’s grace.” Well, I read this letter too; and it had almost persuaded me
that he did acknowledge therein the grace about which our discussion is concerned, although
he did certainly seem in many passages of this work to contradict himself. But when there
also came to my hands those other treatises which he afterwards wrote for more extensive
circulation, I discovered in what sense he must have intended to speak of grace,—concealing
what he believed under an ambiguous generality, but employing the term “grace” in order
to break the force of obloquy, and to avoid giving offence. For at the very commencement
of this work (where he says: “Let us apply ourselves with all earnestness to the task which
we have set before us, nor let us have any misgiving because of our own humble ability; for
we believe that we are assisted by the mother’s faith and her daughter’s merit”1882) he appeared
to me at first to acknowledge the grace which helps us to individual action; nor did
I notice at once the fact that he might possibly have made this grace consist simply in the
revelation of teaching.</p>

what character they have been made by God, see what Christians have it in their power to
do, whose nature has been through Christ restored to a better condition, and who are,
moreover, assisted by the help of divine grace.”1883 By this restoration of nature to a better
state he would have us understand the remission of sins. This he has shown with sufficient
clearness in another passage of this epistle, where he says: “Even those who have become in
a certain sense obdurate through their long practice of sinning, can be restored through repentance.”
1884 But he may even here too make the assistance of divine grace consist in the
revelation of teaching.</p>

<head>Chapter 42 <del>XXXVIII.</del>—Grace Placed by Pelagius in the Remission of Sins and the

<p>Likewise in another place in this epistle of his he says: “Now, if even before the law, as
we have already remarked, and long previous to the coming of our Lord and Saviour, some
men are related to have lived righteous and holy lives; how much more worthy of belief is
it that we are capable of doing this since the illumination of His coming, who have been
restored by the grace of Christ, and born again into a better man? How much better than
they, who lived before the law, ought we to be, who have been reconciled and cleansed by
His blood, and by His example encouraged to the perfection of righteousness!”1885 Observe
how even here, although in different language, he has made the assistance of grace to consist
in the remission of sins and the example of Christ. He then completes the passage by adding
these words: “Better than they were even who lived under the law; according to the apostle,
who says, ‘Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under
grace.’1886 Now, inasmuch as we have,” says he, “said enough, as I suppose, on this point,
let us describe a perfect virgin, who shall testify the good at once of nature and of grace by
the holiness of her conduct, evermore warmed with the virtues of both.”1887 Now you ought
to notice that in these words also he wished to conclude what he was saying in such a way
that we might understand the good of nature to be that which we received when we were
created; but the good of grace to be that which we receive when we regard and follow the
example of Christ,—as if sin were not permitted to those who were or are under the law, on
this account, because they either had not Christ’s example, or else do not believe in Him.</p>

<p>That this, indeed, is his meaning, other words also of his show us,—not contained in
this work, but in the third book of his Defence of Free Will, wherein he holds a discussion
with an opponent, who had insisted on the apostle’s words when he says, “For what I would,
that do I not;”1888 and again, “I see another law in my members, warring against the law of
my mind.”1889 To this he replied in these words: “Now that which you wish us to understand
of the apostle himself, all Church writers1890 assert that he spoke in the person of the sinner,
and of one who was still under the law,—such a man as was, by reason of a very long custom
of vice, held bound, as it were, by a certain necessity of sinning, and who, although he desired
good with his will, in practice indeed was hurried headlong into evil. In the person, however,
of one man,” he continues, “the apostle designates the people who still sinned under the
ancient law. This nation he declares was to be delivered from this evil of custom through
Christ, who first of all remits all sins in baptism to those who believe in Him, and then urges
them by an imitation of Himself to perfect holiness, and by the example of His own virtues
overcomes the evil custom of their sins.” Observe in what way he supposes them to be assisted
who sin under the law: they are to be delivered by being justified through Christ’s grace, as
if the law alone were insufficient for them, without some reinforcement from Christ, owing
to their long habit of sinning; not the inspiration of love by His Holy Spirit, but the contemplation
and copy of His example in the inculcation of virtue by the gospel. Now here, at any
rate, there was the very greatest call on him to say plainly what grace he meant, seeing that
the apostle closed the very passage which formed the ground of discussion with these telling
words: “O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The
grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”1891 Now, when he places this grace, not in
the aid of His power, but in His example for imitation, what further hope must we entertain
of him, since everywhere the word “grace” is mentioned by him under an ambiguous generality?</p>

<p>Then, again, in the work addressed to the holy virgin,1892 of which we have spoken
already, there is this passage: “Let us submit ourselves to God, and by doing His will let us
merit the divine grace; and let us the more easily, by the help of the Holy Ghost, resist the
evil spirit.” Now, in these words of his, it is plain enough that he regards us as assisted by
the grace of the Holy Ghost, not because we are unable to resist the tempter without Him
by the sheer capacity of our nature, but in order that we may resist more easily. With respect,
however, to the quantity and quality, whatever these might be, of this assistance, we may
well believe that he made them consist of the additional knowledge which the Spirit reveals
to us through teaching, and which we either cannot, or scarcely can, possess by nature. Such
are the particulars which I have been able to discover in the book which he addressed to the
virgin of Christ, and wherein he seems to confess grace. Of what purport and kind these
are, you of course perceive.</p>

<head>Chapter 45 <del>XLI.</del>—To What Purpose Pelagius Thought Prayers Ought to Be Offered.</head>
<p>“Let them also read,” says he, “my recent little treatise which we were obliged to publish
a short while ago in defence of free will, and let them acknowledge how unfair is their determination
to disparage us for a denial of grace, when we throughout almost the whole
work acknowledge fully and sincerely both free will and grace.” There are four books in this
treatise, all of which I read, marking such passages as required consideration, and which I
proposed to discuss: these I examined as well as I was able, before we came to that epistle
of his which was sent to Rome. But even in these four books, that which he seems to regard
as the grace which helps us to turn aside from evil and to do good, he describes in such a
manner as to keep to his old ambiguity of language, and thus have it in his power so to explain
to his followers, that they may suppose the assistance which is rendered by grace, for the
purpose of helping our natural capacity, consists of nothing else than the law and the
teaching. Thus our very prayers (as, indeed, he most plainly affirms in his writings) are of
no other use, in his opinion, than to procure for us the explanation of the teaching by a divine
revelation, not to procure help for the mind of man to perfect by love and action what it
has learned should be done. The fact is, he does not in the least relinquish that very manifest
dogma of his system in which he sets forth those three things, capacity, volition, action;
maintaining that only the first of these, the capacity, is favoured with the constant assistance
of divine help, but supposing that the volition and the action stand in no need of God’s assistance.
Moreover, the very help which he says assists our natural capacity, he places in the
law and teaching. This teaching, he allows, is revealed or explained to us by the Holy Ghost,
on which account it is that he concedes the necessity of prayer. But still this assistance of
law and teaching he supposes to have existed even in the days of the prophets; whereas the
help of grace, which is properly so called, he will have to lie simply in the example of Christ.
But this example, you can plainly see, pertains after all to “teaching,”—even that which is
preached to us as the gospel. The general result, then, is the pointing out, as it were, of a
road to us by which we are bound to walk, by the powers of our free will, and needing no
assistance from any one else, may suffice to ourselves not to faint or fail on the way. And
even as to the discovery of the road itself, he contends that nature alone is competent for it;
only the discovery will be more easily effected if grace renders assistance.</p>

<p>Such are the particulars which, to the best of my ability, I have succeeded in obtaining
from the writings of Pelagius, whenever he makes mention of grace. You perceive, however,
that men who entertain such opinions as we have reviewed are “ignorant of God’s righteousness,
and desire to establish their own,”1893 and are far off from “the righteousness which
we have of God”1894 and not of ourselves; and this they ought to have discovered and recognised
in the very holy canonical Scriptures. Forasmuch, however, as they read these Scriptures
in a sense of their own, they of course fail to observe even the most obvious truths therein.
Would that they would but turn their attention in no careless mood to what might be learned
concerning the help of God’s grace in the writings, at all events, of catholic authors; for they
freely allow that the Scriptures were correctly understood by these, and that they would not
pass them by in neglect, out of an overweening fondness for their own opinions. For note
how this very man Pelagius, in that very treatise of his so recently put forth, and which he
formally mentions in his self-defence (that is to say, in the third book of his Defence of Free
Will), praises St. Ambrose.</p>

<p>“The blessed Bishop Ambrose,” says he, “in whose writings the Roman faith shines forth
with especial brightness, and whom the Latins have always regarded as the very flower and
glory of their authors, and who has never found a foe bold enough to censure his faith or
the purity of his understanding of the Scriptures.” Observe the sort as well as the amount
of the praises which he bestows; nevertheless, however holy and learned he is, he is not to
be compared to the authority of the canonical Scripture. The reason of this high commendation
of Ambrose lies in the circumstance, that Pelagius sees proper to quote a certain passage
from his writings to prove that man is able to live without sin.1895 This, however, is not the
question before us. We are at present discussing that assistance of grace which helps us towards
avoiding sin, and leading holy lives.</p>

<head>Chapter 48 <del>XLIV</del>.—Ambrose is Not in Agreement with Pelagius.</head>
<p>I wish, indeed, that he would listen to the venerable bishop when, in the second book
of his Exposition of the Gospel according to Luke,1896he expressly teaches us that the Lord
co-operates also with our wills. “You see, therefore,” says he, “because the power of the Lord
co-operates everywhere with human efforts, that no man is able to build without the Lord,
no man to watch without the Lord, no man to undertake anything without the Lord. Whence
the apostle thus enjoins: ‘Whether ye eat, or whether ye drink, do all to the glory of God.’”1897
You observe how the holy Ambrose takes away from men even their familiar expressions,—
such as, “We undertake, but God accomplishes,”—when he says here that “no man
is able to undertake anything without the Lord.” To the same effect he says, in the sixth
book of the same work,1898 treating of the two debtors of a certain creditor: “According to
men’s opinions, he perhaps is the greater offender who owed most. The case, however, is
altered by the Lord’s mercy, so that he loves the most who owes the most, if he yet obtains
grace.” See how the catholic doctor most plainly declares that the very love which prompts
every man to an ampler love appertains to the kindly gift of grace.</p>

Upon Peter.</head>
<p>That repentance, indeed, itself, which beyond all doubt is an action of the will, is wrought
into action by the mercy and help of the Lord, is asserted by the blessed Ambrose in the
following passage in the ninth book of the same work:1899 “Good, says he, “are the tears
which wash away sin. They upon whom the Lord at last turns and looks, bewail. Peter denied
Him first, and did not weep, because the Lord had not turned and looked upon him. He
denied Him a second time, and still wept not, because the Lord had not even yet turned and
looked upon him. The third time also he denied Him, Jesus turned and looked, and then
he wept most bitterly.” Let these persons read the Gospel; let them consider how that the
Lord Jesus was at that moment within, having a hearing before the chief of the priests; whilst
the Apostle Peter was outside,1900 and down in the hall,1901 sitting at one time with the
servants at the fire,1902 at another time standing,1903 as the most accurate and consistent
narrative of the evangelists shows. It cannot therefore be said that it was with His bodily
eyes that the Lord turned and looked upon him by a visible and apparent admonition. That,
then, which is described in the words, “The Lord turned and looked upon Peter,”1904 was
effected internally; it was wrought in the mind, wrought in the will. In mercy the Lord silently
and secretly approached, touched the heart, recalled the memory of the past, with His own
internal grace visited Peter, stirred and brought out into external tears the feelings of his
inner man. Behold in what manner God is present with His help to our wills and actions;
behold how “He worketh in us both to will and to do.”</p>

never be moved,’ confesses how injurious his confidence had proved to himself: ‘Thou didst
turn away Thy face,’ he says, ‘and I was troubled.’”1906 Pelagius ought to listen to the
teaching of so eminent a man, and should follow his faith, since he has commended his
teaching and faith. Let him listen humbly; let him follow with fidelity; let him indulge no
longer in obstinate presumption, lest he perish. Why does Pelagius choose to be sunk in

<p>Let him lend an ear also to the same godly bishop, who says, in the sixth book of this
same book:1908 “The reason why they would not receive Him is mentioned by the evangelist
himself in these words, ‘Because His face was as though He would go to Jerusalem.’1909 But
His disciples had a strong wish that He should be received into the Samaritan town. God,
however, calls whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes religious.” What wise
insight of the man of God, drawn from the very fountain of God’s grace! “God,” says he,
“calls whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes religious.” See whether this is
not the prophet’s own declaration: “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will
show pity on whom I will be pitiful;”1910 and the apostle’s deduction therefrom: “So then,”
says he, “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy.”1911 Now, when even his model man of our own times says, that “whomsoever God
deigns He calls, and whom He wills He makes religious,” will any one be bold enough to
contend that that man is not yet religious “who hastens to the Lord, and desires to be directed
by Him, and makes his own will depend upon God’s; who, moreover, cleaves so closely to
the Lord, that he becomes (as the apostle says) ‘one spirit’ with Him?”1912 Great, however,
as is this entire work of a “religious man,” Pelagius maintains that “it is effected only by the
freedom of the will.” But his own blessed Ambrose, whom he so highly commends in word,
is against him, saying, “The Lord God calls whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He
makes religious.” It is God, then, who makes religious whomsoever He pleases, in order that
he may “hasten to the Lord, and desire to be directed by Him, and make his own will depend
upon God’s, and cleave so closely to the Lord as to become (as the apostle says) ‘one spirit’
with Him;” and all this none but a religious man does. Who, then, ever does so much, unless
he be made by God to do it?</p>

<head>Chapter 52 <del>XLVII.</del>—If Pelagius Agrees with Ambrose, Augustin Has No Controversy
with Him.</head>
<p>Inasmuch, however, as the discussion about free will and God’s grace has such difficulty
in its distinctions, that when free will is maintained, God’s grace is apparently denied; whilst
when God’s grace is asserted, free will is supposed to be done away with,—Pelagius can so
involve himself in the shades of this obscurity as to profess agreement with all that we have
quoted from St. Ambrose, and declare that such is, and always has been, his opinion also;
and endeavour so to explain each, that men may suppose his opinion, to be in fair accord
with Ambrose’s. So far therefore, as concerns the questions of God’s help and grace, you
are requested to observe the three things which he has distinguished so very plainly, under
the terms “ability,” “will,” and “actuality,” that is, “capacity,” “volition,” and “action.”1913
If, then, he has come round to an agreement with us, then not the “capacity” alone in man,
even if he neither wills nor performs the good, but the volition and the action also,—in
other words, our willing well and doing well,—things which have no existence in man, except
when he has a good will and acts rightly:—if, I repeat, he thus consents to hold with us that
even the volition and the action are assisted by God, and so assisted that we can neither will
nor do any good thing without such help; if, too, he believes that this is that very grace of
God through our Lord Jesus Christ which makes us righteous through His righteousness,
and not our own, so that our true righteousness is that which we have of Him,—then, so
far as I can judge, there will remain no further controversy between us concerning the assistance
we have from the grace of God.</p>

<p>But in reference to the particular point in which he quoted the holy Ambrose with so
much approbation,—because he found in that author’s writings, from the praises he accorded
to Zacharias and Elisabeth, the opinion that a man might possibly in this life be without
sin;1914 although this cannot be denied if God wills it, with whom all things are possible,
yet he ought to consider more carefully in what sense this was said. Now, so far as I can see,
this statement was made in accordance with a certain standard of conduct, which is among
men held to be worthy of approval and praise, and which no human being could justly call
in question for the purpose of laying accusation or censure. Such a standard Zacharias and
his wife Elisabeth are said to have maintained in the sight of God, for no other reason than
that they, by walking therein, never deceived people by any dissimulation; but as they in
their sincerity appeared to men, so were they known in the sight of God.1915 The statement,
however, was not made with any reference to that perfect state of righteousness in which
we shall one day live truly and absolutely in a condition of spotless purity. The Apostle Paul,
indeed, has told us that he was “blameless, as touching the righteousness which is of the
law;”1916 and it was in respect of the same law that Zacharias also lived a blameless life. This
righteousness, however, the apostle counted as “dung” and “loss,” in comparison with the
righteousness which is the object of our hope,1917 and which we ought to “hunger and thirst
after,”1918 in order that hereafter we may be satisfied with the vision thereof, enjoying it
now by faith, so long as “the just do live by faith.”1919</p>

<head>Chapter 54 <del>XLIX.</del>—Ambrose Teaches that No One is Sinless in This World.</head>
<p>Lastly, let him give good heed to his venerable bishop, when he is expounding the
Prophet Isaiah,1920 and says that “no man in this world can be without sin.” Now nobody
can pretend to say that by the phrase “in this world” he simply meant, in the love of this
world. For he was speaking of the apostle, who said, “Our conversation is in heaven;”1921
and while unfolding the sense of these words, the eminent bishop expressed himself thus:
“Now the apostle says that many men, even while living in the present world, are perfect
with themselves, who could not possibly be deemed perfect, if one looks at true perfection.
For he says himself: ‘We now see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know
in part; but then shall I know, even as also I am known.’1922 Thus, there are those who are
spotless in this world, there are those who will be spotless in the kingdom of God; although,
of course, if you sift the thing minutely, no one could be spotless, because no one is without
sin.” That passage, then, of the holy Ambrose, which Pelagius applies in support of his own
opinion, was either written in a qualified sense, probable, indeed, but not expressed with
minute accuracy; or if the holy and lowly-minded author did think that Zacharias and
Elisabeth lived according to the highest and absolutely perfect righteousness, which was
incapable of increase or addition, he certainly corrected his opinion on a minuter examination
of it.</p>
<note type="footnote">1920 This work of Ambrose is no longer extant. It is again quoted by Augustin in his work, De Peccato Originali,
c. 47 [xli.]; in his De Nuptiis et Concupisc. i. 40 [xxxv.]; in his Contra Julianum, i. 11 [iv.], ii. 24 [viii.]; and

Nature.</head>
<p>He ought, moreover, carefully to note that, in the very same context from which he
quoted that passage of Ambrose’s, which seemed so satisfactory for his purpose, he also said
this: “To be spotless from the beginning is an impossibility to human nature.”1923 In this
sentence the venerable Ambrose does undoubtedly predicate feebleness and infirmity of
that natural “capacity,” which Pelagius refuses faithfully to regard as corrupted by sin, and
therefore boastfully extols. Beyond question, this runs counter to this man’s will and inclination,
although it does not contravene the truthful confession of the apostle, wherein he
says: “We too were once by nature the children of wrath, even as others.”1924 For through
the sin of the first man, which came from his free will, our nature became corrupted and
ruined; and nothing but God’s grace alone, through Him who is the Mediator between God
and men, and our Almighty Physician, succours it. Now, since we have already prolonged
this work too far in treating of the assistance of the divine grace towards our justification,
by which God co-operates in all things for good with those who love Him,1925 and whom
He first loved1926—giving to them that He might receive from them: we must commence
another treatise, as the Lord shall enable us, on the subject of sin also, which by one man
has entered into the world, along with death, and so has passed upon all men,1927 setting
forth as much as shall seem needful and sufficient, in opposition to those persons who have
broken out into violent and open error, contrary to the truth here stated.</p>

<p>Wherein Augustin shows that Pelagius really differs in no respect, on the question of original
sin and the baptism of infants, from his follower Coelestius, who, refusing to acknowledge
original sin and even daring to deny the doctrine in public, was condemned in trials before
the bishops—first at Carthage, and afterwards at Rome; for this question is not, as these
heretics would have it, one wherein persons might err without danger to the faith. Their
heresy, indeed, aimed at nothing else than the very foundations of Christian belief. He
afterwards refutes all such as maintained that the blessing of matrimony is disparaged
by the doctrine of original depravity, and an injury done to God himself, the Creator of
man who is born by means of matrimony.</p>

<p>Next I beg of you,1928 carefully to observe with what caution you ought to lend an ear,
on the question of the baptism of infants, to men of this character, who dare not openly
deny the laver of regeneration and the forgiveness of sins to this early age, for fear that
Christian ears would not bear to listen to them; and who yet persist in holding and urging
their opinion, that the carnal generation is not held guilty of man’s first sin, although they
seem to allow infants to be baptized for the remission of sins. You have, indeed, yourselves
informed me in your letter, that you heard Pelagius say in your presence, reading out of
that book of his which he declared that he had also sent to Rome, that they maintain that
“infants ought to be baptized with the same formula of sacramental words as adults.”1929
Who, after that statement, would suppose that one ought to raise any question at all on this
subject? Or if he did, to whom would he not seem to indulge a very calumnious disposition—
previous to the perusal of their plain assertions, in which they deny that infants inherit
original sin, and contend that all persons are born free from all corruption?</p>

<p>“The bishop Aurelius said: ‘Let what follows be recited.’ It was accordingly recited, ‘That
the sin of Adam was injurious to him alone, and not to the human race.’ Then, after the recital,
Coelestius said: ‘I said that I was in doubt about the transmission of sin,1932 but so as
to yield assent to any man whom God has gifted with the grace of knowledge; for I have
heard different opinions from those who have been even appointed presbyters in the Catholic
Church.’ The deacon Paulinus1933 said: ‘Tell us their names.’ Coelestius answered: ‘The
holy presbyter Rufinus,1934 who lived at Rome with the holy Pammachius. I have heard
him declare that there is no transmission of sin.’ The deacon Paulinus then asked: ‘Is there
any one else?’ Coelestius replied: ‘I have heard more say the same.’ The deacon Paulinus rejoined:
‘Tell us their names.’ Coelestius said: ‘Is not one priest enough for you?’” Then afterwards
in another place we read: “The bishop Aurelius said: ‘Let the rest of the accusation
be read.’ It then was recited ‘That infants at their birth are in the same state that Adam was
before the transgression;’ and they read to the very end of the brief accusation which had
been previously put in. [IV.] The bishop Aurelius inquired: ‘Have you, Coelestius, taught at
any time, as the deacon Paulinus has stated, that infants are at their birth in the same state
that Adam was before his transgression?’ Coelestius answered: ‘Let him explain what he
meant when he said, “before the transgression.’” The deacon Paulinus then said: ‘Do you on
your side deny that you ever taught this doctrine? It must be one of two things: he must
either say that he never so taught, or else he must now condemn the opinion.’ Coelestius
rejoined: ‘I have already said, Let him explain the words he mentioned, “before the transgres-

Bishop of Milan, and the author of his biography, which he wrote at the instance of Augustin. According to his

the year 412, or 413, or 422. The trial mentioned in the text took place about the commencement of the year
412, according to Augustin’s letter to Pope Innocent (See Augustin’s letter, 175, 1. 6). See above, in the treatise

<note type="footnote">1934 Mercator (Commonit. adv. Hæres. Pelagii) informs us that a certain Syrian called Rufinus introduced
the discussion against original sin and its transmission into Rome in the pontificate of Anastasius. According
to some, this was the Rufinus of Aquileia, whom Jerome (in Epist. ad Ctesiphont.) notices as the precursor of
Pelagius in his error about the sinless nature of man; according, however, to others, it is the other Rufinus,
mentioned by Jerome in his 66th Epistle, who is possibly the same as he who rejects the transmission of original
sin in a treatise On Faith, which J. Sismondi published as the work of Rufinus, a presbyter of the province of
Palestine. It is, at any rate, hardly possible to suppose that the Aquileian Rufinus either went to Rome, or lodged
there with Pammachius, in the time of Pope Anastasius.</note>

Aurelius said: ‘I ask, What conclusion I have on my part to draw from this man’s obstinacy;
my affirmation is, that although Adam, as created in Paradise, is said to have been made
immortal at first, he afterwards became corruptible through transgressing the commandment.
Do you say this, brother Paulinus?’ ‘I do, my lord,’ answered the deacon Paulinus. Then the
bishop Aurelius said: ‘As regards the condition of infants before baptism at the present day,
the deacon Paulinus wishes to be informed whether it is such as Adam’s was before the
transgression; and whether it derives the guilt of transgression from the same origin of sin
from which it is born?’ The deacon Paulinus asked: ‘Let him deny whether he taught this,
or not.’ Coelestius answered: ‘As touching the transmission of sin, I have already asserted,
that I have heard many persons of acknowledged position in the catholic Church deny it
altogether; and on the other hand, others affirm it: it may be fairly deemed a matter for inquiry,
but not a heresy. I have always maintained that infants require baptism, and ought
to be baptized. What else does he want?’”</p>

<p>You, of course, see that Coelestius here conceded baptism for infants only in such a
manner as to be unwilling to confess that the sin of the first man, which is washed away in
the laver of regeneration, passes over to them, although at the same time he did not venture
to deny this; and on account of this doubt he refused to condemn those who maintain “That
Adam’s sin injured only himself, and not the human race;” and “that infants at their birth
are in the same condition wherein Adam was before the transgression.”</p>

<head>Chapter 5 <del>V.</del>—Coelestius’ Book Which Was Produced in the Proceedings at Rome.</head>
<p>But in the book which he published at Rome, and produced in the proceedings before
the church there, he so speaks on this question as to show that he really believes what he
had professed to be in doubt about. For these are his words:1935 “That infants, however,
ought to be baptized for the remission of sins, according to the rule of the Church universal,
and according to the meaning of the Gospel, we confess. For the Lord has determined that
the kingdom of heaven should only be conferred on baptized persons;1936 and since the
resources of nature do not possess it, it must necessarily be conferred by the gift of grace.”
Now if he had not said anything elsewhere on this subject, who would not have supposed
that he acknowledged the remission of original sin even in infants at their baptism, by saying
that they ought to be baptized for the remission of sins? Hence the point of what you have
stated in your letter, that Pelagius’ answer to you was on this wise, “That infants are baptized
with the same words of sacramental formula as adults,” and that you were rejoiced to hear
the very thing which you were desirous of hearing, and yet that you preferred holding a
consultation with us concerning his words.</p>

<p>Carefully observe, then, what Coelestius has advanced so very openly, and you will discover
what amount of concealment Pelagius has practised upon you. Coelestius goes on to
say as follows: “That infants, however, must be baptized for the remission of sins, was not
admitted by us with the view of our seeming to affirm sin by transmission. This is very alien
from the catholic meaning, because sin is not born with a man,—it is subsequently committed
by the man for it is shown to be a fault, not of nature, but of the will. It is fitting, therefore,
to confess this, lest we should seem to make different kinds of baptism; it is, moreover, necessary
to lay down this preliminary safeguard, lest by the occasion of this mystery evil
should, to the disparagement of the Creator, be said to be conveyed to man by nature, before
that it has been committed by man.” Now Pelagius was either afraid or ashamed to avow
this to be his own opinion before you; although his disciple experienced neither a qualm
nor a blush in openly professing it to be his, without any obscure subterfuges, in presence
of the Apostolic See.</p>

man’s repentance, if it might be, rather to bind him tightly by eliciting from him answers
to questions proposed by himself, than by the stroke of a severe condemnation to drive him
over the precipice, down which he seemed to be even now ready to fall. I say advisedly,
“down which he seemed to be ready to fall,” rather than “over which he had actually fallen,”
because he had already in this same book of his forecast the subject with an intended reference
to questions of this sort in the following words: “If it should so happen that any error of ignorance

<head>Chapter 8 [VII.]—Coelestius Condemned by Zosimus.</head>
<p>The venerable Pope Zosimus, keeping in view this deprecatory preamble, dealt with the
man, puffed up as he was with the blasts of false doctrine, so as that he should condemn all
the objectionable points which had been alleged against him by the deacon Paulinus, and
that he should yield his assent to the rescript of the Apostolic See which had been issued by
his predecessor of sacred memory. The accused man, however, refused to condemn the
objections raised by the deacon, yet he did not dare to hold out against the letter of the
blessed Pope Innocent; indeed, he went so far as to “promise that he would condemn all the
points which the Apostolic See condemned.” Thus the man was treated with gentle remedies,
as a delirious patient who required rest; but, at the same time, he was not regarded as being
yet ready to be released from the restraints of excommunication. The interval of two months
being granted him, until communications could be received from Africa, a place for recovery
was conceded to him, under the mild restorative of the sentence which had been pronounced.
For in truth, if he would have laid aside his vain obstinacy, and be now willing to carry out
what he had undertaken, and would carefully read the very letter to which he had replied
by promising submission, he would yet come to a better mind. But after the rescripts were
duly issued from the council of the African bishops, there were very good reasons why the
sentence should be carried out against him, in strictest accordance with equity. What these
reasons were you may read for yourselves, for we have sent you all the particulars.</p>

Deceive the Church at Rome.</head>
<p>Wherefore Pelagius, too, if he will only reflect candidly on his own position and writings,
has no reason for saying that he ought not to have been banned with such a sentence. For
although he deceived the council in Palestine, seemingly clearing himself before it, he entirely
failed in imposing on the church at Rome (where, as you well know, he is by no means a
stranger), although he went so far as to make the attempt, if he might somehow succeed.
But, as I have just said, he entirely failed. For the most blessed Pope Zosimus recollected
what his predecessor, who had set him so worthy an example, had thought of these very
proceedings. Nor did he omit to observe what opinion was entertained about this man by
the trusty Romans, whose faith deserved to be spoken of in the Lord,1937 and whose consistent
zeal in defence of catholic truth against this heresy he saw prevailing amongst them with
warmth, and at the same time most perfect harmony. The man had lived among them for
a long while, and his opinions could not escape their notice; moreover, they had so completely
found out his disciple Coelestius, as to be able at once to adduce the most trustworthy and
irrefragable evidence on this subject. Now what was the solemn judgment which the holy
Pope Innocent formed respecting the proceedings in the Synod of Palestine, by which
Pelagius boasts of having been acquitted, you may indeed read in the letter which he addressed
to me. It is duly mentioned also in the answer which was forwarded by the African
Synod to the venerable Pope Zosimus and which, along with the other instructions, we have

<p>Five bishops, then, of whom I was one, wrote him a letter,1939 wherein we mentioned
the proceedings in Palestine, of which the report had already reached us. We informed him
that in the East, where this man lived, there had taken place certain ecclesiastical proceedings,
in which he was thought to have been acquitted on all the charges. To this communication
from us Innocent replied in a letter which contains the following among other words: “There
are,” says he, “sundry positions, as stated in these very Proceedings, which, when they were
objected against him, he partly suppressed by avoiding them, and partly confused in absolute
obscurity, by wresting the sense of many words; whilst there are other allegations which he
cleared off,—not, indeed, in the honest way which he might seem at the time to use, but
rather by methods of sophistry, meeting some of the objections with a flat denial, and tampering
with others by a fallacious interpretation. Would, however, that he would even now
adopt what is the far more desirable course of turning from his own error back to the true
ways of catholic faith; that he would also, duly considering God’s daily grace, and acknowledging
the help thereof, be willing and desirous to appear, amidst the approbation of all
men, to be truly corrected by the method of open conviction,—not, indeed, by judicial
process, but by a hearty conversion to the catholic faith. We are therefore unable either to
approve of or to blame their proceedings at that trial; for we cannot tell whether the proceedings
were true, or even, if true, whether they do not really show that the man escaped by
subterfuge, rather than that he cleared himself by entire truth.”1940 You see clearly from
these words, how that the most blessed Pope Innocent without doubt speaks of this man as
of one who was by no means unknown to him. You see what opinion he entertained about
his acquittal. You see, moreover, what his successor the holy Pope Zosimus was bound to
recollect,—as in truth he did,—so as to confirm without hesitation the judgment of his
predecessor in this case.</p>

his judges in Palestine, not to mention other points, on this very question of the baptism of
infants, lest we should seem to any one to have used calumny and suspicion, rather than to
have ascertained the certain fact, when we alleged that Pelagius concealed the opinion which
Coelestius expressed with greater frankness, while at the same time he actually entertained
the same views. Now, from what has been stated above, it has been clearly seen that Coelestius
refused to condemn the assertion that “Adam’s sin injured only himself, and not the
human race, and that infants at their birth are in the same state that Adam was before the
transgression,” because he saw that, if he condemned these propositions, he would affirm
that there was in infants a transmission of sin from Adam. When, however, it was objected
to Pelagius that he was of one mind with Coelestius on this point, he condemned the words
without hesitation. I am quite aware that you have read all this before. Since, however, we
are not writing this account for you alone, we proceed to transcribe the very words of the
synodal acts, lest the reader should be unwilling either to turn to the record for himself, or

Cause of Pelagius.</head>
<p>“The synod said:1941 Now, forasmuch as Pelagius has pronounced his anathema on this
uncertain utterance of folly, rightly replying that a man by God’s help and grace is able to
live ἀναμάρτητος, that is to say, without sin, let him give us his answer on other articles
also. Another particular in the teaching of Coelestius, disciple of Pelagius, selected from the
heads which were mentioned and heard at Carthage before the holy Aurelius bishop of
Carthage, and other bishops, was to this effect: ‘That Adam was made mortal, and that he
would have died, whether he sinned or did not sin; that Adam’s sin injured himself alone,
and not the human race; that the law no less than the gospel leads us to the kingdom; that
before the coming of Christ there were persons without sin; that newborn infants are in the
same condition that Adam was before the transgression; that, on the one hand, the entire
human race does not die on account of Adam’s death and transgression, nor, on the other
hand, does the whole human race rise again through the resurrection of Christ; that the
holy bishop Augustin wrote a book in answer to his followers in Sicily, on articles which
were subjoined, and in this book, which was addressed to Hilary, are contained the following
statements: That a man is able to be without sin if he wishes; that infants, even if they are
unbaptized, have eternal life; that rich men, even if they are baptized, unless they renounce
and give up all, have, whatever good they may seem to have done, nothing of it reckoned
unto them, neither can they possess the kingdom of heaven.’ Pelagius then said: As regards
man’s ability to be without sin, my opinion has been already spoken. With respect, however,
to the allegation that there were even before the Lord’s coming persons who lived without
sin, we also on our part say, that before the coming of Christ there certainly were persons
who passed their lives in holiness and righteousness, according to the accounts which have
been handed down to us in the Holy Scriptures. As for the other points, indeed, even on
their own showing, they are not of a character which obliges me to be answerable for them;
but yet, for the satisfaction of the sacred Synod, I anathematize those who either now hold
or have ever held these opinions.”</p>

against those who hold that “Adam’s sin injured only himself, and not the human
race; and that infants are at their birth in the same condition in which Adam was before the
transgression.” Now what else could the bishops who sat in judgment on him have possibly
understood him to mean by this, but that the sin of Adam is transmitted to infants? It was
to avoid making such an admission that Coelestius refused to condemn this statement, which
this man on the contrary anathematized. If, therefore, I shall show that he did not really
entertain any other opinion concerning infants than that they are born without any contagion
of a single sin, what difference will there remain on this question between him and Coelestius,
except this, that the one is more open, the other more reserved; the one more pertinacious,
the other more mendacious; or, at any rate, that the one is more candid, the other more astute?
For, the one before the church of Carthage refused to condemn what he afterwards in
the church at Rome publicly confessed to be a tenet of his own; at the same time professing
himself “ready to submit to correction if an error had stolen over him, considering that he
was but human;” whereas the other both condemned this dogma as being contrary to the
truth lest he should himself be condemned by his catholic judges, and yet kept it in reserve
for subsequent defence, so that either his condemnation was a lie, or his interpretation a
trick.</p>

<head>Chapter 14 [XIII.]—He Shows That, Even After the Synod of Palestine, Pelagius
Held the Same Opinions as Coelestius on the Subject of Original Sin.</head>
<p>I see, however, that it may be most justly demanded of me, that I do not defer my
promised demonstration, that he actually entertains the same views as Coelestius. In the
first book of his more recent work, written in defence of free will (which work he mentions
in the letter he despatched to Rome), he says: “Everything good, and everything evil, on account
of which we are either laudable or blameworthy, is not born with us but done by us:
for we are born not fully developed, but with a capacity for either conduct; and we are procreated
as without virtue, so also without vice; and previous to the action of our own proper
will, that alone is in man which God has formed.” Now you perceive that in these words of
Pelagius, the dogma of both these men is contained, that infants are born without the contagion
of any sin from Adam. It is therefore not astonishing that Coelestius refused to condemn
such as say that Adam’s sin injured only himself, and not the human race; and that
infants are at their birth in the same state in which Adam was before the transgression. But
it is very much to be wondered at, that Pelagius had the effrontery to anathematize these
opinions. For if, as he alleges, “evil is not born with us, and we are procreated without fault,
and the only thing in man previous to the action of his own will is what God has formed,”
then of course the sin of Adam did only injure himself, inasmuch as it did not pass on to
his offspring. For there is not any sin which is not an evil; or a sin that is not a fault; or else
sin was created by God. But he says: “Evil is not born with us, and we are procreated without
fault; and the only thing in men at their birth is what God has formed.” Now, since by this
language he supposes it to be most true, that, according to the well-known sentence of his:
“Adam’s sin was injurious to himself alone, and not to the human race,” why did Pelagius
condemn this, if it were not for the purpose of deceiving his catholic judges? By parity of
reasoning, it may also be argued: “If evil is not born with us, and if we are procreated without
fault, and if the only thing found in man at the time of his birth is what God has formed,”
it follows beyond a doubt that “infants at their birth are in the same condition that Adam
was before the transgression,” in whom no evil or fault was inherent, and in whom that
alone existed which God had formed. And yet Pelagius pronounced anathema on all those
persons “who hold now, or have at any time held, that newborn babes are placed by their
birth in the same state that Adam was in before the transgression,”—in other words, are
without any evil, without any fault, having that only which God had formed. Now, why
again did Pelagius condemn this tenet also, if it were not for the purpose of deceiving the
catholic Synod, and saving himself from the condemnation of an heretical innovator?</p>

<head>Chapter 15 <del>XIV.</del>—Pelagius by His Mendacity and Deception Stole His Acquittal
from the Synod in Palestine.</head>
<p>For my own part, however, I, as you are quite aware, and as I also stated in the book
which I addressed to our venerable and aged Aurelius on the proceedings in Palestine, really
felt glad that Pelagius in that answer of his had exhausted the whole of this question.1942
To me, indeed, he seemed most plainly to have acknowledged that there is original sin in
infants, by the anathema which he pronounced against those persons who supposed that
by the sin of Adam only himself, and not the human race, was injured, and who entertained
the opinion that infants are in the same state in which the first man was before the transgression.
When, however, I had read his four books (from the first of which I copied the words
which I have just now quoted), and discovered that he was still cherishing thoughts which
were opposed to the catholic faith touching infants, I felt all the greater surprise at a mendacity
which he so unblushingly maintained in a synod of the Church, and on so great a
question. For if he had already written these books, how did he profess to anathematize
those who had ever entertained the opinions alluded to? If he purposed, however, afterwards
to publish such a work, how could he anathematize those who at the time were holding the
opinions? Unless, to be sure, by some ridiculous subterfuge he meant to say that the objects
of his anathema were such persons as had in some previous time held, or were then holding,
these opinions; but that in respect of the future—that is, as regarded those persons who
were about to take up with such views—he felt that it would be impossible for him to prejudge
either himself or other people, and that therefore he was guilty of no lie when he was afterwards
detected in the maintenance of similar errors. This plea, however, he does not advance,
not only because it is a ridiculous one, but because it cannot possibly be true; because in
these very books of his he both argues against the transmission of sin from Adam to infants,
and glories in the proceedings of the Synod in Palestine, where he was supposed to have
sincerely anathematized such as hold the opinions in dispute, and where he, in fact, stole
his acquittal by practising deceit.</p>

<head>Chapter 16 <del>XV.</del>—Pelagius’ Fraudulent and Crafty Excuses.</head>
<p>For what is the significance to the matter with which we now have to do of his answers
to his followers, when he tells them that “the reason why he condemned the points which
were objected against him, is because he himself maintains that primal sin was injurious
not only to the first man, but to the whole human race, not by transmission, but by example;”
in other words, not because those who have been propagated from him have derived any
fault from him, but because all who afterwards have sinned, have imitated him who committed
the first sin? Or when he says that “the reason why infants are not in the same state in
which Adam was before the transgression, is because they are not yet able to receive the
commandment, whereas he was able; and because they do not yet make use of that choice
of a rational will which he certainly made use of, since otherwise no commandment would
have been given to him”? How does such an exposition as this of the points alleged against
him justify him in thinking that he rightly condemned the propositions, “Adam’s sin injured
only himself, and not the whole race of man;” and “infants at their birth are in the self-same
state in which Adam was before he sinned;” and that by the said condemnation he is not
guilty of deceit in holding such opinions as are found in his subsequent writings, how that
“infants are born without any evil or fault, and that there is nothing in them but what God
has formed,”—no wound, in short, inflicted by an enemy?</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—How Pelagius Deceived His Judges.</head>
<p>Now, is it by making such statements as these, meeting objections which are urged in
one sense with explanations which are meant in another, that he designs to prove to us that
he did not deceive those who sat in judgment on him? Then he utterly fails in his purpose.
In proportion to the craftiness of his explanations, was the stealthiness with which he deceived
them. For, just because they were catholic bishops, when they heard the man pouring out
anathemas upon those who maintained that “Adam’s sin was injurious to none but himself,
and not to the human race,” they understood him to assert nothing but what the catholic
Church has been accustomed to declare, on the ground of which it truly baptizes infants
for the remission of sins—not, indeed, sins which they have committed by imitation owing
to the example of the first sinner, but sins which they have contracted by their very birth,
owing to the corruption of their origin. When, again, they heard him anathematizing those
who assert that “infants at their birth are in the same state in which Adam was before the
transgression,” they supposed him to refer to none others than those persons who “think
that infants have derived no sin from Adam, and that they are accordingly in that state that
he was in before his sin.” For, of course, no other objection would be brought against him
than that on which the question turned. When, therefore, he so explains the objection as to
say that infants are not in the same state that Adam was in before he sinned, simply because
they have not yet arrived at the same firmness of mind or body, not because of any
propagated fault that has passed on to them, he must be answered thus: “When the objections
were laid against you for condemnation, the catholic bishops did not understand them in
this sense; therefore, when you condemned them, they believed that you were a catholic.
That, accordingly, which they supposed you to maintain, deserved to be released from
censure; but that which you really maintained was worthy of condemnation. It was not you,
then, that were acquitted, who held tenets which ought to be condemned; but that opinion
was freed from censure which you ought to have held and maintained. You could only be
supposed to be acquitted by having been believed to entertain opinions worthy to be praised;
for your judges could not suppose that you were concealing opinions which merited condemnation.
Rightly have you been adjudged an accomplice of Coelestius, in whose opinions
you prove yourself to be a sharer. And though you kept your books shut during your trial,
you published them to the world after it was over.”</p>

<head>Chapter 18 <del>XVII.</del>—The Condemnation of Pelagius.</head>
<p>This being the case, you of course feel that episcopal councils, and the Apostolic See,
and the whole Roman Church, and the Roman Empire itself,1943 which by God’s gracious
favour has become Christian, has been most righteously moved against the authors of this
wicked error, until they repent and escape from the snares of the devil. For who can tell
whether God may not give them repentance to discover, and acknowledge, and even proclaim
His truth,1944 and to condemn their own damnable error? But whatever may be the bent
of their own will, we cannot doubt that the merciful kindness of the Lord has sought the
good of many persons who followed them, for no other reason than because they saw them
associated in communion with the catholic Church.</p>

<pb n="725"/>
<head>Chapter 19.—Pelagius’ Attempt to Deceive the Apostolic See; He Inverts the Bearings
of the Controversy.</head>
<p>But I would have you carefully observe the way in which Pelagius endeavoured by deception
to overreach even the judgment of the bishop of the Apostolic See on this very
question of the baptism of infants. He sent a letter to Rome to Pope Innocent of blessed
memory; and when it found him not in the flesh, it was handed to the holy Pope Zosimus,
and by him directed to us. In this letter he complains of being “defamed by certain persons
for refusing the sacrament of baptism to infants, and promising the kingdom of heaven irrespective
of Christ’s redemption.” The objections, however, are not urged against them in
the manner he has stated. For they neither deny the sacrament of baptism to infants, nor
do they promise the kingdom of heaven to any irrespective of the redemption of Christ. As
regards, therefore, his complaint of being defamed by sundry persons, he has set it forth in
such terms as to be able to give a ready answer to the alleged charge against him, without
injury to his own dogma. [XVIII.] The real objection against them is, that they refuse to
confess that unbaptized infants are liable to the condemnation of the first man, and that
original sin has been transmitted to them and requires to be purged by regeneration; their
contention being that infants must be baptized solely for being admitted into the kingdom
of heaven, as if they could only have eternal death apart from the kingdom of heaven, who
cannot have eternal life without partaking of the Lord’s body and blood. This, I would have
you know, is the real objection to them respecting the baptism of infants; and not as he has
represented it, for the purpose of enabling himself to save his own dogmas while answering
what is actually a proposition of his own, under colour of meeting an objection.</p>

<pb n="726"/>
<head>Chapter 20.—Pelagius Provides a Refuge for His Falsehood in Ambiguous Subterfuges.</head>
<p>And then observe how he makes his answer, how he provides in the obscure mazes of
his double sense retreats for his false doctrine, quenching the truth in his dark mist of error;
so that even we, on our first perusal of his words, almost rejoiced at their propriety and
correctness. But the fuller discussions in his books, in which he is generally forced, in spite
of all his efforts at concealment, to explain his meaning, have made even his better statements
suspicious to us, lest on a closer inspection of them we should detect them to be ambiguous.
For, after saying that “he had never heard even an impious heretic say this” (namely, what
he set forth as the objection) “about infants,” he goes on to ask: “Who indeed is so unacquainted
with Gospel lessons, as not only to attempt to make such an affirmation, but even
to be able to lightly say it or even let it enter his thought? And then who is so impious as to
wish to exclude infants from the kingdom of heaven, by forbidding them to be baptized and
to be born again in Christ?”</p>

<pb n="727"/>
<head>Chapter 21 <del>XIX.</del>—Pelagius Avoids the Question as to Why Baptism is Necessary
for Infants.</head>
<p>Now it is to no purpose that he says all this. He does not clear himself thereby. Not even
they have ever denied the impossibility of infants entering the kingdom of heaven without
baptism. But this is not the question; what we are discussing concerns the obliteration1945
of original sin in infants. Let him clear himself on this point, since he refuses to acknowledge
that there is anything in infants which the laver of regeneration has to cleanse. On this account
we ought carefully to consider what he has afterwards to say. After adducing, then,
the passage of the Gospel which declares that “whosoever is not born again of water and
the Spirit cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven”1946 (on which matter, as we have said,
they raise no question), he goes on at once to ask: “Who indeed is so impious as to have the
heart to refuse the common redemption of the human race to an infant of any age whatever?”
But this is ambiguous language; for what redemption does he mean? Is it from evil to good?
or from good to better? Now even Coelestius, at Carthage,1947 allowed a redemption for
infants in his book; although, at the same time, he would not admit the transmission of sin
to them from Adam.</p>

<head>Chapter 22 <del>XX.</del>—Another Instance of Pelagius’ Ambiguity.</head>
<p>Then, again, observe what he subjoins to the last remark: “Can any one,” says he, “forbid
a second birth to an eternal and certain life, to him who has been born to this present uncertain
life?” In other words: “Who is so impious as to forbid his being born again to the life
which is sure and eternal, who has been born to this life of uncertainty?” When we first read
these words, we supposed that by the phrase “uncertain life” he meant to designate this
present temporal life; although it appeared to us that he ought rather to have called it
“mortal” than “uncertain,” because it is brought to a close by certain death. But for all this,
we thought that he had only shown a preference for calling this mortal life an uncertain one,
because of the general view which men take that there is undoubtedly not a moment in our
lives when we are free from this uncertainty. And so it happened that our anxiety about him
was allayed to some extent by the following consideration, which rose almost to a proof,
notwithstanding the fact of his unwillingness openly to confess that infants incur eternal
death who depart this life without the sacrament of baptism. We argued: “If, as he seems to
admit, eternal life can only accrue to them who have been baptized, it follows of course that
they who die unbaptized incur everlasting death. This destiny, however, cannot by any
means justly befall those who never in this life committed any sins of their own, unless on
account of original sin.”</p>

<p>Certain brethren, however, afterwards failed not to remind us that Pelagius possibly
expressed himself in this way, because on this question he is represented as having his answer
ready for all inquirers, to this effect: “As for infants who die unbaptized, I know indeed
whither they go not; yet whither they go, I know not;” that is, I know they do not go into
the kingdom of heaven. But as to whither they go, he was (and for the matter of that, still is
1948) in the habit of saying that he knew not, because he dared not say that those went to
eternal death, who he was persuaded had never committed sin in this life, and whom he
would not admit to have inherited original sin. Consequently those very words of his which
were forwarded to Rome to secure his absolute acquittal, are so steeped in ambiguity that
they afford a shelter for their doctrine, out of which may sally forth an heretical sense to
entrap the unwary straggler; for when no one is at hand who can give the answer, any solitary
man may find himself weak.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Pelagius’ Long Residence at Rome.</head>
<p>The truth indeed is, that in the book of his faith which he sent to Rome with this very
letter1949 to the before-mentioned Pope Innocent, to whom also he had written the letter,
he only the more evidently exposed himself by his efforts at concealment. He says:1950 “We
hold one baptism, which we say ought to be administered in the same sacramental words
in the case of infants as in the case of adults.” He did not, however, say, “in the same sacrament”
(although if he had so said, there would still have been ambiguity), but “in the same
sacramental words,”—as if remission of sins in infants were declared by the sound of the
words, and not wrought by the effect of the acts. For the time, indeed, he seemed to say what
was agreeable with the catholic faith; but he had it not in his power permanently to deceive
that see. Subsequent to the rescript of the African Council, into which province this pestilent
doctrine had stealthily made its way—without, however, spreading widely or sinking
deeply—other opinions also of this man were by the industry of some faithful brethren
discovered and brought to light at Rome, where he had dwelt for a very long while, and had
already engaged in sundry discourses and controversies. In order to procure the condemnation
of these opinions, Pope Zosimus, as you may read, annexed them to his letter, which
he wrote for publication throughout the catholic world. Among these statements, Pelagius,
pretending to expound the Apostle Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, argues in these words: “If
Adam’s sin injured those who have not sinned, then also Christ’s righteousness profits those
who do not believe.” He says other things, too, of the same purport; but they have all been
refuted and answered by me with the Lord’s help in the books which I wrote, On the Baptism
of Infants.1951 But he had not the courage to make those objectionable statements in his
own person in the fore-mentioned so-called exposition. This particular one, however, having
been enunciated in a place where he was so well known, his words and their meaning could
not be disguised. In those books, from the first of which I have already before quoted,1952
he treats this point without any suppression of his views. With all the energy of which he is
capable, he most plainly asserts that human nature in infants cannot in any wise be supposed
to be corrupted by propagation; and by claiming salvation for them as their due, he does
despite to the Saviour.</p>

directly—now that those two men, Pelagius and Coelestius, have been either offered repentance,
or on their refusal been wholly condemned. They are reported, or perhaps actually
proved, to be the authors of this perversion; at all events, if not the authors (as having learnt
it from others), they are yet its boasted abettors and teachers, through whose agency the
heresy has advanced and grown to a wider extent. This boast, too, is made even in their own
statements and writings, and in unmistakeable signs of reality, as well as in the fame which
arises and grows out of all these circumstances. What, therefore, remains to be done? Must
not every catholic, with all the energies wherewith the Lord endows him, confute this pestilential
doctrine, and oppose it with all vigilance; so that whenever we contend for the truth,
compelled to answer, but not fond of the contest, the untaught may be instructed, and that
thus the Church may be benefited by that which the enemy devised for her destruction; in
accordance with that word of the apostle’s, “There must be heresies, that they which are

<head>Chapter 26 [XXIII.]—The Pelagians Maintain that Raising Questions About Original
Sin Does Not Endanger the Faith.</head>
<p>Therefore, after the full discussion with which we have been able to rebut in writing
this error of theirs, which is so inimical to the grace of God bestowed on small and great
through our Lord Jesus Christ, it is now our duty to examine and explode that assertion of
theirs, which in their desire to avoid the odious imputation of heresy they astutely advance,
to the effect that “calling this subject into question produces no danger to the faith,”—in
order that they may appear, forsooth, if they are convicted of having deviated from it, to
have erred not criminally, but only, as it were, courteously.1954 This, accordingly, is the
language which Coelestius used in the ecclesiastical process at Carthage:1955 “As touching
the transmission of sin,” he said, “I have already said that I have heard many persons of acknowledged
position in the catholic Church deny it, and on the other hand many affirm it;
it may fairly, indeed, be deemed a matter for inquiry, but not a heresy. I have always main-
tained that infants require baptism, and ought to be baptized. What else does he want?” He
said this, as if he wanted to intimate that only then could he be deemed chargeable with
heresy, if he were to assert that they ought not to be baptized. As the case stood, however,
inasmuch as he acknowledged that they ought to be baptized, he thought that he had not
erred [criminally], and therefore ought not to be adjudged a heretic, even though he maintained
the reason of their baptism to be other than the truth holds, or the faith claims as its
own. On the same principle, in the book which he sent to Rome, he first explained his belief,
so far as it suited his pleasure, from the Trinity of the One Godhead down to the kind of
resurrection of the dead that is to be; on all which points, however, no one had ever questioned
him, or been questioned by him. And when his discourse reached the question which
was under consideration, he said: “If, indeed, any questions have arisen beyond the compass
of the faith, on which there might be perhaps dissension on the part of a great many persons,
in no case have I pretended to pronounce a decision on any dogma, as if I possessed a
definitive authority in the matter myself; but whatever I have derived from the fountain of
the prophets and the apostles, I have presented for approbation to the judgment of your
apostolic office; so that if any error has crept in among us, human as we are, through our
ignorance, it may be corrected by your sentence.”1956 You of course clearly see that in this
action of his he used all this deprecatory preamble in order that, if he had been discovered
to have erred at all, he might seem to have erred not on a matter of faith, but on questionable
points outside the faith; wherein, however necessary it may be to correct the error, it is not

<p>But he is greatly mistaken in this opinion. The questions which he supposes to be outside
the faith are of a very different character from those in which, without any detriment to the
faith whereby we are Christians, there exists either an ignorance of the real fact, and a consequent
suspension of any fixed opinion, or else a conjectural view of the case, which, owing
to the infirmity of human thought, issues in conceptions at variance with truth: as when a
question arises about the description and locality of that Paradise where God placed man
whom He formed out of the ground, without any disturbance, however, of the Christian
belief that there undoubtedly is such a Paradise; or as when it is asked where Elijah is at the
present moment, and where Enoch—whether in this Paradise or in some other place, although
we doubt not of their existing still in the same bodies in which they were born; or
as when one inquires whether it was in the body or out of the body that the apostle was
caught up to the third heaven,—an inquiry, however, which betokens great lack of modesty
on the part of those who would fain know what he who is the subject of the mystery itself
expressly declares his ignorance of,1957 without impairing his own belief of the fact; or as
when the question is started, how many are those heavens, to the “third” of which he tells
us that he was caught up; or whether the elements of this visible world are four or more;
what it is which causes those eclipses of the sun or the moon which astronomers are in the
habit of foretelling for certain appointed seasons; why, again, men of ancient times lived to
the age which Holy Scripture assigns to them; and whether the period of their puberty, when
they begat their first son, was postponed to an older age, proportioned to their longer life;
or where Methuselah could possibly have lived, since he was not in the Ark, inasmuch as
(according to the chronological notes of most copies of the Scripture, both Greek and Latin)
he is found to have survived the deluge; or whether we must follow the order of the fewer
copies—and they happen to be extremely few—which so arrange the years as to show that
he died before the deluge. Now who does not feel, amidst the various and innumerable
questions of this sort, which relate either to God’s most hidden operations or to most obscure
passages of the Scriptures, and which it is difficult to embrace and define in any certain way,
that ignorance may on many points be compatible with sound Christian faith, and that occasionally
erroneous opinion may be entertained without any room for the imputation of
heretical doctrine?</p>

<head>Chapter 28 <del>XXIV.</del>—The Heresy of Pelagius and Coelestius Aims at the Very
Foundations of Our Faith.</head>
<p>This is, however, in the matter of the two men by one of whom we are sold under sin,1958
by the other redeemed from sins—by the one have been precipitated into death, by the
other are liberated unto life; the former of whom has ruined us in himself, by doing his own
will instead of His who created him; the latter has saved us in Himself, by not doing His
own will, but the will of Him who sent Him:1959 and it is in what concerns these two men
that the Christian faith properly consists. For “there is one God, and one Mediator between
God and men, the man Christ Jesus;”1960 since “there is none other name under heaven
given to men, whereby we must be saved;”1961 and “in Him hath God defined unto all men
their faith, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.”1962 Now without this faith, that is
to say, without a belief in the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
without faith, I say, in His resurrection by which God has given assurance to all men and
which no man could of course truly believe were it not for His incarnation and death; without
faith, therefore, in the incarnation and death and resurrection of Christ, the Christian verity
unhesitatingly declares that the ancient saints could not possibly have been cleansed from
sin so as to have become holy, and justified by the grace of God. And this is true both of the
saints who are mentioned in Holy Scripture, and of those also who are not indeed mentioned
therein, but must yet be supposed to have existed,—either before the deluge, or in the interval
between that event and the giving of the law, or in the period of the law itself,—not merely
among the children of Israel, as the prophets, but even outside that nation, as for instance
Job. For it was by the self-same faith in the one Mediator that the hearts of these, too, were
cleansed, and there also was “shed abroad in them the love of God by the Holy Ghost,”1963
“who bloweth where He listeth,”1964 not following men’s merits, but even producing these
very merits Himself. For the grace of God will in no wise exist unless it be wholly free.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—The Righteous Men Who Lived in the Time of the Law Were for All
that Not Under the Law, But Under Grace. The Grace of the New Testament
Hidden Under the Old.</head>
<p>Death indeed reigned from Adam until Moses,1965 because it was not possible even for
the law given through Moses to overcome it: it was not given, in fact, as something able to
give life;1966 but as something that ought to show those that were dead and for whom grace
was needed to give them life, that they were not only prostrated under the propagation and
domination of sin, but also convicted by the additional guilt of breaking the law itself: not
in order that any one might perish who in the mercy of God understood this even in that
early age; but that, destined though he was to punishment, owing to the dominion of death,
and manifested, too, as guilty through his own violation of the law, he might seek God’s
help, and so where sin abounded, grace might much more abound,1967 even the grace which
alone delivers from the body of this death.1968 [XXV.] Yet, notwithstanding this, although
not even the law which Moses gave was able to liberate any man from the dominion of death,
there were even then, too, at the time of the law, men of God who were not living under the
terror and conviction and punishment of the law, but under the delight and healing and
liberation of grace. Some there were who said, “I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my
mother conceive me;”1969 and, “There is no rest in my bones, by reason of my sins;”1970
and, “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;”1971
and, “Stablish me with Thy directing Spirit;”1972 and, “Take not Thy Holy Spirit from
me.”1973 There were some, again, who said: “I believed, therefore have I spoken.”1974 For
they too were cleansed with the self-same faith with which we ourselves are. Whence the
apostle also says: “We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believe,
and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.”1975 Out of very faith was
it said, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Em-

manuel,”1976 “which is, being interpreted, God with us.”1977 Out of very faith too was it
said concerning Him: “As a bridegroom He cometh out of His chamber; as a giant did He
exult to run His course. His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and His circuit
runs to the other end of heaven; and no one is hidden from His heat.”1978 Out of very faith,
again, was it said to Him: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness
is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.”1979 By the
self-same Spirit of faith were all these things foreseen by them as to happen, whereby they
are believed by us as having happened. They, indeed, who were able in faithful love to foretell
these things to us were not themselves partakers of them. The Apostle Peter says, “Why
tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor
we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall
be saved, even as they.”1980 Now on what principle does he make this statement, if it be not
because even they were saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and not the law
of Moses, from which comes not the cure, but only the knowledge of sin?1981 Now, however,
the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the
prophets.1982 If, therefore, it is now manifested, it even then existed, but it was hidden. This
concealment was symbolized by the veil of the temple. When Christ was dying, this veil was
rent asunder,1983 to signify the full revelation of Him. Even of old, therefore there existed
amongst the people of God this grace of the one Mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus; but like the rain in the fleece which God sets apart for His inheritance,1984 not
of debt, but of His own will, it was latently present, but is now patently visible amongst all
nations as its “floor,” the fleece being dry,—in other words, the Jewish people having become
reprobate.1985</p>

<p>We must not therefore divide the times, as Pelagius and his disciples do, who say that
men first lived righteously by nature, then under the law, thirdly under grace,—by nature
meaning all the long time from Adam before the giving of the law. “For then,” say they, “the
Creator was known by the guidance of reason; and the rule of living rightly was carried
written in the hearts of men, not in the law of the letter, but of nature. But men’s manners
became corrupt; and then,” they say, “when nature now tarnished began to be insufficient,
the law was added to it whereby as by a moon the original lustre was restored to nature after
its blush was impaired. But after the habit of sinning had too much prevailed among men,
and the law was unequal to the task of curing it, Christ came; and the Physician Himself,
through His own self, and not through His disciples, brought relief to the malady at its most
desperate development.”</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Christ’s Incarnation Was of Avail to the Fathers, Even Though It Had
Not Yet Happened.</head>
<p>By disputation of this sort, they attempt to exclude the ancient saints from the grace of
the Mediator, as if the man Christ Jesus were not the Mediator between God and those men;
on the ground that, not having yet taken flesh of the Virgin’s womb, He was not yet man at
the time when those righteous men lived. If this, however, were true, in vain would the
apostle say: “By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in
Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”1986 For inasmuch as those ancient
saints, according to the vain conceits of these men, found their nature self-sufficient, and
required not the man Christ to be their Mediator to reconcile them to God, so neither shall
they be made alive in Him, to whose body they are shown not to belong as members, according
to the statement that it was on man’s account that He became man. If, however, as the
Truth says through His apostles, even as all die in Adam, even so shall all be made alive in
Christ; forasmuch as the resurrection of the dead comes through the one man, even as death
comes through the other man; what Christian man can be bold enough to doubt that even
those righteous men who pleased God in the more remote periods of the human race are
destined to attain to the resurrection of eternal life, and not eternal death, because they shall
be made alive in Christ? that they are made alive in Christ, because they belong to the body
of Christ? that they belong to the body of Christ, because Christ is the head even to them?1987
and that Christ is the head even to them, because there is but one Mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus? But this He could not have been to them, unless through
His grace they had believed in His resurrection. And how could they have done this, if they
had been ignorant that He was to come in the flesh, and if they had not by this faith lived
justly and piously? Now, if the incarnation of Christ could be of no concern to them, on the
ground that it had not yet come about, it must follow that Christ’s judgment can be of no
concern to us, because it has not yet taken place. But if we shall stand at the right hand of
Christ through our faith in His judgment, which has not yet transpired, but is to come to
pass, it follows that those ancient saints are members of Christ through their faith in His
resurrection, which had not in their day happened, but which was one day to come to pass.</p>

<head>Chapter 32 <del>XXVII.</del>—He Shows by the Example of Abraham that the Ancient Saints
Believed in the Incarnation of Christ.</head>
<p>For it must not be supposed that those saints of old only profited by Christ’s divinity,
which was ever existent, and not also by the revelation of His humanity, which had not yet
come to pass. What the Lord Jesus says, “Abraham desired to see my day, and he saw it, and
was glad,”1988 meaning by the phrase his day to understand his time, affords of course a
clear testimony that Abraham was fully imbued with belief in His incarnation. It is in respect
of this that He has a “time;” for His divinity exceeds all time, for it was by it that all times
were created. If, however, any one supposes that the phrase in question must be understood
of that eternal “day” which is limited by no morrow, and preceded by no yesterday,—in a
word, of the very eternity in which He is co-eternal with the Father,—how would Abraham
really desire this, unless he was aware that there was to be a future mortality belonging to
Him whose eternity he wished for? Or, perhaps, some one would confine the meaning of
the phrase so far as to say, that nothing else is meant in the Lord’s saying, “He desired to
see my day,” than “He desired to see me,” who am the never-ending Day, or the unfailing
Light, as when we mention the life of the Son, concerning which it is said in the Gospel: “So
hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself.”1989 Here the life is nothing less than
Himself. So we understand the Son Himself to be the life, when He said, “I am the way, the
truth, and the life;”1990 of whom also it was said, “He is the true God, and eternal life.”1991
Supposing, then, that Abraham desired to see this equal divinity of the Son’s with the
Father, without any precognition of His coming in the flesh—as certain philosophers sought
Him, who knew nothing of His flesh—can that other act of Abraham, when he orders his
servant to place his hand under his thigh, and to swear by the God of heaven,1992 be rightly
understood by any one otherwise than as showing that Abraham well knew that the flesh
in which the God of heaven was to come was the offspring of that very thigh?1993</p>

the last of these passages, the A.V. phrase, “of his body begotten,” is וכׁרֵיְ יאציֹּ , the offspring of his thigh. Abraham
was the first to use this form of adjuration; after him his grandson Jacob, Gen. xlvii. 29. The comment
of Augustin in the text, which he repeats elsewhere (see his Sermon 75), occurs also in other Fathers, e.g. Jerome,
Theodoret, Ambrose (De Abrahamo, i. cap. ult.), Prosper (Prædicat. i. 7), and Gregory the Great, who says: “He</note>

<p>Of this flesh and blood Melchizedek also, when he blessed Abram himself,1994 gave the
testimony which is very well known to Christian believers, so that long afterwards it was
said to Christ in the Psalms: “Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.”1995
This was not then an accomplished fact, but was still future; yet that faith of the fathers,
which is the self-same faith as our own, used to chant it. Now, to all who find death in Adam,
Christ is of this avail, that He is the Mediator for life. He is, however, not a Mediator, because
He is equal with the Father; for in this respect He is Himself as far distant from us as the
Father; and how can there be any medium where the distance is the very same? Therefore
the apostle does not say, “There is one Mediator between God and men, even Jesus Christ;”
but his words are, “The Man Christ Jesus.”1996 He is the Mediator, then, in that He is
man,—inferior to the Father, by so much as He is nearer to ourselves, and superior to us,
by so much as He is nearer to the Father. This is more openly expressed thus: “He is inferior
to the Father, because in the form of a servant;”1997 superior to us, because without spot of

<p>Now, whoever maintains that human nature at any period required not the second
Adam for its physician, because it was not corrupted in the first Adam, is convicted as an
enemy to the grace of God; not in a question where doubt or error might be compatible
with soundness of belief, but in that very rule of faith which makes us Christians. How
happens it, then, that the human nature, which first existed, is praised by these men as being
so far less tainted with evil manners? How is it that they overlook the fact that men were
even then sunk in so many intolerable sins, that, with the exception of one man of God and
his wife, and three sons and their wives, the whole world was in God’s just judgment destroyed
by the flood, even as the little land of Sodom was afterwards with fire?1998 From the
moment, then, when “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death
passed upon all men, in whom all sinned,”1999 the entire mass of our nature was ruined
beyond doubt, and fell into the possession of its destroyer. And from him no one—no, not
one—has been delivered, or is being delivered, or ever will be delivered, except by the grace
of the Redeemer.</p>

<head>Chapter 35 <del>XXX.</del>—Why the Circumcision of Infants Was Enjoined Under Pain
of So Great a Punishment.</head>
<p>The Scripture does not inform us whether before Abraham’s time righteous men or
their children were marked by any bodily or visible sign.2000 Abraham himself, indeed, received
the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith.2001 And he received it
with this accompanying injunction: All the male infants of his household were from that
very time to be circumcised, while fresh from their mother’s womb, on the eighth day from
their birth;2002 so that even they who were not yet able with the heart to believe unto right-
eousness, should nevertheless receive the seal of the righteousness of faith. And this command
was imposed with so fearful a sanction, that God said: “That soul shall be cut off from his
people, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised on the eighth day.”2003 If inquiry be
made into the justice of so terrible a penalty, will not the entire argument of these men about
free will, and the laudable soundness and purity of nature, however cleverly maintained,
fall to pieces, struck down and fractured to atoms? For, pray tell me, what evil has an infant
committed of his own will, that, for the negligence of another in not circumcising him, he
himself must be condemned, and with so severe a condemnation, that that soul must be cut
off from his people? It was not of any temporal death that this fear was inflicted, since of
righteous persons, when they died, it used rather to be said, “And he was gathered unto his
people;”2004 or, “He was gathered to his fathers:”2005 for no attempt to separate a man from
his people is long formidable to him, when his own people is itself the people of God.</p>

<p>What, then, is the purport of so severe a condemnation, when no wilful sin has been
committed? For it is not as certain Platonists have thought, because every such infant is thus
requited in his soul for what it did of its own wilfulness previous to the present life, as having
possessed previous to its present bodily state a free choice of living either well or ill; since
the Apostle Paul says most plainly, that before they were born they did neither good nor
evil.2006 On what account, therefore, is an infant rightly punished with such ruin, if it be
not because he belongs to the mass of perdition, and is properly regarded as born of Adam,
condemned under the bond of the ancient debt unless he has been released from the bond,
not according to debt, but according to grace? And what grace but God’s, through our Lord
Jesus Christ? Now there was a forecast of His coming undoubtedly contained not only in
other sacred institutions 2007 of the ancient Jews, but also in their circumcision of the foreskin.
For the eighth day, in the recurrence of weeks, became the Lord’s day, on which the Lord
arose from the dead; and Christ was the rock2008 whence was formed the stony blade for
the circumcision;2009 and the flesh of the foreskin was the body of sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 37 <del>XXXII.</del>—In What Sense Christ is Called “Sin.”</head>
<p>There was a change of the sacramental ordinances made after the coming of Him whose
advent they prefigured; but there was no change in the Mediator’s help, who, even previous
to His coming in the flesh, all along delivered the ancient members of His body by their
faith in His incarnation; and in respect of ourselves too, though we were dead in sins and
in the uncircumcision of our flesh, we are quickened together in Christ, in whom we are
circumcised with the circumcision not made with the hand,2010 but such as was prefigured
by the old manual circumcision, that the body of sin might be done away2011 which was
born with us from Adam. The propagation of a condemned origin condemns us, unless we
are cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh, in which He was sent without sin, who nevertheless
concerning sin condemned sin, having been made sin for us.2012 Accordingly the apostle
says: “We beseech you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled unto God. For He hath made Him
to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in
Him.”2013 God, therefore, to whom we are reconciled, has made Him to be sin for us,—that
is to say, a sacrifice by which our sins may be remitted; for by sins are designated the sacrifices
for sins. And indeed He was sacrificed for our sins, the only one among men who had no
sins, even as in those early times one was sought for among the flocks to prefigure the
Faultless One who was to come to heal our offences. On whatever day, therefore, an infant
may be baptized after his birth, he is as if circumcised on the eighth day; inasmuch as he is
circumcised in Him who rose again the third day indeed after He was crucified, but the
eighth according to the weeks. He is circumcised for the putting off of the body of sin; in
other words, that the grace of spiritual regeneration may do away with the debt which the
contagion of carnal generation contracted. “For no one is pure from uncleanness” (what
uncleanness, pray, but that of sin?), “not even the infant, whose life is but that of a single
day upon the earth.”2014</p>

<head>Chapter 38 <del>XXXIII.</del>—Original Sin Does Not Render Marriage Evil.</head>
<p>But they argue thus, saying: “Is not, then, marriage an evil, and the man that is produced
by marriage not God’s work?” As if the good of the married life were that disease of concupiscence
with which they who know not God love their wives—a course which the apostle
forbids;2015 and not rather that conjugal chastity, by which carnal lust is reduced to the
good purposes of the appointed procreation of children. Or as if, forsooth, a man could
possibly be anything but God’s work, not only when born in wedlock, but even if he be
produced in fornication or adultery. In the present inquiry, however, when the question is
not for what a Creator is necessary, but for what a Saviour, we have not to consider what
good there is in the procreation of nature, but what evil there is in sin, whereby our nature
has been certainly corrupted. No doubt the two are generated simultaneously—both nature
and nature’s corruption; one of which is good, the other evil. The one comes to us from the
bounty of the Creator, the other is contracted from the condemnation of our origin; the one
has its cause in the good-will of the Supreme God, the other in the depraved will of the first
man; the one exhibits God as the maker of the creature, the other exhibits God as the punisher
of disobedience: in short, the very same Christ was the maker of man for the creation
of the one, and was made2016man for the healing of the other.</p>

<head>Chapter 39 <del>XXXIV.</del>—Three Things Good and Laudable in Matrimony.</head>
<p>Marriage, therefore, is a good in all the things which are proper to the married state.
And these are three: it is the ordained means of procreation, it is the guarantee2017 of chastity,
it is the bond of union.2018 In respect of its ordination for generation the Scripture says, “I
will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house;”2019 as regards
its guaranteeing chastity, it is said of it, “The wife hath not power of her own body, but the
husband; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife;”2020
and considered as the bond of union: “What God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.”2021 Touching these points, we do not forget that we have treated at sufficient
length, with whatever ability the Lord has given us, in other works of ours, which are not
unknown to you.2022 In relation to them all the Scripture has this general praise: “Marriage
is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled.”2023 For, inasmuch as the wedded state is good,
insomuch does it produce a very large amount of good in respect of the evil of concupiscence;
for it is not lust, but reason, which makes a good use of concupiscence. Now lust lies in that
law of the “disobedient” members which the apostle notes as “warring against the law of
the mind;”2024 whereas reason lies in that law of the wedded state which makes good use
of concupiscence. If, however, it were impossible for any good to arise out of evil, God could
not create man out of the embraces of adultery. As, therefore, the damnable evil of adultery,
whenever man is born in it, is not chargeable on God, who certainly amidst man’s evil work
actually produces a good work; so, likewise, all which causes shame in that rebellion of the
members which brought the accusing blush on those who after their sin covered these
members with the fig-tree leaves,2025 is not laid to the charge of marriage, by virtue of which
the conjugal embrace is not only allowable, but is even useful and honourable; but it is imputable
to the sin of that disobedience which was followed by the penalty of man’s finding
his own members emulating against himself that very disobedience which he had practised
against God. Then, abashed at their action, since they moved no more at the bidding of his
rational will, but at their own arbitrary choice as it were, instigated by lust, he devised the

covering which should conceal such of them as he judged to be worthy of shame. For man,
as the handiwork of God, deserved not confusion of face; nor were the members which it
seemed fit to the Creator to form and appoint by any means designed to bring the blush to
the creature. Accordingly, that simple nudity was displeasing neither to God nor to man:
there was nothing to be ashamed of, because nothing at first accrued which deserved punishment.</p>

<head>Chapter 40 <del>XXXV.</del>—Marriage Existed Before Sin Was Committed. How God’s
Blessing Operated in Our First Parents.</head>
<p>There was, however, undoubtedly marriage, even when sin had no prior existence; and
for no other reason was it that woman, and not a second man, was created as a help for the
man. Moreover, those words of God, “Be fruitful and multiply,”2026 are not prophetic of
sins to be condemned, but a benediction upon the fertility of marriage. For by these ineffable
words of His, I mean by the divine methods which are inherent in the truth of His wisdom
by which all things were made, God endowed the primeval pair with their seminal power.
Suppose, however, that nature had not been dishonoured by sin, God forbid that we should
think that marriages in Paradise must have been such, that in them the procreative members
would be excited by the mere ardour of lust, and not by the command of the will for producing
offspring,—as the foot is for walking, the hand for labour, and the tongue for speech.
Nor, as now happens, would the chastity of virginity be corrupted to the conception of offspring
by the force of a turbid heat, but it would rather be submissive to the power of the
gentlest love; and thus there would be no pain, no blood-effusion of the concumbent virgin,
as there would also be no groan of the parturient mother. This, however, men refuse to believe,
because it has not been verified in the actual condition of our mortal state. Nature,
having been vitiated by sin, has never experienced an instance of that primeval purity. But
we speak to faithful men, who have learnt to believe the inspired Scriptures, even though
no examples are adduced of actual reality. For how could I now possibly prove that a man
was made of the dust, without any parents, and a wife formed for him out of his own side?2027
And yet faith takes on trust what the eye no longer discovers.</p>

<head>Chapter 41 <del>XXXVI.</del>—Lust and Travail Come from Sin. Whence Our Members
Became a Cause of Shame.</head>
<p>Granted, therefore, that we have no means of showing both that the nuptial acts of that
primeval marriage were quietly discharged, undisturbed by lustful passion, and that the
motion of the organs of generation, like that of any other members of the body, was not
instigated by the ardour of lust, but directed by the choice of the will (which would have
continued such with marriage had not the disgrace of sin intervened); still, from all that is
stated in the sacred Scriptures on divine authority, we have reasonable grounds for believing
that such was the original condition of wedded life. Although, it is true, I am not told that
the nuptial embrace was unattended with prurient desire; as also I do not find it on record
that parturition was unaccompanied with groans and pain, or that actual birth led not to
future death; yet, at the same time, if I follow the verity of the Holy Scriptures, the travail
of the mother and the death of the human offspring would never have supervened if sin had
not preceded. Nor would that have happened which abashed the man and woman when
they covered their loins; because in the same sacred records it is expressly written that the
sin was first committed, and then immediately followed this hiding of their shame.2028 For
unless some indelicacy of motion had announced to their eyes—which were of course not
closed, though not open to this point, that is, not attentive—that those particular members
should be corrected, they would not have perceived anything on their own persons, which
God had entirely made worthy of all praise, that called for either shame or concealment. If,
indeed, the sin had not first occurred which they had dared to commit in their disobedience,
there would not have followed the disgrace which their shame would fain conceal.</p>

<head>Chapter 42 <del>XXXVII.</del>—The Evil of Lust Ought Not to Be Ascribed to Marriage.
The Three Good Results of the Nuptial Ordinance: Offspring, Chastity, and the
Sacramental Union.</head>
<p>It is then manifest that that must not be laid to the account of marriage, even in the
absence of which, marriage would still have existed. The good of marriage is not taken away
by the evil, although the evil is by marriage turned to a good use. Such, however, is the
present condition of mortal men, that the connubial intercourse and lust are at the same
time in action; and on this account it happens, that as the lust is blamed, so also the nuptial
commerce, however lawful and honourable, is thought to be reprehensible by those persons
who either are unwilling or unable to draw the distinction between them. They are, moreover,
inattentive to that good of the nuptial state which is the glory of matrimony; I mean offspring,
chastity, and the pledge.2029 The evil, however, at which even marriage blushes for shame
is not the fault of marriage, but of the lust of the flesh. Yet because without this evil it is
impossible to effect the good purpose of marriage, even the procreation of children,
whenever this process is approached, secrecy is sought, witnesses removed, and even the
presence of the very children which happen to be born of the process is avoided as soon as
they reach the age of observation. Thus it comes to pass that marriage is permitted to effect
all that is lawful in its state, only it must not forget to conceal all that is improper. Hence it
follows that infants, although incapable of sinning, are yet not born without the contagion
of sin,—not, indeed, because of what is lawful, but on account of that which is unseemly:
for from what is lawful nature is born; from what is unseemly, sin. Of the nature so born,
God is the Author, who created man, and who united male and female under the nuptial
law; but of the sin the author is the subtlety of the devil who deceives, and the will of the
man who consents.</p>

<head>Chapter 43 <del>XXXVIII.</del>—Human Offspring, Even Previous to Birth, Under Condemnation
at the Very Root. Uses of Matrimony Undertaken for Mere Pleasure Not
Without Venial Fault.</head>
<p>Where God did nothing else than by a just sentence to condemn the man who wilfully
sins, together with his stock; there also, as a matter of course, whatsoever was even not yet
born is justly condemned in its sinful root. In this condemned stock carnal generation holds
every man; and from it nothing but spiritual regeneration liberates him. In the case, therefore,
of regenerate parents, if they continue in the same state of grace, it will undoubtedly work
no injurious consequence, by reason of the remission of sins which has been bestowed upon
them, unless they make a perverse use of it,—not alone all kinds of lawless corruptions, but
even in the marriage state itself, whenever husband and wife toil at procreation, not from
the desire of natural propagation of their species, but are mere slaves to the gratification of
their lust out of very wantonness. As for the permission which the apostle gives to husbands
and wives, “not to defraud one another, except with consent for a time, that they may have
leisure for prayer,”2030 he concedes it by way of indulgent allowance, and not as a command;
but this very form of the concession evidently implies some degree of fault. The connubial
embrace, however, which marriage-contracts point to as intended for the procreation of
children, considered in itself simply, and without any reference to fornication, is good and
right; because, although it is by reason of this body of death (which is unrenewed as yet by
the resurrection) impracticable without a certain amount of bestial motion, which puts
human nature to the blush, yet the embrace is not after all a sin in itself, when reason applies
the concupiscence to a good end, and is not overmastered to evil.</p>

<head>Chapter 44 <del>XXXIX.</del>—Even the Children of the Regenerate Born in Sin. The Effect
of Baptism.</head>
<p>This concupiscence of the flesh would be prejudicial,2031 just in so far as it is present
in us,2032 if the remission of sins were not so beneficial2033 that while it is present in men,
both as born and as born again, it may in the former be prejudicial as well as present, but
in the latter present simply but never prejudicial. In the unregenerate it is prejudicial to such
an extent indeed, that, unless they are born again, no advantage can accrue to them from
being born of regenerate parents. The fault of our nature remains in our offspring so deeply
impressed as to make it guilty, even when the guilt of the self-same fault has been washed
away in the parent by the remission of sins—until every defect which ends in sin by the
consent of the human will is consumed and done away in the last regeneration. This will be
identical with that renovation of the very flesh itself which is promised in its future resurrection,
when we shall not only commit no sins, but be even free from those corrupt desires
which lead us to sin by yielding consent to them. To this blessed consummation advances
are even now made by us, through the grace of that holy laver which we have put within
our reach. The same regeneration which now renews our spirit, so that all our past sins are
remitted, will by and by also operate, as might be expected, to the renewal to eternal life of
that very flesh, by the resurrection of which to an incorruptible state the incentives of all
sins will be purged out of our nature. But this salvation is as yet only accomplished in hope:
it is not realized in fact; it is not in present possession, but it is looked forward to with patience.
[XL.] And thus there is a whole and perfect cleansing, in the self-same baptismal
laver, not only of all the sins remitted now in our baptism, which make us guilty owing to
the consent we yield to wrong desires, and to the sinful acts in which they issue; but of these
said wrong desires also, which, if not consented to by us, would contract no guilt of sin, and
which, though not in this present life removed, will yet have no existence in the life beyond.</p>

<head>Chapter 45.—Man’s Deliverance Suited to the Character of His Captivity.</head>
<p>The guilt, therefore, of that corruption of which we are speaking will remain in the
carnal offspring of the regenerate, until in them also it be washed away in the laver of regeneration.
A regenerate man does not regenerate, but generates, sons according to the flesh;
and thus he transmits to his posterity, not the condition of the regenerated, but only of the
generated. Therefore, be a man guilty of unbelief, or a perfect believer, he does not in either
case beget faithful children, but sinners; in the same way that the seeds, not only of a wild
olive, but also of a cultivated one, produce not cultivated olives, but wild ones. So, likewise,
his first birth holds a man in that bondage from which nothing but his second birth delivers
him. The devil holds him, Christ liberates him: Eve’s deceiver holds him, Mary’s Son frees
him: he holds him, who approached the man through the woman; He frees him, who was
born of a woman that never approached a man: he holds him, who injected into the woman
the cause of lust; He liberates him, who without any lust was conceived in the woman. The
former was able to hold all men in his grasp through one; nor does any deliver them out of
his power but One, whom he was unable to grasp. The very sacraments indeed of the Church,
which she2034 administers with due ceremony, according to the authority of very ancient
tradition (so that these men, notwithstanding their opinion that the sacraments are imitatively
rather than really used in the case of infants, still do not venture to reject them with open
disapproval),—the very sacraments, I say, of the holy Church show plainly enough that infants,
even when fresh from the womb, are delivered from the bondage of the devil through
the grace of Christ. For, to say nothing of the fact that they are baptized for the remission
of sins by no fallacious, but by a true and faithful mystery, there is previously wrought on
them the exorcism and the exsufflation of the hostile power, which they profess to renounce
by the mouth of those who bring them to baptism. Now, by all these consecrated and evident
signs of hidden realities, they are shown to pass from their worst oppressor to their most
excellent Redeemer, who, by taking on Himself our infirmity in our behalf, has bound the
strong man, that He may spoil his goods;2035 seeing that the weakness of God is stronger,
not only than men, but also than angels. While, therefore, God delivers small as well as great,
He shows in both instances that the apostle spoke under the direction of the Truth. For it
is not merely adults, but little babes too whom He rescues from the power of darkness, in
order to transfer them to the kingdom of God’s dear Son.2036</p>

<head>Chapter 46.—Difficulty of Believing Original Sin. Man’s Vice is a Beast’s Nature.</head>
<p>No one should feel surprise, and ask: “Why does God’s goodness create anything for
the devil’s malignity to take possession of?” The truth is, God’s gift is bestowed on the
seminal elements of His creature with the same bounty wherewith “He maketh His sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”2037 It is
with so large a bounty that God has blessed the very seeds, and by blessing has constituted
them. Nor has this blessing been eliminated out of our excellent nature by a fault which
puts us under condemnation. Owing, indeed, to God’s justice, who punishes, this fatal flaw
has so far prevailed, that men are born with the fault of original sin; but yet its influence has
not extended so far as to stop the birth of men. Just so does it happen in persons of adult
age: whatever sins they commit, do not eliminate his manhood from man; nay, God’s work
continues still good, however evil be the deeds of the impious. For although “man being
placed in honour abideth not; and being without understanding, is compared with the beasts,
and is like them,”2038 yet the resemblance is not so absolute that he becomes a beast. There
is a comparison, no doubt, between the two; but it is not by reason of nature, but through
vice—not vice in the beast, but in nature. For so excellent is a man in comparison with a
beast, that man’s vice is beast’s nature; still man’s nature is never on this account changed
into beast’s nature. God, therefore, condemns man because of the fault wherewithal his
nature is disgraced, and not because of his nature, which is not destroyed in consequence
of its fault. Heaven forbid that we should think beasts are obnoxious to the sentence of
condemnation! It is only proper that they should be free from our misery, inasmuch as they
cannot partake of our blessedness. What, then, is there surprising or unjust in man’s being
subjected to an impure spirit—not on account of nature, but on account of that impurity
of his which he has contracted in the stain of his birth, and which proceeds, not from the
divine work, but from the will of man;—since also the impure spirit itself is a good thing
considered as spirit, but evil in that it is impure? For the one is of God, and is His work,
while the other emanates from man’s own will. The stronger nature, therefore, that is, the
angelic one, keeps the lower, or human, nature in subjection, by reason of the association
of vice with the latter. Accordingly the Mediator, who was stronger than the angels, became
weak for man’s sake. 2039 So that the pride of the Destroyer is destroyed by the humility of
the Redeemer; and he who makes his boast over the sons of men of his angelic strength, is
vanquished by the Son of God in the human weakness which He assumed.</p>

<head>Chapter 47 <del>XLI.</del>—Sentences from Ambrose in Favour of Original Sin.</head>
<p>And now that we are about to bring this book to a conclusion, we think it proper to do
on this subject of Original Sin what we did before in our treatise On Grace,2040—adduce
in evidence against the injurious talk of these persons that servant of God, the Archbishop
Ambrose, whose faith is proclaimed by Pelagius to be the most perfect among the writers
of the Latin Church; for grace is more especially honoured in doing away with original sin.
In the work which the saintly Ambrose wrote, Concerning the Resurrection, he says: “I fell
in Adam, in Adam was I expelled from Paradise, in Adam I died; and He does not recall me
unless He has found me in Adam,—so as that, as I am obnoxious to the guilt of sin in him,
and subject to death, I may be also justified in Christ.”2041 Then, again, writing against the
Novatians, he says: “We men are all of us born in sin; our very origin is in sin; as you may
read when David says, ‘Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
me.’2042 Hence it is that Paul’s flesh is ‘a body of death;’2043 even as he says himself, ‘Who
shall deliver me from the body of this death?’ Christ’s flesh, however, has condemned sin,
which He experienced not by being born, and which by dying He crucified, that in our flesh
there might be justification through grace, where previously there was impurity through
sin.”2044 The same holy man also, in his Exposition of Isaiah, speaking of Christ, says:
“Therefore as man He was tried in all things, and in the likeness of men He endured all
things; but as born of the Spirit, He was free from sin. For every man is a liar, and no one
but God alone is without sin. It is therefore an observed and settled fact, that no man born
of a man and a woman, that is, by means of their bodily union, is seen to be free from sin.
Whosoever, indeed, is free from sin, is free also from a conception and birth of this kind.”2045
Moreover, when expounding the Gospel according to Luke, he says: “It was no cohabitation
with a husband which opened the secrets of the Virgin’s womb; rather was it the Holy Ghost
which infused immaculate seed into her unviolated womb. For the Lord Jesus alone of those
who are born of woman is holy, inasmuch as He experienced not the contact of earthly
corruption, by reason of the novelty of His immaculate birth; nay, He repelled it by His
heavenly majesty.” 2046</p>

<p>These words, however, of the man of God are contradicted by Pelagius, notwithstanding
all his commendation of his author, when he himself declares that “we are procreated, as
without virtue, so without vice.”2047 What remains, then, but that Pelagius should condemn
and renounce this error of his; or else be sorry that he has quoted Ambrose in the way he
has? Inasmuch, however, as the blessed Ambrose, catholic bishop as he is, has expressed
himself in the above-quoted passages in accordance with the catholic faith, it follows that
Pelagius, along with his disciple Coelestius, was justly condemned by the authority of the
catholic Church for having turned aside from the true way of faith, since he repented not
for having bestowed commendation on Ambrose, and for having at the same time entertained
opinions in opposition to him. I know full well with what insatiable avidity you2048 read

by maintaining Original Sin. These books are entitled, On Marriage and Concupiscence. We
maintain that marriage is good; and that it must not be supposed that the concupisence of
the flesh, or “the law in our members which wars against the law of mind,” 2049 is a fault of
marriage. Conjugal chastity makes a good use of the evil of concupiscence in the procreation
of children. My first treatise contained two books. The first of them found its way into the
hands of Julianus the Pelagian, who wrote four books in opposition to it. Out of these,
somebody extracted sundry passages, and sent them to Count Valerius; he handed them to
us, and after I had received them I wrote a second book in answer to these extracts. The first
book of this work of mine opens with these words: “Our new heretics, most beloved son
Valerius,” while the second begins thus: “Amid the cares of your duty as a soldier.”</p>

<head>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER ON THE FOLLOWING
TREATISE.</head>
<p>On revising these two Books, which he addressed to the Count Valerius, Augustin placed
them immediately after his reply to the discourse of the Arians, which was affixed to the
Proceedings with Emeritus.2050 Now these proceedings are stated to have taken place on the
20th of September, in the year of our Lord 418.2051 There can be no doubt, then, that these
subjoined books—or, at any rate, the former of them—were written either at the close of
the year 418, or in the beginning of the year 419. For, concerning this first book, Augustin
says himself: “This book of mine, however, which he [Julianus] says he answered in four
books, I wrote after the condemnation of Pelagius and Coelestius. This,” he adds, “I have
deemed it right to mention, because he declares that my words had been used by the enemies
of the truth to bring it into odium. Let no one, therefore, suppose that it was owing to this
book of mine that condemnation had been passed on the new heretics who are enemies of
the grace of Christ.”2052 From these words one may see at once that this first book was
published about the same time as the condemnation of the Pelagians in the year 418.</p>
<p>Soon after its publication it began to be assailed by the Pelagians, who observed that its
perusal was producing in the minds of the catholics much odium against their heresy. One
of them, Julianus,2053 influenced with a warm desire of furthering the heretical movement,
attacked the first book of Augustin’s treatise in four books of his own. Out of these, sundry
extracts were culled by some interested person, and forwarded to Count Valerius. Valerius
despatched them from Ravenna to Rome, to Alypius,2054 in order that he, on returning to
Africa, might hand them to Augustin for the purpose of an early refutation, together with
a letter in which Valerius thanked Augustin for the previous work which he also mentioned.
Augustin saw at once that these extracts had been taken out of the work of Julianus; and,
although he preferred reserving his answer to the selections till he had received the entire
work from which they were culled, he still thought that he was bound to avoid all delay in
satisfying the Count Valerius. Without loss of time, therefore, he drew up in answer his
second book, with the same title as before, On Marriage and Concupiscence, which, as we
think, must be assigned to the year 420, since the holy doctor wrote it immediately after the

expression of thanks for the first book; for it is clearly improbable that Valerius should have
waited two years or more to make the acknowledgment of his gratitude.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Valerius whom Augustin dignifies with the title of Illustrious as well as
Count, was much employed in public life—not, to be sure, in the forum, but in the field;
and from this circumstance we find it difficult to accede to the opinion that supposes him
to have been the same person with the Valerius who was Count of the Private Estate in the
year 425, Consul in 432, and lastly Master of the Offices under Theodosius the younger in

<head>A LETTER2055 ADDRESSED TO THE COUNT VALERIUS,</head>
<p>ON AUGUSTIN’S FORWARDING TO HIM WHAT HE CALLS HIS FIRST BOOK “ON
MARRIAGE AND CONCUPISCENCE.”</p>
<p>To the illustrious and deservedly eminent Lord and his most dearly beloved son in the love of
Christ, Valerius, Augustin sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>1. While I was chafing at the long disappointment of receiving no acknowledgments
from your Highness of the many letters which I had written to you, I all at once received
three letters from your Grace,—one by the hand of my fellow bishop Vindemialis, which
was not meant for me only, and two, soon afterwards, through my brother presbyter Firmus.
This holy man, who is bound to me, as you may have ascertained from his own lips, by the
ties of a most intimate love, had much conversation with me about your excellence, and
gave me undoubted proofs of his complete knowledge of your character “in the bowels of
Christ;”2056 by these means he had sight, not only of the letters of which the fore-mentioned
bishop and he himself had been the bearers, but also of those which we expressed our disappointment
at not having received. Now his information respecting you was all the more
pleasant to us, inasmuch as he gave me to understand, what it was out of your power to do,
that you would not, even at my earnest request for an answer, become the extoller of your
own praises, contrary to the permission of Holy Scripture.2057 But I ought myself to hesitate
to write to you in this strain, lest I should incur the suspicion of flattering you, my illustrious
and deservedly eminent lord and dearly beloved son in the love of Christ.</p>
<p>2. Now, as to your praises in Christ, or rather Christ’s praises in you, see what delight
and joy it was to me to hear of them from him, who could neither deceive me because of
his fidelity to me, nor be ignorant of them by reason of his friendship with you. But other
testimony, which though inferior in amount and certainty has still reached my ear from
divers quarters, assures me how sound and catholic is your faith; how devout your hope of
the future; how great your love to God and the brethren; how humble your mind amid the
highest honours, as you do not trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, and art rich
in good works;2058 how your house is a rest and comfort of the saints, and a terror to evildoers;
how great is your care that no man lay snares for Christ’s members (either among
His old enemies or those of more recent days), although he use Christ’s name as a cloak for

his wiles; and at the same time, though you give no quarter to the error of these enemies,
how provident you are to secure their salvation. This and the like, we frequently hear, as I
have already said, even from others; but at the present moment we have, by means of the
above-mentioned brother, received a fuller and more trustworthy knowledge.</p>
<p>3. Touching, however, the subject of conjugal purity, that we might be able to bestow
our commendation and love upon you for it, could we possibly listen to the information of
any one but some bosom friend of your own, who had no mere superficial acquaintance
with you, but knew your innermost life? Concerning, therefore, this excellent gift of God
to you, I am delighted to converse with you with more frankness and at greater length. I am
quite sure that I shall not prove burdensome to you, even if I send you a prolix treatise, the
perusal of which will only ensure a longer converse between us. For this have I discovered,
that amidst your manifold and weighty cares you pursue your reading with ease and pleasure;
and that you take great delight in any little performances of ours, even if they are addressed
to other persons, whenever they have chanced to fall into your hands. Whatever, therefore,
is addressed to yourself, in which I can speak to you as it were personally, you will deign
both to notice with greater attention, and to receive with a higher pleasure. From the perusal,
then, of this letter, turn to the book which I send with it. It will in its very commencement,
in a more convenient manner, intimate to your Reverence the reason, both why it has been
written, and why it has been submitted specially to your consideration.</p>

<head>ON MARRIAGE AND CONCUPISCENCE,
In Two Books,
addressed to the count valerius
BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;
written in 419 AND 420.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="1">
<head>Book I.2059</head>
<p>Wherein He expounds the peculiar and natural blessings of marriage. He shows that among
these blessings must not be reckoned fleshly concupiscence; insomuch as this is wholly evil,
such as does not proceed from the very nature of marriage, but is an accident thereof
arising from original sin. This evil, notwithstanding, is rightly employed by marriage for
the procreation of children. But, as the result of this concupiscence, it comes to pass that,
even from the lawful marriage of the children of God, men are not born children of God,
but of the world, and are bound with the chain of sin, although their parents have been
liberated therefrom by grace; and are led captive by the devil, if they be not in like manner
rescued by the self-same grace of Christ. He explains how it is that concupiscence remains
in the baptized in act though not in guilt. He teaches, that by the sanctity of baptism, not
merely this original guilt, but all other sins of men whatever, are taken away. He lastly
quotes the authority of Ambrose to show that the evil of concupiscence must be distinguished
from the good of marriage.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Concerning the Argument of This Treatise.</head>
<p>Our new heretics, my dearest son Valerius, who maintain that infants born in the flesh
have no need of that medicine of Christ whereby sins are healed, are constantly affirming,
in their excessive hatred of us, that we condemn marriage and that divine procedure by
which God creates human beings by means of men and women, inasmuch as we assert that
they who are born of such a union contract that original sin of which the apostle says, “By
one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men,
for in him all sinned;”2060 and because we do not deny, that of whatever kind of parents
they are born, they are still under the devil’s dominion, unless they be born again in Christ,
and by His grace be removed from the power of darkness and translated into His kingdom,
2061 who willed not to be born from the same union of the two sexes. Because, then,
we affirm this doctrine, which is contained in the oldest and unvarying rule of the catholic
faith, these propounders of the novel and perverse dogma, who assert that there is no sin
in infants to be washed away in the laver of regeneration,2062 in their unbelief or ignorance
calumniate us, as if we condemned marriage, and as if we asserted to be the devil’s work
what is God’s own work—the human being which is born of marriage. Nor do they reflect
that the good of marriage is no more impeachable on account of the original evil which is
derived therefrom, than the evil of adultery and fornication is excusable on account of the
natural good which is born of them. For as sin is the work of the devil, from whencesoever
contracted by infants; so man is the work of God, from whencesoever born. Our purpose,
therefore, in this book, so far as the Lord vouchsafes us in His help, is to distinguish between
the evil of carnal concupiscence from which man who is born therefrom contracts original
sin, and the good of marriage. For there would have been none of this shame-producing
concupiscence, which is impudently praised by impudent men, if man had not previously
sinned; while as to marriage, it would still have existed even if no man had sinned, since the
procreation of children in the body that belonged to that life would have been effected
without that malady which in “the body of this death”2063 cannot be separated from the
process of procreation.</p>

<head>Chapter 2. <del>II.</del>—Why This Treatise Was Addressed to Valerius.</head>
<p>Now there are three very special reasons, which I will briefly indicate, why I wished to
write to you particularly on this subject. One is, because by the gift of Christ you are a strict
observer of conjugal chastity. Another is, because by your great care and diligence you have
effectually withstood those profane novelties which we are resisting in our present discussion.
The third is, because of my learning that something which they had committed to writing
had found its way into your hands; and although in your robust faith you could despise such
an attempt, it is still a good thing for us also to know how to bring aid to our faith by defending
it. For the Apostle Peter instructs us to be “ready always to give an answer to every one
that asketh us a reason of the faith and hope that is in us;”2064 and the Apostle Paul says,
“Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought
to answer every man.”2065 These are the motives which chiefly impel me to hold such converse
with you in this volume, as the Lord shall enable me. I have never liked, indeed, to
intrude the perusal of any of my humble labours on any eminent person, who is like yourself
conspicuous to all from the elevation of his office, without his own request,—especially
when he is not blessed with the enjoyment of a dignified retirement, but is still occupied in
the public duties of a soldier’s profession; this has always seemed to me to savour more
impertinence than of respectful esteem. If, then, I have incurred censure of this kind, while
acting on the reasons which I have now mentioned, I crave the favour of your forgiveness,
and kindly regard to the following arguments.</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>III.</del>—Conjugal Chastity the Gift of God.</head>
<p>That chastity in the married state is God’s gift, is shown by the most blessed Paul, when,
speaking on this very subject, he says: “But I would that all men were even as I myself: but
every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.”2066
Observe, he tells us that this gift is from God; and although he classes it below that continence
in which he would have all men to be like himself, he still describes it as a gift of God. Whence
we understand that, when these precepts are given to us in order that we should do them,
nothing else is stated than that there ought to be within us our own will also for receiving
and having them. When, therefore, these are shown to be gifts of God, it is meant that they
must be sought from Him if they are not already possessed; and if they are possessed, thanks
must be given to Him for the possession; moreover, that our own wills have but small avail
for seeking, obtaining, and holding fast these gifts, unless they be assisted by God’s grace.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—A Difficulty as Regards the Chastity of Unbelievers. None But a Believer
is Truly a Chaste Man.2067</head>
<p>What, then, have we to say when conjugal chastity is discovered even in some unbelievers?
Must it be said that they sin, in that they make a bad use of a gift of God, in not restoring
it to the worship of Him from whom they received it? Or must these endowments, perchance,
be not regarded as gifts of God at all, when they are not believers who exercise them; according
to the apostle’s sentiment, when he says, “Whatsoever is not of faith is sin?” 2068 But
who would dare to say that a gift of God is sin? For the soul and the body, and all the natural
endowments which are implanted in the soul and the body, even in the persons of sinful
men, are still gifts of God; for it is God who made them, and not they themselves. When it
is said, “Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,” only those things are meant which men themselves
do. When men, therefore, do without faith those things which seem to appertain to conjugal
chastity, they do them either to please men, whether themselves or others, or to avoid incurring
such troubles as are incidental to human nature in those things which they corruptly
desire, or to pay service to devils. Sins are not really resigned, but some sins are overpowered
by other sins. God forbid, then, that a man be truly called chaste who observes connubial
fidelity to his wife from any other motive than devotion to the true God.</p>

<head>Chapter 5 <del>IV.</del>—The Natural Good of Marriage. All Society Naturally Repudiates
a Fraudulent Companion. What is True Conjugal Purity? No True Virginity and
Chastity Except in Devotion to True Faith.</head>
<p>The union, then, of male and female for the purpose of procreation is the natural good
of marriage. But he makes a bad use of this good who uses it bestially, so that his intention
is on the gratification of lust, instead of the desire of offspring. Nevertheless, in sundry animals
unendowed with reason, as, for instance, in most birds, there is both preserved a certain
kind of confederation of pairs, and a social combination of skill in nest-building; and their
mutual division of the periods for cherishing their eggs and their alternation in the labor of
feeding their young, give them the appearance of so acting, when they mate, as to be intent
rather on securing the continuance of their kind than on gratifying lust. Of these two, the
one is the likeness of man in a brute; the other, the likeness of the brute in man. With respect,
however, to what I ascribed to the nature of marriage, that the male and the female are
united together as associates for procreation, and consequently do not defraud each other
(forasmuch as every associated state has a natural abhorrence of a fraudulent companion),
although even men without faith possess this palpable blessing of nature, yet, since they use
it not in faith, they only turn it to evil and sin. In like manner, therefore, the marriage of
believers converts to the use of righteousness that carnal concupiscence by which “the flesh
lusteth against the Spirit.”2069 For they entertain the firm purpose of generating offspring
to be regenerated—that the children who are born of them as “children of the world” may
be born again and become “sons of God.” Wherefore all parents who do not beget children
with this intention, this will, this purpose, of transferring them from being members of the
first man into being members of Christ, but boast as unbelieving parents over unbelieving
children,—however circumspect they be in their cohabitation, studiously limiting it to the
begetting of children,—really have no conjugal chastity in themselves. For inasmuch as
chastity is a virtue, hating unchastity as its contrary vice, and as all the virtues (even those
whose operation is by means of the body) have their seat in the soul, how can the body be
in any true sense said to be chaste, when the soul itself is committing fornication against
the true God? Now such fornication the holy psalmist censures when he says: “For, lo, they
that are far from Thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from
Thee.”2070 There is, then, no true chastity, whether conjugal, or vidual, or virginal, except
that which devotes itself to true faith. For though consecrated virginity is rightly preferred
to marriage, yet what Christian in his sober mind would not prefer catholic Christian women
who have been even more than once married, to not only vestals, but also to heretical virgins?
So great is the avail of faith, of which the apostle says, “Whatsoever is not of faith is sin;”

<head>Chapter 6 <del>V.</del>—The Censuring of Lust is Not a Condemnation of Marriage; Whence
Comes Shame in the Human Body. Adam and Eve Were Not Created Blind;
Meaning of Their “Eyes Being Opened.”</head>
<p>Now, this being the real state of the question, they undoubtedly err who suppose that,
when fleshly lust is censured, marriage is condemned; as if the malady of concupiscence
was the outcome of marriage and not of sin. Were not those first spouses, whose nuptials
God blessed with the words, “Be fruitful and multiply,”2073 naked, and yet not ashamed?
Why, then, did shame arise out of their members after sin, except because an indecent motion
arose from them, which, if men had not sinned, would certainly never have existed in marriage?
Or was it, forsooth, as some hold (who give little heed to what they read), that human
beings were, like dogs, at first created blind; and—absurder still—obtained sight, not as dogs
do, by growing, but by sinning? Far be it from us to entertain such an opinion. But they
gather that opinion of theirs from reading: “She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and
gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat: and the eyes of them both were opened,
and they knew that they were naked.”2074 This accounts for the opinion of unintelligent
persons, that the eyes of the first man and woman were previously closed, because Holy
Scripture testifies that they were then opened. Well, then, were Hagar’s eyes, the handmaid
of Sarah, previously shut, when, with her thirsty and sobbing child, she opened her eyes2075
and saw the well? Or did those two disciples, after the Lord’s resurrection, walk in the way
with Him with their eyes shut, since the evangelist says of them that “in the breaking of
bread their eyes were opened, and they knew Him”?2076 What, therefore, is written concerning
the first man and woman, that “the eyes of them both were opened,”2077 we ought to
understand as that they gave attention to perceiving and recognising the new state which
had befallen their body. Now that their eyes were opened, their body appeared to them naked,
and they knew it. If this were not the meaning, how, when the beast of the field and the
fowls of the air were brought unto him,2078 could Adam have given them names if his eyes
were shut? He could not have done this without distinguishing them; and he could not distinguish
them without seeing them. How, too, could the woman herself have been beheld
so clearly by him when he said, “This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh”?2079

If, indeed, any one shall be so determined on cavilling as to insist that Adam might have
acquired a discernment of these objects, not by sight but by touch, what explanation will he
have to give of the passage wherein we are told how the woman “saw that the tree,” from
which she was about to pluck the forbidden fruit, “was pleasant for the eyes to behold”?2080
No; “they were both naked, and were not ashamed,”2081 not because they had no eyesight,
but because they perceived no reason to be ashamed in their members, which had all along
been seen by them. For it is not said: They were both naked, and knew it not; but “they were
not ashamed.” Because, indeed, nothing had previously happened which was not lawful, so
nothing had ensued which could cause them shame.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>VI.</del>—Man’s Disobedience Justly Requited in the Rebellion of His Own
Flesh; The Blush of Shame for the Disobedient Members of the Body.</head>
<p>When the first man transgressed the law of God, he began to have another law in his
members which was repugnant to the law of his mind, and he felt the evil of his own disobedience
when he experienced in the disobedience of his flesh a most righteous retribution
recoiling on himself. Such, then, was “the opening of his eyes” which the serpent had
promised him in his temptation2082—the knowledge, in fact, of something which he had
better been ignorant of. Then, indeed, did man perceive within himself what he had done;
then did he distinguish evil from good,—not by avoiding it, but by enduring it. For it certainly
was not just that obedience should be rendered by his servant, that is, his body, to him, who
had not obeyed his own Lord. Well, then, how significant is the fact that the eyes, and lips,
and tongue, and hands, and feet, and the bending of back, and neck, and sides, are all placed
within our power—to be applied to such operations as are suitable to them, when we have
a body free from impediments and in a sound state of health; but when it must come to
man’s great function of the procreation of children the members which were expressly created
for this purpose will not obey the direction of the will, but lust has to be waited for to set
these members in motion, as if it had legal right over them, and sometimes it refuses to act
when the mind wills, while often it acts against its will! Must not this bring the blush of
shame over the freedom of the human will, that by its contempt of God, its own Commander,
it has lost all proper command for itself over its own members? Now, wherein could be
found a more fitting demonstration of the just depravation of human nature by reason of
its disobedience, than in the disobedience of those parts whence nature herself derives subsistence
by succession? For it is by an especial propriety that those parts of the body are
designated as natural. This, then, was the reason why the first human pair, on experiencing
in the flesh that motion which was indecent because disobedient, and on feeling the shame
of their nakedness, covered these offending members with fig-leaves;2083 in order that, at
the very least, by the will of the ashamed offenders, a veil might be thrown over that which
was put into motion without the will of those who wished it: and since shame arose from
what indecently pleased, decency might be attained by concealment.</p>

<head>Chapter 8 <del>VII.</del>—The Evil of Lust Does Not Take Away the Good of Marriage.</head>
<p>Forasmuch, then, as the good of marriage could not be lost by the addition of this evil,
some imprudent persons suppose that this is not an added evil, but something which appertains
to the original good. A distinction, however, occurs not only to subtle reason, but even
to the most ordinary natural judgment, which was both apparent in the case of the first man
and woman, and also holds good still in the case of married persons to-day. What they afterward
effected in propagation,—that is the good of marriage; but what they first veiled
through shame,—that is the evil of concupiscence, which everywhere shuns sight, and in
its shame seeks privacy. Since, therefore, marriage effects some good even out of that evil,
it has whereof to glory; but since the good cannot be effected without the evil, it has reason
for feeling shame. The case may be illustrated by the example of a lame man. Suppose him
to attain to some good object by limping after it, then, on the one hand, the attainment itself
is not evil because of the evil of the man’s lameness; nor, on the other hand, is the lameness
good because of the goodness of the attainment. So, on the same principle, we ought not to
condemn marriage because of the evil of lust; nor must we praise lust because of the good
of marriage.</p>

<head>Chapter 9 <del>VIII.</del>—This Disease of Concupiscence in Marriage is Not to Be a Matter
of Will, But of Necessity; What Ought to Be the Will of Believers in the Use of
Matrimony; Who is to Be Regarded as Using, and Not Succumbing To, the Evil
of Concupiscence; How the Holy Fathers of the Old Testament Formerly Used
Wives.</head>
<p>This disease of concupiscence is what the apostle refers to, when, speaking to married
believers, he says: “This is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain
from fornication: that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification
and honour; not in the disease of desire, even as the Gentiles which know not God.”2084
The married believer, therefore, must not only not use another man’s vessel, which is what
they do who lust after others’ wives; but he must know that even his own vessel is not to be
possessed in the disease of carnal concupiscence. And this counsel is not to be understood
as if the apostle prohibited conjugal—that is to say, lawful and honourable—cohabitation;
but so as that that cohabitation (which would have no adjunct of unwholesome lust, were
it not that man’s perfect freedom of choice had become by preceding sin so disabled that it
has this fatal adjunct) should not be a matter of will, but of necessity, without which, nevertheless,
it would be impossible to attain to the fruition of the will itself in the procreation of
children. And this wish is not in the marriages of believers determined by the purpose of
having such children born as shall pass through life in this present world, but such as shall
be born again in Christ, and remain in Him for evermore. Now if this result should come
about, the reward of a full felicity will spring from marriage; but if such result be not realized,
there will yet ensue to the married pair the peace of their good will. Whosoever possesses
his vessel (that is, his wife) with this intention of heart, certainly does not possess her in the
“disease of desire,” as the Gentiles which know not God, but in sanctification and honour,
as believers who hope in God. A man turns to use the evil of concupiscence, and is not
overcome by it, when he bridles and restrains its rage, as it works in inordinate and indecorous
motions; and never relaxes his hold upon it except when intent on offspring, and then
controls and applies it to the carnal generation of children to be spiritually regenerated, not
to the subjection of the spirit to the flesh in a sordid servitude. That the holy fathers of olden
times after Abraham, and before him, to whom God gave His testimony that “they pleased
Him,” 2085 thus used their wives, no one who is a Christian ought to doubt, since it was
permitted to certain individuals amongst them to have a plurality of wives, where the reason
was for the multiplication of their offspring, not the desire of varying gratification.</p>

Nature Prefers Singleness in Her Dominations.</head>
<p>Now, if to the God of our fathers, who is likewise our God, such a plurality of wives had
not been displeasing for the purpose that lust might have a fuller range of indulgence; then,
on such a supposition, the holy women also ought each to have rendered service to several
husbands. But if any woman had so acted, what feeling but that of a disgraceful concupiscence
could impel her to have more husbands, seeing that by such licence she could not have more
children? That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband
with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very
first union of a married pair, which was made by the Divine Being Himself, with the intention
of marriages taking their beginning therefrom, and of its affording to them a more honourable
precedent. In the advance, however, of the human race, it came to pass that to certain good
men were united a plurality of good wives,—many to each; and from this it would seem that
moderation sought rather unity on one side for dignity, while nature permitted plurality
on the other side for fecundity. For on natural principles it is more feasible for one to have
dominion over many, than for many to have dominion over one. Nor can it be doubted,
that it is more consonant with the order of nature that men should bear rule over women,
than women over men. It is with this principle in view that the apostle says, “The head of
the woman is the man;”2086 and, “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.”2087
So also the Apostle Peter writes: “Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.”2088 Now,
although the fact of the matter is, that while nature loves singleness in her dominations, but
we may see plurality existing more readily in the subordinate portion of our race; yet for all
that, it was at no time lawful for one man to have a plurality of wives, except for the purpose
of a greater number of children springing from him. Wherefore, if one woman cohabits
with several men, inasmuch as no increase of offspring accrues to her therefrom, but only
a more frequent gratification of lust, she cannot possibly be a wife, but only a harlot.</p>

<head>Chapter 11 [X.]—The Sacrament of Marriage; Marriage Indissoluble; The World’s
Law About Divorce Different from the Gospel’s.</head>
<p>It is certainly not fecundity only, the fruit of which consists of offspring, nor chastity
only, whose bond is fidelity, but also a certain sacramental bond2089 in marriage which is
recommended to believers in wedlock. Accordingly it is enjoined by the apostle: “Husbands,
love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church.”2090 Of this bond the substance2091
undoubtedly is this, that the man and the woman who are joined together in matrimony
should remain inseparable as long as they live; and that it should be unlawful for one consort
to be parted from the other, except for the cause of fornication.2092 For this is preserved in
the case of Christ and the Church; so that, as a living one with a living one, there is no divorce,
no separation for ever. And so complete is the observance of this bond in the city of our
God, in His holy mountain2093—that is to say, in the Church of Christ—by all married believers,
who are undoubtedly members of Christ, that, although women marry, and men
take wives, for the purpose of procreating children, it is never permitted one to put away
even an unfruitful wife for the sake of having another to bear children. And whosoever does
this is held to be guilty of adultery by the law of the gospel; though not by this world’s rule,
which allows a divorce between the parties, without even the allegation of guilt, and the
contraction of other nuptial engagements,—a concession which, the Lord tells us, even the
holy Moses extended to the people of Israel, because of the hardness of their hearts.2094 The
same condemnation applies to the woman, if she is married to another man. So enduring,
indeed, are the rights of marriage between those who have contracted them, as long as they
both live, that even they are looked on as man and wife still, who have separated from one
another, rather than they between whom a new connection has been formed. For by this
new connection they would not be guilty of adultery, if the previous matrimonial relation
did not still continue. If the husband die, with whom a true marriage was made, a true
marriage is now possible by a connection which would before have been adultery. Thus
between the conjugal pair, as long as they live, the nuptial bond has a permanent obligation,
and can be cancelled neither by separation nor by union with another. But this permanence
avails, in such cases, only for injury from the sin, not for a bond of the covenant. In like
manner the soul of an apostate, which renounces as it were its marriage union with Christ,
does not, even though it has cast its faith away, lose the sacrament of its faith, which it re-

<p>But God forbid that the nuptial bond should be regarded as broken between those who
have by mutual consent agreed to observe a perpetual abstinence from the use of carnal
concupiscence. Nay, it will be only a firmer one, whereby they have exchanged pledges together,
which will have to be kept by an especial endearment and concord,—not by the voluptuous
links of bodies, but by the voluntary affections of souls. For it was not deceitfully
that the angel said to Joseph: “Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife.”2095 She is called
his wife because of her first troth of betrothal, although he had had no carnal knowledge of
her, nor was destined to have. The designation of wife was neither destroyed nor made untrue,
where there never had been, nor was meant to be, any carnal connection. That virgin wife
was rather a holier and more wonderful joy to her husband because of her very pregnancy
without man, with disparity as to the child that was born, without disparity in the faith they
cherished. And because of this conjugal fidelity they are both deservedly called “parents”2096
of Christ (not only she as His mother, but he as His father, as being her husband), both
having been such in mind and purpose, though not in the flesh. But while the one was His
father in purpose only, and the other His mother in the flesh also, they were both of them,
for all that, only the parents of His humility, not of His sublimity; of His weakness, not of
His divinity. For the Gospel does not lie, in which one reads, “Both His father and His
mother marvelled at those things which were spoken about Him;”2097 and in another passage,
“Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year;”2098 and again a little afterwards, “His
mother said unto Him, Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us? Behold, Thy father and I
have sought Thee sorrowing.”2099 In order, however, that He might show them that He had
a Father besides them, who begat Him without a mother, He said to them in answer: “How
is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?”2100 Furthermore,
lest He should be thought to have repudiated them as His parents by what He had
just said, the evangelist at once added: “And they understood not the saying which He spake

lived? Now, since she bore Him without his engendering, they could not surely have both
been His parents, of that form of a servant, if they had not been conjugally united, though
without carnal connection. Accordingly the genealogical series (although both parents of
Christ are mentioned together in the succession)2104 had to be extended, as it is in fact,2105
down rather to Joseph’s name, that no wrong might be done, in the case of this marriage,

<head>Chapter 13.—In the Marriage of Mary and Joseph There Were All the Blessings of
the Wedded State; All that is Born of Concubinage is Sinful Flesh.</head>
<p>The entire good, therefore, of the nuptial institution was effected in the case of these
parents of Christ: there was offspring, there was faithfulness, there was the bond.2107 As
offspring, we recognise the Lord Jesus Himself; the fidelity, in that there was no adultery;
the bond,2108 because there was no divorce. [XII.] Only there was no nuptial cohabitation;
because He who was to be without sin, and was sent not in sinful flesh, but in the likeness
of sinful flesh,2109 could not possibly have been made in sinful flesh itself without that
shameful lust of the flesh which comes from sin, and without which He willed to be born,
in order that He might teach us, that every one who is born of sexual intercourse is in fact
sinful flesh, since that alone which was not born of such intercourse was not sinful flesh.
Nevertheless conjugal intercourse is not in itself sin, when it is had with the intention of
producing children; because the mind’s good-will leads the ensuing bodily pleasure, instead
of following its lead; and the human choice is not distracted by the yoke of sin pressing upon
it, inasmuch as the blow of the sin is rightly brought back to the purposes of procreation.
This blow has a certain prurient activity which plays the king in the foul indulgences of
adultery, and fornication, and lasciviousness, and uncleanness; whilst in the indispensable
duties of the marriage state, it exhibits the docility of the slave. In the one case it is condemned
as the shameless effrontery of so violent a master; in the other, it gets modest praise as the
honest service of so submissive an attendant. This lust, then, is not in itself the good of the
nuptial institution; but it is obscenity in sinful men, a necessity in procreant parents, the
fire of lascivious indulgences, the shame of nuptial pleasures. Wherefore, then, may not
persons remain man and wife when they cease by mutual consent from cohabitation; seeing
that Joseph and Mary continued such, though they never even began to cohabit?</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—The Teaching of the Apostle on This Subject.</head>
<p>Accordingly the apostle also, speaking apparently with this passage in view, declares:
“But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be
as though they had them not; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and
they that use this world, as though they used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth
away. But I would have you without solicitude.”2111 This entire passage (that I may express
my view on this subject in the shape of a brief exposition of the apostle’s words) I think
must be understood as follows: “This I say, brethren, the time is short.” No longer is God’s
people to be propagated by carnal generation; but, henceforth, it is to be gathered out by
spiritual regeneration. “It remaineth, therefore, that they that have wives” be not subject to
carnal concupiscence; “and they that weep,” under the sadness of present evil, should rejoice
in the hope of future blessing; “and they that rejoice,” over any temporary advantage, should
fear the eternal judgment; “and they that buy,” should so hold their possessions as not to
cleave to them by overmuch love; “and they that use this world” should reflect that it is
passing away, and does not remain. “For the fashion of this world passeth away: but,” he
says, “I would have you to be without solicitude,”—in other words: I would have you lift up
your heart, that it may dwell among those things which do not pass away. He then goes on
to say: “He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he
may please his wife.”2112 And thus to some extent he explains what he had already said:
“Let them that have wives be as though they had none.” For they who have wives in such a
way as to care for the things of the Lord, how they may please the Lord, without having any
care for the things of the world in order to please their wives, are, in fact, just as if they had
no wives. And this is effected with greater ease when the wives, too, are of such a disposition,
because they please their husbands not merely because they are rich, because they are high
in rank, noble in race, and amiable in natural temper, but because they are believers, because
they are religious, because they are chaste, because they are good men.</p>

<p>But in the married, as these things are desirable and praiseworthy, so the others are to
be tolerated, that no lapse occur into damnable sins; that is, into fornications and adulteries.
To escape this evil, even such embraces of husband and wife as have not procreation for
their object, but serve an overbearing concupiscence, are permitted, so far as to be within
range of forgiveness, though not prescribed by way of commandment:2113 and the married
pair are enjoined not to defraud one the other, lest Satan should tempt them by reason of
their incontinence.2114 For thus says the Scripture: “Let the husband render unto the wife
her due:2115 and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her
own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body,
but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other; except it be with consent for a time, that ye may
have leisure for prayer;2116 and then come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your
incontinency. But I speak this by permission,2117 and not of commandment.”2118 Now in
a case where permission2119 must be given, it cannot by any means be contended that there
is not some amount of sin. Since, however, the cohabitation for the purpose of procreating
children, which must be admitted to be the proper end of marriage, is not sinful, what is it
which the apostle allows to be permissible,2120 but that married persons, when they have
not the gift of continence, may require one from the other the due of the flesh—and that
not from a wish for procreation, but for the pleasure of concupiscence? This gratification

<p>It is, however, one thing for married persons to have intercourse only for the wish to
beget children, which is not sinful: it is another thing for them to desire carnal pleasure in
cohabitation, but with the spouse only, which involves venial sin. For although propagation
of offspring is not the motive of the intercourse, there is still no attempt to prevent such
propagation, either by wrong desire or evil appliance. They who resort to these, although
called by the name of spouses, are really not such; they retain no vestige of true matrimony,
but pretend the honourable designation as a cloak for criminal conduct. Having also proceeded
so far, they are betrayed into exposing their children, which are born against their
will. They hate to nourish and retain those whom they were afraid they would beget. This
infliction of cruelty on their offspring so reluctantly begotten, unmasks the sin which they
had practised in darkness, and drags it clearly into the light of day. The open cruelty reproves
the concealed sin. Sometimes, indeed, this lustful cruelty, or, if you please, cruel lust, resorts
to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful
in this, to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth, preferring
that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality; or if it was advancing to life
within the womb, should be slain before it was born. Well, if both parties alike are so flagitious,
they are not husband and wife; and if such were their character from the beginning,
they have not come together by wedlock but by debauchery. But if the two are not alike in
such sin, I boldly declare either that the woman is, so to say, the husband’s harlot; or the
man the wife’s adulterer.</p>

<head>Chapter 18 <del>XVI.</del>—Continence Better Than Marriage; But Marriage Better Than
Fornication.</head>
<p>Forasmuch, then, as marriage cannot be such as that of the primitive men might have
been, if sin had not preceded; it may yet be like that of the holy fathers of the olden time, in
such wise that the carnal concupiscence which causes shame (which did not exist in paradise
previous to the fall, and after that event was not allowed to remain there), although necessarily
forming a part of the body of this death, is not subservient to it, but only submits its
function, when forced thereto, for the sole purpose of assisting in the procreation of children;
otherwise, since the present time (as we have already2122 said) is the period for abstaining
from the nuptial embrace, and therefore makes no necessary demand on the exercise of the
said function, seeing that all nations now contribute so abundantly to the production of an
offspring which shall receive spiritual birth, there is the greater room for the blessing of an
excellent continence. “He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”2123 He, however, who
cannot receive it, “even if he marry, sinneth not;”2124 and if a woman have not the gift of
continence, let her also marry.2125 “It is good, indeed, for a man not to touch a woman.”2126
But since “all men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given,”2127 it remains
that “to avoid fornication, every man ought to have his own wife, and every woman her own
husband.”2128 And thus the weakness of incontinence is hindered from falling into the ruin
of profligacy by the honourable estate of matrimony. Now that which the apostle says of
women, “I will therefore that the younger women marry,”2129 is also applicable to males: I
will that the younger men take wives; that so it may appertain to both sexes alike “to bear
children, to be” fathers and “mothers of families, to give none occasion to the adversary to
speak reproachfully.”2130</p>

<p>In matrimony, however, let these nuptial blessings be the objects of our love—offspring,

it is born to punishment unless it be born again to life. Fidelity, not such as even unbelievers
observe one towards the other, in their ardent love of the flesh. For what husband, however
impious himself, likes an adulterous wife? Or what wife, however impious she be, likes an
adulterous husband? This is indeed a natural good in marriage, though a carnal one. But a
member of Christ ought to be afraid of adultery, not on account of himself, but of his spouse;
and ought to hope to receive from Christ the reward of that fidelity which he shows to his
spouse. The sacramental bond, again, which is lost neither by divorce nor by adultery, should
be guarded by husband and wife with concord and chastity. For it alone is that which even
an unfruitful marriage retains by the law of piety, now that all that hope of fruitfulness is
lost for the purpose of which the couple married. Let these nuptial blessings be praised in
marriage by him who wishes to extol the nuptial institution. Carnal concupiscence, however,
must not be ascribed to marriage: it is only to be tolerated in marriage. It is not a good which
comes out of the essence of marriage, but an evil which is the accident of original sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 20 <del>XVIII</del>—Why Children of Wrath are Born of Holy Matrimony.</head>
<p>This is the reason, indeed, why of even the just and lawful marriages of the children of
God are born, not children of God, but children of the world; because also those who gen-
erate, if they are already regenerate, beget children not as children of God, but as still children
of the world. “The children of this world,” says our Lord, “beget and are begotten.”2132 From
the fact, therefore, that we are still children of this world, our outer man is in a state of corruption;
and on this account our offspring are born as children of the present world; nor
do they become sons of God, except they be regenerated.2133 Yet inasmuch as we are children
of God, our inner man is renewed from day to day.2134 And yet even our outer man has
been sanctified through the laver of regeneration, and has received the hope of future incorruption,
on which account it is justly designated as “the temple of God.” “Your bodies,” says
the apostle, “are the temples of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, and which ye have of God;
and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a great price: therefore glorify and carry
God in your body.”2135 The whole of this statement is made in reference to our present
sanctification, but especially in consequence of that hope of which he says in another passage,
“We ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.”2136 If, then, the
redemption of our body is expected, as the apostle declares, it follows, that being an expectation,
it is as yet a matter of hope, and not of actual possession. Accordingly the apostle
adds: “For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth,
why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait
for it.”2137 Not, therefore, by that which we are waiting for, but by that which we are now
enduring, are the children of our flesh born. God forbid that a man who possesses faith
should, when he hears the apostle bid men “love their wives,”2138 love that carnal concupiscence
in his wife which he ought not to love even in himself; as he may know, if he listens
to the words of another apostle: “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world,
the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is

<head>Chapter 21 <del>XIX.</del>—Thus Sinners are Born of Righteous Parents, Even as Wild Olives
Spring from the Olive.</head>
<p>That, therefore, which is born of the lust of the flesh is really born of the world, and not
of God; but it is born of God, when it is born again of water and of the Spirit. The guilt of
this concupiscence, regeneration alone remits, even as natural generation contracts it. What,
then, is generated must be regenerated, in order that likewise since it cannot be otherwise,
what has been contracted may be remitted. It is, no doubt, very wonderful that what has
been remitted in the parent should still be contracted in the offspring; but nevertheless such
is the case. That this mysterious verity, which unbelievers neither see nor believe, might get
some palpable evidence in its support, God in His providence has secured in the example
of certain trees. For why should we not suppose that for this very purpose the wild olive
springs from the olive? Is it not indeed credible that, in a thing which has been created for
the use of mankind, the Creator provided and appointed what should afford an instructive
example, applicable to the human race? It is a wonderful thing, then, how those who have
been themselves delivered by grace from the bondage of sin, should still beget those who
are tied and bound by the self-same chain, and who require the same process of loosening?
Yes; and we admit the wonderful fact. But that the embryo of wild olive trees should latently
exist in the germs of true olives, who would deem credible, if it were not proved true by experiment
and observation? In the same manner, therefore, as a wild olive grows out of the
seed of the wild olive, and from the seed of the true olive springs also nothing but a wild
olive, notwithstanding the very great difference there is between the wild olive and the olive;
so what is born in the flesh, either of a sinner or of a just man, is in both instances a sinner,
notwithstanding the vast distinction which exists between the sinner and the righteous man.
He that is begotten is no sinner as yet in act, and is still new from his birth; but in guilt he
is old. Human from the Creator, he is a captive of the destroyer, and needs a redeemer. The
difficulty, however, is how a state of captivity can possibly befall the offspring, when the
parents have been themselves previously redeemed from it. Now it is no easy matter to unravel
this intricate point, or to explain it in a set discourse; therefore unbelievers refuse to
accept it as true; just as if in that other point about the wild olive and the olive, which we
gave in illustration, any reason could be easily found, or explanation clearly given, why the
self-same shoot should sprout out of so dissimilar a stock. The truth, however, of this can
be discovered by any one who is willing to make the experiment. Let it then serve for a good
example for suggesting belief of what admits not of ocular demonstration.</p>

<head>Chapter 22 <del>XX.</del>—Even Infants, When Unbaptized, are in the Power of the Devil;
Exorcism in the Case of Infants, and Renunciation of the Devil.</head>
<p>Now the Christian faith unfalteringly declares, what our new heretics have begun to
deny, both that they who are cleansed in the laver of regeneration are redeemed from the
power of the devil, and that those who have not yet been redeemed by such regeneration
are still captive in the power of the devil, even if they be infant children of the redeemed,
unless they be themselves redeemed by the self-same grace of Christ. For we cannot doubt
that that blessing of God applies to every stage of human life, which the apostle describes
when he says concerning Him: “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and
hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.”2140 From this power of darkness,
therefore, of which the devil is the prince,—in other words, from the power of the devil and
his angels,—infants are delivered when they are baptized; and whosoever denies this, is
convicted by the truth of the Church’s very sacraments, which no heretical novelty in the
Church of Christ is permitted to destroy or change, so long as the Divine Head rules and
helps the entire body which He owns—small as well as great. It is true, then, and in no way
false, that the devil’s power is exorcised in infants, and that they renounce him by the hearts
and mouths of those who bring them to baptism, being unable to do so by their own; in
order that they may be delivered from the power of darkness, and be translated into the
kingdom of their Lord. What is that, therefore, within them which keeps them in the power
of the devil until they are delivered from it by Christ’s sacrament of baptism? What is it, I
ask, but sin? Nothing else, indeed, has the devil found which enables him to put under his
own control that nature of man which the good Creator made good. But infants have committed
no sin of their own since they have been alive. Only original sin, therefore, remains,
whereby they are made captive under the devil’s power, until they are redeemed therefrom
by the laver of regeneration and the blood of Christ, and pass into their Redeemer’s kingdom,—
the power of their enthraller being frustrated, and power being given them to become
“sons of God” instead of children of this world.2141</p>

of Matrimony a Great One in the Case of Christ and the Church—A
Very Small One in the Case of a Man and His Wife.</head>
<p>If now we interrogate, so to speak, those goods of marriage to which we have often referred,
2142 and inquire how it is that sin could possibly have been propagated from them
to infants, we shall get this answer from the first of them—the work of procreation of offspring:
“My happiness would in paradise have been greater if sin had not been committed.
For to me belongs that blessing of almighty God: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply.’2143 For accomplishing
this good work, divers members were created suited to each sex; these members
were, of course, in existence before sin, but they were not objects of shame.” This will be
the answer of the second good—the fidelity of chastity: “If sin had not been committed,
what in paradise could have been more secure than myself, when there was no lust of my
own to spur me, none of another to tempt me?” And then this will be the answer of the
sacramental bond of marriage,—the third good: “Of me was that word spoken in paradise
before the entrance of sin: ‘A man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave
unto his wife; and they two shall become one flesh.’”2144 This the apostle applies to the case
of Christ and of the Church, and calls it then “a great sacrament.”2145 What, then, in Christ
and in the Church is great, in the instances of each married pair it is but very small, but even
then it is the sacrament of an inseparable union. What now is there in these three blessings
of marriage out of which the bond of sin could pass over to posterity? Absolutely nothing.
And in these blessings it is certain that the goodness of matrimony is entirely comprised;
and even now good wedlock consists of these same blessings.</p>

<p>But if, in like manner, the question be asked of the concupiscence of the flesh, how it is
that acts now bring shame which once were free from shame, will not her answer be, that
she only began to have existence in men’s members after sin? [XXII.] And, therefore, that
the apostle designated her influence as “the law of sin,”2146 inasmuch as she subjugated man
to herself when he was unwilling to remain subject to his God; and that it was she who made
the first married pair ashamed at that moment when they covered their loins; even as all are
still ashamed, and seek out secret retreats for cohabitation, and dare not have even the
children, whom they have themselves thus begotten, to be witnesses of what they do. It was
against this modesty of natural shame that the Cynic philosophers, in the error of their astonishing
shamelessness, struggled so hard: they thought that the intercourse indeed of
husband and wife, since it was lawful and honourable, should therefore be done in public.
Such barefaced obscenity deserved to receive the name of dogs; and so they went by the title
of “Cynics.”2147</p>

<head>Chapter 25 <del>XXIII.</del>—Concupiscence in the Regenerate Without Consent is Not
Sin; In What Sense Concupiscence is Called Sin.</head>
<p>Now this concupiscence, this law of sin which dwells in our members, to which the law
of righteousness forbids allegiance, saying in the words of the apostle, “Let not sin, therefore,
reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof; neither yield ye your
members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin:”2148—this concupiscence, I say, which
is cleansed only by the sacrament of regeneration, does undoubtedly, by means of natural
birth, pass on the bond of sin to a man’s posterity, unless they are themselves loosed from
it by regeneration. In the case, however, of the regenerate, concupiscence is not itself sin
any longer, whenever they do not consent to it for illicit works, and when the members are
not applied by the presiding mind to perpetrate such deeds. So that, if what is enjoined in
one passage, “Thou shalt not covet,”2149 is not kept, that at any rate is observed which is
commanded in another place, “Thou shalt not go after thy concupiscences.”2150 Inasmuch,
however, as by a certain manner of speech it is called sin, since it arose from sin, and, when
it has the upper hand, produces sin, the guilt of it prevails in the natural man; but this guilt,
by Christ’s grace through the remission of all sins, is not suffered to prevail in the regenerate
man, if he does not yield obedience to it whenever it urges him to the commission of evil.
As arising from sin, it is, I say, called sin, although in the regenerate it is not actually sin;
and it has this designation applied to it, just as speech which the tongue produces is itself
called “tongue;” and just as the word “hand” is used in the sense of writing, which the hand
produces. In the same way concupiscence is called sin, as producing sin when it conquers
the will: so to cold and frost the epithet “sluggish” is given; not as arising from, but as productive
of, sluggishness; benumbing us, in fact.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—Whatever is Born Through Concupiscence is Not Undeservedly in
Subjection to the Devil by Reason of Sin; The Devil Deserves Heavier Punishment
Than Men.</head>
<p>This wound which the devil has inflicted on the human race compels everything which
has its birth in consequence of it to be under the devil’s power, as if he were rightly plucking
fruit off his own tree. Not as if man’s nature, which is only of God, came from him, but sin
alone, which is not of God. For it is not on its own account that man’s nature is under condemnation,
because it is the work of God, and therefore laudable; but on account of that
condemnable corruption by which it has been vitiated. Now it is by reason of this condemnation
that it is in subjection to the devil, who is also in the same damnable state. For the
devil is himself an unclean spirit: good, indeed, so far as he is a spirit, but evil as being unclean;
for by nature he is a spirit, by the corruption thereof an unclean one. Of these two,
the one is of God, the other of himself. His hold over men, therefore, whether of an advanced
age or in infancy, is not because they are human, but because they are polluted. He, then,
who feels surprise that God’s creature is a subject of the devil, should cease from such feeling.
For one creature of God is in subjection to another creature of God, the less to the greater,
a human being to an angelic one; and this is not owing to nature, but to a corruption of
nature: polluted is the sovereign, polluted also the subject. All this is the fruit of that ancient
stock of pollution which he has planted in man; himself being destined to suffer a heavier
punishment at the last judgment, as being the more polluted; but at the same time even they
who will have to bear a less heavy burden in that condemnation are subjects of him as the
prince and author of sin, for there will be no other cause of condemnation than sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 27 <del>XXIV.</del>—Through Lust Original Sin is Transmitted; Venial Sins in
Married Persons; Concupiscence of the Flesh, the Daughter and Mother of Sin.</head>
<p>Wherefore the devil holds infants guilty who are born, not of the good by which marriage
is good, but of the evil of concupiscence, which, indeed, marriage uses aright, but at which
even marriage has occasion to feel shame. Marriage is itself “honourable in all”2151 the goods
which properly appertain to it; but even when it has its “bed undefiled” (not only by fornication
and adultery, which are damnable disgraces, but also by any of those excesses of cohabitation
such as do not arise from any prevailing desire of children, but from an overbearing
lust of pleasure, which are venial sins in man and wife), yet, whenever it comes to the
actual process of generation, the very embrace which is lawful and honourable cannot be
effected without the ardour of lust, so as to be able to accomplish that which appertains to
the use of reason and not of lust. Now, this ardour, whether following or preceding the will,
does somehow, by a power of its own, move the members which cannot be moved simply
by the will, and in this manner it shows itself not to be the servant of a will which commands
it, but rather to be the punishment of a will which disobeys it. It shows, moreover, that it
must be excited, not by a free choice, but by a certain seductive stimulus, and that on this
very account it produces shame. This is the carnal concupiscence, which, while it is no longer
accounted sin in the regenerate, yet in no case happens to nature except from sin. It is the
daughter of sin, as it were; and whenever it yields assent to the commission of shameful
deeds, it becomes also the mother of many sins. Now from this concupiscence whatever
comes into being by natural birth is bound by original sin, unless, indeed, it be born again
in Him whom the Virgin conceived without this concupiscence. Wherefore, when He
vouchsafed to be born in the flesh, He alone was born without sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 28 <del>XXV.</del>—Concupiscence Remains After Baptism, Just as Languor Does
After Recovery from Disease; Concupiscence is Diminished in Persons of Advancing
Years, and Increased in the Incontinent.</head>
<p>If the question arises, how this concupiscence of the flesh remains in the regenerate, in
whose case has been effected a remission of all sins whatever; seeing that human semination
takes place by its means, even when the carnal offspring of even a baptized parent is born:
or, at all events, if it may be in the case of a baptized parent concupiscence and not be sin,
why should this same concupiscence be sin in the offspring?—the answer to be given is this:
Carnal concupiscence is remitted, indeed, in baptism; not so that it is put out of existence,
but so that it is not to be imputed for sin. Although its guilt is now taken away, it still remains
until our entire infirmity be healed by the advancing renewal of our inner man, day by day,
when at last our outward man shall be clothed with incorruption.2152 It does not remain,
however, substantially, as a body, or a spirit; but it is nothing more than a certain affection
of an evil quality, such as languor, for instance. There is not, to be sure, anything remaining
which may be remitted whenever, as the Scripture says, “the Lord forgiveth all our iniquities.”
2153 But until that happens which immediately follows in the same passage, “Who
healeth all thine infirmities, who redeemeth thy life from corruption,”2154 there remains
this concupiscence of the flesh in the body of this death. Now we are admonished not to
obey its sinful desires to do evil: “Let not sin reign in your mortal body.”2155 Still this concupiscence
is daily lessened in persons of continence and increasing years, and most of all
when old age makes a near approach. The man, however, who yields to it a wicked service,
receives such great energies that, even when all his members are now failing through age,
and those especial parts of his body are unable to be applied to their proper function, he
does not ever cease to revel in a still increasing rage of disgraceful and shameless desire.</p>

<head>Chapter 29 <del>XXVI.</del>—How Concupiscence Remains in the Baptized in Act, When
It Has Passed Away as to Its Guilt.</head>
<p>In the case, then, of those persons who are born again in Christ, when they receive an
entire remission of all their sins, it is of course necessary that the guilt also of the still indwelling
concupiscence should be remitted, in order that (as I said) it should not be imputed to
them for sin. For even as in the case of those sins which cannot be themselves permanent,
since they pass away as soon as they are committed, the guilt yet is permanent, and (if not
remitted) will remain for evermore; so, when the concupiscence is remitted, the guilt of it
also is taken away. For not to have sin means this, not to be deemed guilty of sin. If a man
have (for example) committed adultery, though he do not repeat the sin, he is held to be
guilty of adultery until the indulgence in guilt be itself remitted. He has the sin, therefore,
remaining, although the particular act of his sin no longer exists, since it has passed away
along with the time when it was committed. For if to desist from sinning were the same
thing as not to have sins, it would be sufficient if Scripture were content to give us the simple
warning, “My son, hast thou sinned? Do so no more.”2156 This, however, does not suffice,
for it goes on to say, “Ask forgiveness for thy former sins.”2157 Sins remain, therefore, if
they are not forgiven. But how do they remain if they are passed away? Only thus, they have
passed away in their act, but they are permanent in their guilt. Contrariwise, then, may it
happen that a thing may remain in act, but pass away in guilt.</p>

<head>Chapter 30 <del>XXVII.</del>—The Evil Desires of Concupiscence; We Ought to Wish that
They May Not Be.</head>
<p>For the concupiscence of the flesh is in some sort active, even when it does not exhibit
either an assent of the heart, where its seat of empire is, or those members whereby, as its
weapons, it fulfils what it is bent on. But what in this action does it effect, unless it be its evil
and shameful desires? For if these were good and lawful, the apostle would not forbid
obedience to them, saying, “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
obey the lusts thereof.”2158 He does not say, that ye should have the lusts thereof, but “that
ye should obey the lusts thereof;” in order that (as these desires are greater or less in different
individuals, according as each shall have progressed in the renewal of the inner man) we
may maintain the fight of holiness and chastity, for the purpose of withholding obedience
to these lusts. Nevertheless, our wish ought to be nothing less than the nonexistence of these
very desires, even if the accomplishment of such a wish be not possible in the body of this
death. This is the reason why the same apostle, in another passage, addressing us as if in his
own person, gives us this instruction: “For what I would,” says he, “that do I not; but what
I hate, that do I.”2159 In a word, “I covet.”2160 For he was unwilling to do this, that he might
be perfect on every side. “If, then, I do that which I would not,” he goes on to say, “I consent
unto the law that it is good.”2161 Because the law, too, wills not that which I also would not.
For it wills not that I should have concupiscence, for it says, “Thou shall not covet;”2162 and
I am no less unwilling to cherish so evil a desire. In this, therefore, there is complete accord
between the will of the law and my own will. But because he was unwilling to covet,2163 and
yet did covet,2164 and for all that did not by any means obey this concupiscence so as to
yield assent to it, he immediately adds these words: “Now, then, it is no more I that do it,
but sin that dwelleth in me.”2165</p>

<p>A man, however, is much deceived if, while consenting to the lust of his flesh, and then
both resolving in his mind to do its desires and setting about it, he supposes that he has still
a right to say, “It is not I that do it,” even if he hates and loathes himself for assenting to evil
desires. The two things are simultaneous in his case: he hates the thing himself because he
knows that it is evil; and yet he does it, because he is bent on doing it. Now if, in addition
to all this, he proceeds to do what the Scripture forbids him, when it says, “Neither yield ye
your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,”2166 and completes with a bodily
act what he was bent on doing in his mind; and says, “It is not I that do the thing, but sin
that dwelleth in me,”2167 because he feels displeased with himself for resolving on and accomplishing
the deed,—he so greatly errs as not to know his own self. For, whereas he is
altogether himself, his mind determining and his body executing his own purpose, he yet
supposes that he is himself no longer! <del>XXIX.</del> That man, therefore, alone speaks the truth
when he says, “It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me,” who only feels the
concupiscence, and neither resolves on doing it with the consent of his heart, nor accomplishes
it with the ministry of his body.</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—When Good Will Be Perfectly Done.</head>
<p>The apostle then adds these words: “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth
no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perfect that which is good I find
not.”2168 Now this is said, because a good thing is not then perfected, when there is an absence
of evil desires, as evil is perfected when evil desires are obeyed. But when they are present,
but are not obeyed, neither evil is performed, since obedience is not yielded to them; nor
good, because of their inoperative presence. There is rather an intermediate condition of
things: good is effected in some degree, because the evil concupiscence has gained no assent
to itself; and in some degree there is a remnant of evil, because the concupiscence is present.
This accounts for the apostle’s precise words. He does not say, To do good is not present to
him, but “how to perfect it.” For the truth is, one does a good deal of good when he does
what the Scripture enjoins, “Go not after thy lusts;”2169 yet he falls short of perfection, in
that he fails to keep the great commandment, “Thou shalt not covet.”2170 The law said,
“Thou shalt not covet,” in order that, when we find ourselves lying in this diseased state, we
might seek the medicine of Grace, and by that commandment know both in what direction
our endeavours should aim as we advance in our present mortal condition, and to what a
height it is possible to reach in the future immortality. For unless perfection could somewhere
be attained, this commandment would never have been given to us.</p>

<head>Chapter 33 <del>XXX.</del>—True Freedom Comes with Willing Delight in God’s Law.</head>
<p>The apostle then repeats his former statement, the more fully to recommend its purport:
“For the good,” says he, “that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.” Then
follows this: “I find then the law, when I would act, to be good to me; for evil is present with
me.”2171 In other words, I find that the law is a good to me, when I wish to do what the law
would have me do; inasmuch as it is not with the law itself (which says, “Thou shalt not
covet”) that evil is present; no, it is with myself that the evil is present, which I would not
do, because I have the concupiscence even in my willingness. “For,” he adds, “I delight in
the law of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members warring against
the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.”
2172 This delight with the law of God2173 after the inward man, comes to us from the
mighty grace of God; for thereby is our inward man renewed day by day,2174 because it is
thereby that progress is made by us with perseverance. In it there is not the fear that has
torment, but the love that cheers and gratifies. We are truly free there, where we have no
unwilling joy.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—How Concupiscence Made a Captive of the Apostle; What the Law of
Sin Was to the Apostle.</head>
<p>Then, indeed, this statement, “I see another law in my members warring against the law
of my mind,” refers to that very concupiscence which we are now speaking of—the law of
sin in our sinful flesh. But when he said, “And bringing me into captivity to the law of sin,”
that is, to its own self, “which is in my members,” he either meant “bringing me into captivity,”
in the sense of endeavouring to make me captive, that is, urging me to approve and accomplish
evil desire; or rather (and this opens no controversy), in the sense of leading me
captive according to the flesh, and, if this is not possessed by the carnal concupiscence which
he calls the law of sin, no unlawful desire—such as our mind ought not to obey—would, of
course, be there to excite and disturb. The fact, however, that the apostle does not say,
Bringing my flesh into captivity, but “Bringing me into captivity,” leads us to look out for
some other meaning for the phrase, and to understand the term “bringing me into captivity”
as if he had said, endeavouring to make me captive. But why, after all, might he not say,
“Bringing me into captivity,” and at the same time mean us to understand his flesh? Was it
not spoken by one concerning Jesus, when His flesh was not found in the sepulchre: “They
have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him”?2175 Was Mary’s then
an improper question, because she said, “My Lord,” and not “My Lord’s body” or “flesh”?</p>

<head>Chapter 35 <del>XXXI.</del>—The Flesh, Carnal Affection.</head>
<p>But we have in the apostle’s own language, a little before, a sufficiently clear proof that
he might have meant his flesh when he said, “Bringing me into captivity.” For after declaring,
“I know that in me dwelleth no good thing,” he at once added an explanatory sentence to
this effect, “That is,in my flesh.”2176 It is then the flesh, in which there dwells nothing good,
that is brought into captivity to the law of sin. Now he designates that as the flesh wherein
lies a certain morbid carnal affection, not the mere conformation of our bodily fabric whose
members are not to be used as weapons for sin—that is, for that very concupiscence which
holds this flesh of ours captive. So far, indeed, as concerns this actual bodily substance and
nature of ours, it is already God’s temple in all faithful men, whether living in marriage or
in continence. If, however, absolutely nothing of our flesh were in captivity, not even to the
devil, because there has accrued to it the remission of sin, that sin be not imputed to it (and
this is properly designated the law of sin); yet if under this law of sin, that is, under its own
concupiscence, our flesh were not to some degree held captive, how could that be true which
the apostle states, when he speaks of our “waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption
of our body”?2177 In so far, then, as there is now this waiting for the redemption of our
body, there is also in some degree still existing something in us which is a captive to the law
of sin. Accordingly he exclaims, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”2178 What are we to
understand by such language, but that our body, which is undergoing corruption, weighs
heavily on our soul? When, therefore, this very body of ours shall be restored to us in an
incorrupt state, there shall be a full liberation from the body of this death; but there will be
no such deliverance for them who shall rise again to condemnation. To the body of this
death then is understood to be owing the circumstance that there is in our members another
law which wars against the law of the mind, so long as the flesh lusts against the spirit—
without, however, subjugating the mind, inasmuch as on its side, too, the spirit has a
concupiscence contrary to the flesh.2179 Thus, although the actual law of sin partly holds
the flesh in captivity (whence comes its resistance to the law of the mind), still it has not an
absolute empire in our body, notwithstanding its mortal state, since it refuses obedience to
its desires.2180 For in the case of hostile armies between whom there is an earnest conflict,
even the side which is inferior in the fight usually holds a something which it has captured;
and although in some such way there is somewhat in our flesh which is kept under the law

<head>Chapter 36.—Even Now While We Still Have Concupiscence We May Be Safe in

<p>But the apostle pursues the subject, and says, “So then with the mind I myself serve the
law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin;”2181 which must be thus understood: “With
my mind I serve the law of God,” by refusing my consent to the law of sin; “with my flesh,
however,” I serve “the law of sin,” by having the desires of sin, from which I am not yet entirely
freed, although I yield them no assent. Then let us observe carefully what he has said
after all the above: “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Jesus.”2182 Even now, says he, when the law in my members keeps up its warfare against
the law of my mind, and retains in captivity somewhat in the body of this death, there is no
condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. And listen why: “For the law of the spirit
of life in Christ Jesus,” says he, “hath made me free from the law of sin and death.”2183 How
made me free, except by abolishing its sentence of guilt by the remission of all my sins; so
that, though it still remains, only daily lessening more and more, it is nevertheless not imputed
to me as sin?</p>

<head>Chapter 37 <del>XXXII.</del>—The Law of Sin with Its Guilt in Unbaptized Infants. By
Adam’s Sin the Human Race Has Become a “Wild Olive Tree.”</head>
<p>Until, then, this remission of sins takes place in the offspring, they have within them
the law of sin in such manner, that it is really imputed to them as sin; in other words, with
that law there is attaching to them its sentence of guilt, which holds them debtors to eternal
condemnation. For what a parent transmits to his carnal offspring is the condition of his
own carnal birth, not that of his spiritual new birth. For, that he was born in the flesh, although
no hindrance after the remission of his guilt to his fruit, still remains hidden, as it
were, in the seed of the olive, even though, because of the remission of his sins, it in no respect
injures the oil—that is, in plain language, his life which he lives, “righteous by faith,”2184
after Christ, whose very name comes from the oil, that is, from the anointing.2185 That,
however, which in the case of a regenerate parent, as in the seed of the pure olive, is covered
without any guilt, which has been remitted, is still no doubt retained in the case of his offspring,
which is yet unregenerate, as in the wild olive, with all its guilt, until here also it be
remitted by the self-same grace. When Adam sinned, he was changed from that pure olive,
which had no such corrupt seed whence should spring the bitter issue of the wild olive, into
a wild olive tree; and, inasmuch as his sin was so great, that by it his nature became commensurately
changed for the worse, he converted the entire race of man into a wild olive stock.
The effect of this change we see illustrated, as has been said above, in the instance of these
very trees. Whenever God’s grace converts a sapling into a good olive, so that the fault of
the first birth (that original sin which had been derived and contracted from the concupiscence
of the flesh) is remitted, covered, and not imputed, there is still inherent in it that
nature from which is born a wild olive, unless it, too, by the same grace, is by the second
birth changed into a good olive.</p>

<p>Blessed, therefore, is the olive tree “whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are
covered;” blessed is it “to which the Lord hath not imputed sin.”2186 But this, which has
received the remission, the covering, and the acquittal, even up to the complete change into
an eternal immortality, still retains a secret force which furnishes seed for a wild and bitter
olive tree, unless the same tillage of God prunes it also, by remission, covering, and acquittal.
There will, however, be left no corruption at all in even carnal seed, when the same regener-
ation, which is now effected through the sacred laver, purges and heals all man’s evil to the
very end. By its means the very same flesh, through which the carnal mind was formed, shall
become spiritual,—no longer having that carnal lust which resists the law of the mind, no
longer emitting carnal seed. For in this sense must be understood that which the apostle
whom we have so often quoted says elsewhere: “Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself
for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water by the word; that He
might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing.”2187 It must, I say, be understood as implying, that by this laver of regeneration and
word of sanctification all the evils of regenerate men of whatever kind are cleansed and
healed,—not the sins only which are all now remitted in baptism, but those also which after
baptism are committed by human ignorance and frailty; not, indeed, that baptism is to be
repeated as often as sin is repeated, but that by its one only ministration it comes to pass
that pardon is secured to the faithful of all their sins both before and after their regeneration.
For of what use would repentance be, either before baptism, if baptism did not follow; or
after it, if it did not precede? Nay, in the Lord’s Prayer itself, which is our daily cleansing,
of what avail or advantage would it be for that petition to be uttered, “Forgive us our
debts,”2188 unless it be by such as have been baptized? And in like manner, how great soever
be the liberality and kindness of a man’s alms, what, I ask, would they profit him towards
the remission of his sins if he had not been baptized? In short, on whom but on the baptized
shall be bestowed the very felicities of the kingdom of heaven; where the Church shall have
no spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; where there shall be nothing blameworthy, nothing
unreal; where there shall be not only no guilt for sin, but no concupiscence to excite it?</p>

Church even now, and yet they are in it. Well then, since they confess that they have some

from sins), then the Church has “a spot” in them; whilst if they tell an untruth in their confession
(as speaking from a double heart), then the Church has in them “a wrinkle.” If,
however, they assert that it is themselves, and not the Church, which has all this, they then

<head>Chapter 40 <del>XXXV.</del>—Refutation of the Pelagians by the Authority of St. Ambrose,
Whom They Quote to Show that the Desire of the Flesh is a Natural Good.</head>
<p>In respect, however, to this concupiscence of the flesh, we have striven in this lengthy
discussion to distinguish it accurately from the goods of marriage. This we have done on
account of our modern heretics, who cavil whenever concupiscence is censured, as if it involved
a censure of marriage. Their object is to praise concupiscence as a natural good, that
so they may defend their own baneful dogma, which asserts that those who are born by its
means do not contract original sin. Now the blessed Ambrose, bishop of Milan, by whose
priestly office I received the washing of regeneration, briefly spoke on this matter, when,
expounding the prophet Isaiah, he gathered from him the nativity of Christ in the flesh:
“Thus,” says the bishop, “He was both tempted in all points as a man,2189 and in the likeness
of man He bare all things; but inasmuch as He was born of the Spirit, He kept Himself from
sin. For every man is a liar; and there is none without sin but God alone. It has, therefore,
been ever firmly maintained, that it is clear that no man from husband and wife, that is to
say, by means of that conjunction of their persons, is free from sin. He who is free from sin
is also free from conception of this kind.” Well now, what is it which St. Ambrose has here
condemned in the true doctrine of this deliverance?—is it the goodness of marriage, or not
rather the worthless opinion of these heretics, although they had not then come upon the
stage? I have thought it worth while to adduce this testimony, because Pelagius mentions
Ambrose with such commendation as to say: “The blessed Bishop Ambrose, in whose
writings more than anywhere else the Roman faith is clearly stated, has flourished like a
beautiful flower among the Latin writers. His fidelity and extremely pure perception of the
sense of Scripture no opponent even has ever ventured to impugn.”2190 I hope he may regret
having entertained opinions opposed to Ambrose, but not that he has bestowed this praise
on that holy man.</p>
<p>Here, then, you have my book, which, owing to its tedious length and difficult subject,
it has been as troublesome for me to compose as for you to read, in those little snatches of
time in which you have been able (or at least, as I suppose, have been able) to find yourself
at leisure. Although it has been indeed drawn up with considerable labour amidst my ecclesiastical

it on your notice, with all your public cares, if I had not been informed by a godly man, who

<head>PRELIMINARY NOTES ON THE SECOND BOOK.</head>
<p>(1) From the Preface of Augustin’s “Unfinished Work Against Julianus.”</p>
<p>I Wrote a treatise, under the title On Marriage and Concupiscence, and addressed it to
the Count Valerius, on learning that he had been informed of the Pelagians that they charge
us with condemning marriage. Now in that treatise I showed the distinction, as criticially
and accurately as I was able, between the good of marriage and the evil of carnal concupiscence,—
an evil which is well used by conjugal chastity. On receiving my treatise, the illustrious
man whom I have named sent me in a short paper2191 a few sentences culled from a
work of Julianus,2192 a Pelagian heretic. In this work he has thought fit to extend to four
books his answer to the before-mentioned treatise of mine, which is limited to one book
only, On Marriage and Concupiscence. I do not know to whom we were indebted for the
said extracts: he confined his selection, evidently on purpose, to the first book of Julianus’
work. At the request of Valerius, I lost no time in drawing up my answer to the extracts.
And thus it happened that I have written a second book also under the same title; and in
reply to this Julianus has drawn up to eight books, in excess of his loquacious powers.</p>

<note type="footnote">2191 In chartula.</note>
<note type="footnote">2192 [This able and learned man was much the most formidable of the Pelagian writers. Besides this book,
Augustin wrote three large works against him, the treatise Against Two Letters of the Pelagians, and the two
treatises Against Julian the last of which is usually called The Unfinished Work from the circumstance that Augustin
left it incomplete at his death. Julian was a son of a dear friend of Augustin, and was himself much loved
by him. He became a “lector” in 404, and was ordained bishop by Innocent I. about 417. Under Zosimus’ vacillating
policy he took strong ground on the Pelagian side, and, refusing to sign Zosimus’ Tractoria, was exiled
with his seventeen fellow-recusants, and passed his long life in vain endeavours to obtain recognition for the
Pelagian party. His writings included two letters to Zosimus, a Confession of Faith, the two letters answered in
Against Two Letters of the Pelagians (though he seems to have repudiated the former of these), and two large
books against Augustin, the first of which was his four books against the first book of the present treatise, against
extracts from which the second book was written, whilst Augustin’s Against Julian, in six books, traverses the
whole work. To this second book Julian replied in a rejoinder addressed to Florus, and consisting of eight books.
Augustin’s Unfinished Work is a reply to this. Julian’s character was as noble as his energy was great and his pen
acute. He stands out among his fellow-Pelagians as the sufferer for conscience’ sake. A full account of his works
may be read in the Preface to Augustin’s Unfinished Work, with which may be compared the article on him in
Smith and Wace’s Dictionary of Christian Biography—W.]</note>

<p>“Whoever has perused this second book of mine, addressed (as the first was) to the
Count Valerius, and drawn up (as, indeed, both were) for his use, will have discovered that
there are some points in which I have not answered Julianus, but that I meant my work
rather for him who made the extracts from that writer’s books, and who did not arrange
them in the order in which he found them. He deemed some considerable alteration necessary
in his arrangement, very probably with the view of appropriating by this method as his own
the thoughts which evidently were another person’s.”</p>

author from the first of four books that Julianus had published in opposition to the former
book of his treatise “On Marriage and Concupiscence;” which sentences had been forwarded
to him at the instance of the Count Valerius. He vindicates the Catholic doctrine of original
sin from his opponent’s cavils and subtleties, and particularly shows how diverse it
is from the infamous heresy of the Manicheans.</p>

which devolve on you in the eminent position you so justly occupy, and the pressing functions,
moreover, of your political life. After reading the letter of your Eminence, in which
you acknowledge the book which I dedicated to you, I was roused to write this also; for you
request me to attend to the statement, which my brother and fellow-bishop Alypius is
commissioned to make to me, about the discussion which is being raised by the heretics
over sundry passages of my book. Not only have I received this information from the narrative
of my said brother, but I have also read the extracts which he produced, and which
you had yourself forwarded to Rome, after his departure from Ravenna. On discovering the
boastful language of our adversaries, as I could easily do in these extracts, I determined,
with the help of the Lord, to reply to their taunts with all the truthfulness and scriptural
authority that I could command.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—In This and the Four Next Chapters He Adduces the Garbled Extracts
He Has to Consider.</head>
<p>The paper which I now answer starts with this title: “Headings out of a book written by
Augustin, in reply to which I have culled a few passages out of books.” I perceive from this
that the person who forwarded these written papers to your Excellency wanted to make his
extracts out of the books he does not name, with a view, so far as I can judge, to getting a
quicker answer, in order that he might not delay your urgency. Now, after considering what
books they were which he meant, I suppose that it must have been those which Julianus
mentioned in the Epistle he sent to Rome,2194 a copy of which found its way to me at the
same time. For he there says: “They go so far as to allege that marriage, now in dispute, was
not instituted by God,—a declaration which may be read in a work of Augustin’s, to which
I have lately replied in a treatise of four books.” These are the books, as I believe, from which
the extracts were taken. It would, then, have been perhaps the better course if I had set myself
deliberately to disprove and refute that entire work of his,2195 which he spread out into four
volumes. But I was most unwilling to delay my answer, even as you yourself lost no time in
forwarding to me the written statements which I was requested to reply to.</p>
<note type="footnote">2194 See Augustin’s Unfinished Work against Julian, i. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">2195 This Augustin afterwards did by the publication of six book against Julianus, on receiving his entire

<head>Chapter 3.—The Same Continued.</head>
<p>The words which he has quoted and endeavoured to refute out of my book, which I
sent to you, and with which you are very well acquainted, are the following: “They are constantly
affirming, in their excessive hatred of us, that we condemn marriage and that divine
procedure by which God creates human beings by means of men and women, inasmuch as
we maintain that they who are born of such a union contract original sin, and do not deny
that, of whatever parents they are born, they are still under the devil’s dominion unless they
be born again in Christ.”2196 Now, in quoting these words of mine, he took care to omit the
testimony of the apostle, which I adduced by the weighty significance of which he felt himself
too hard pressed. For, after saying that men at their birth contract original sin, I at once introduced
the apostle’s words: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
so death passed upon all men, for in him all men sinned.”2197 Well, as I have already mentioned,
he omitted this passage of the apostle, and then closed up the other remarks of mine
which have been now quoted. For he knew too well how acceptable to the hearts and consciences
of all faithful catholics are these words of the apostle, which I had adopted, but
which he omitted,—words which are so direct and so clear, that these new-fangled heretics
use every effort in their dark and tortuous glosses to obscure and deprave their force.</p>

<p>But he has added other words of mine, where I have said: “Nor do they reflect that the
good of marriage is no more impeachable by reason of the original evil which is derived
therefrom, than the evil of adultery and fornication can be excused by reason of the natural
good which is born of them. For as sin is the work of the devil, whether derived from this
source or from that; so is man, whether born of this or that, the work of God.” Here, too,
he has left out some words, in which he was afraid of catholic ears. For to come to the words
here quoted, it had previously been said by us: “Because, then, we affirm this doctrine, which
is contained in the oldest and unvarying rule of the catholic faith, these propounders of
novel and perverse dogmas, who deny that there is in infants any sin to be washed away in
the laver of regeneration, in their unbelief or ignorance calumniate us as if we condemned
marriage, and as if we asserted to be the devil’s work what is God’s own work, to wit, the
human being which is born of marriage.”2198 All this passage he has passed over, and merely
quoted the words which follow it, as given above. Now, in the omitted words he was afraid
of the clause which suits all hearts in the catholic Church and appeals to the very faith which
has been firmly established and transmitted from ancient times with unfaltering voice and
excites their hostility most strongly against us. The clause is this: “They deny that there is
in infants any sin to be washed away in the laver of regeneration.” For all persons run to
church with their infants for no other reason in the world than that the original sin which
is contracted in them by their first and natural birth may be cleansed by the regeneration
of their second birth.</p>

<p>He then returns2199 to our words, which were quoted before: “We maintain that they
who are born of such a union contract original sin; and we do not deny that, of whatever
parents they are born, they are still under the devil’s dominion unless they be born again in
Christ.” Why he should again refer to these words of ours I cannot tell; he had already cited
them a little before. He then proceeds to quote what we said of Christ: “Who willed not to
be born from the same union of the two sexes.” But here again he quietly ignored the words
which I placed just previous to these words; my entire sentence being this: “That by His
grace they may be removed from the power of darkness, and translated into the kingdom
of Him who willed not to be born from the same union of the two sexes.” Observe, I pray
you, what my words were which he shunned, in the temper of one who is thoroughly opposed
to that grace of God which comes through our “Lord Jesus Christ.” He knows well enough
that it is the height of improbity and impiety to exclude infants from their interest in the
apostle’s words, where he said of God the Father: “Who hath delivered us from the power
of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear son.”2200 This, no doubt,
is the reason why he preferred to omit rather than quote these words.</p>

none of this shame-producing concupiscence, which is impudently praised by impudent
men, if man had not previously sinned; while as to marriage, it would still have existed, even
if no man had sinned: for the procreation of children would have been effected without this
disease.” Up to this point he cited my words; but he shrank from adding what comes
next—“in the body of that chaste life, although without it this cannot be done in ‘the body
of this death.’” He would not complete my sentence, but mutilated it somewhat, because he
dreaded the apostle’s exclamation, of which my words gave him a reminder: “O wretched
man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.”2201 For the body of this death existed not in paradise before sin;
therefore did we say, “In the body of that chaste life,” which was the life of paradise, “the
procreation of children could have been effected without the disease, without which now
in the body of this death it cannot be done.” The apostle, however, before arriving at that
mention of man’s misery and God’s grace which we have just quoted, had first said: “I see
another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into
captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.” Then it is that he exclaimed, “O wretched
man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.” In the body of this death, therefore, such as it was in paradise before
sin, there certainly was not “another law in our members warring against the law of our
mind”—which now, even when we are unwilling, and withhold consent, and use not our
members to fulfil that which it desires, still dwells in these members, and harasses our resisting
and repugnant mind. And this conflict in itself, although not involving condemnation,
because it does not consummate sin, is nevertheless “wretched,” inasmuch as it has no peace.
I think, then, that I have shown you clearly enough that this man had a special object as well
as method in quoting my words: he adduced them for refutation in such manner as in some
instances to interrupt the context of my sentences by removing what stood between them,
and in other instances to curtail them by withdrawing their concluding words; and his
reason for doing all this I think I have sufficiently explained.</p>

(See “The Unfinished Work,” i. 73.)</head>
<p>Let us now look at those words of ours which he adduced just as it suited him, and to
which he would oppose his own. For they are followed by his words; moreover, as the person
insinuated who sent you the paper of extracts, he copied something out of a preface, which
was no doubt the preface of the books from which he selected a few passages. The paragraph
thus copied stands as follows: “The teachers of our day, most holy brother,2202 who are the
instigators of the disgraceful faction which is now overheated with its zeal, are determined
on compassing the injury and discredit of the men with whose sacred fervour they are set
on fire, by nothing less than the ruin of the whole Church; little thinking how much honour
they have conferred on those whose renown they have shown to be only capable of being
destroyed along with the catholic religion. For, if one should say, either that there is free
will in man, or that God is the Creator of those that are born,2203 he is at once set down as
a Coelestian and a Pelagian. To avoid being called heretics, they turn Manicheans; and so,
whilst shirking a pretended infamy, they incur a real reproach; just like the animals, which
in hunting they surround with dyed feathers, in order to scare and drive them into their
nets;2204 the poor brutes are not gifted with reason, and so they are thrust all together by a
vain panic into a real destruction.”2205</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Augustin Refutes the Passage Adduced Above.</head>
<p>Well, now, whoever you are that have said all this, what you say is by no means true; by
no means, I repeat; you are much deceived, or you aim at deceiving others. We do not deny
free will; but, even as the Truth declares, “if the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be
free indeed.”2206 It is yourselves who invidiously deny this Liberator, since you ascribe a
vain liberty to yourselves in your captivity. Captives you are; for “of whom a man is overcome,”
as the Scripture says, “of the same is he brought in bondage;”2207 and no one except
by the grace of the great Liberator is loosed from the chain of this bondage, from which no
man living is free. For “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for in him all have sinned.”2208 Thus, then, God is the Creator
of those that are born in such wise that all pass from the one into condemnation, who have
not the One Liberator by regeneration. For He is described as “the Potter, forming out of
the same lump one vessel unto honour in His mercy, and another unto dishonour2209 in
judgment.” And so runs the Church’s canticle “mercy and judgment.”2210 You are therefore
only misleading yourself and others when you say, “If one should affirm, either that there
is free will in man, or that God is the Creator of those that are born, he is at once set down
as a Coelestian and a Pelagian;”2211 for the catholic faith says these things. If, however, any
one says that there is a free will in man for worshipping God aright, without His assistance;
and whosoever says that God is the Creator of those that are born in such wise as to deny
that infants have any need of one to redeem them from the power of the devil: that is the
man who is set down as a disciple of Coelestius and Pelagius. Therefore that men have
within them a free will, and that God is the Creator of those that are born, are propositions
which we both allow. You are not Coelestians and Pelagians for merely saying this. But what
you do really say is this, that any man whatever has freedom enough of will for doing good
without God’s help, and that infants undergo no such change as being “delivered from the
power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God;”2212 and because you say so,
you are Coelestians and Pelagians. Why, then, do you hide under the covering of a common
dogma for deceit, concealing your own especial delinquency which has gained for you a
party-name; and why, to terrify the ignorant with a shocking term, do you say of us, “To
avoid being called heretics, they turn Manicheans?”</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—The Catholics Maintain the Doctrine of Original Sin, and Thus are Far
from Being Manicheans.</head>
<p>Listen, then, for a little while, and observe what is involved in this question. Catholics
say that human nature was created good by the good God as Creator; but that, having been
corrupted by sin, it needs the physician Christ. The Manicheans affirm, that human nature
was not created by God good, and corrupted by sin; but that man was formed by the prince
of eternal darkness of a mixture of two natures which had ever existed—one good and the
other evil. The Pelagians and Coelestians say that human nature was created good by the
good God; but that it is still so sound and healthy in infants at their birth, that they have no
need at that age of Christ’s medicine. Recognise, then, your name in your dogma; and cease
from intruding upon the catholics, who refute you, a name and a dogma which belong to
others. For truth rejects both parties—the Manicheans and yourselves. To the Manicheans
it says: “Have ye not read that He which made man at the beginning, made them male and
female; and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his
wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh.
What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”2213 Now Christ shows,
in this passage, that God is both the Creator of man, and the uniter in marriage of husband
and wife; whereas the Manicheans deny both these propositions. To you, however, He says:
“The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.”2214 But you, admirable
Christians as you are, answer Christ: “If you came to seek and to save that which was lost,
then you did not come for infants; for they were not lost, but are born in a state of salvation:
go to older men; we give you a rule from your own words: ‘They that be whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick.’”2215 Now, as it happens, the Manichean, who says that
man has evil mixed in his nature, must wish his good soul at any rate to be saved by Christ;
whereas you contend that there is in infants nothing to be sired by Christ, since they are
already safe.2216 And thus the Manichean besets human nature with his detestable censure,
and you with your cruel praise. For whosoever shall believe your laudation, will never bring
their babes to the Saviour. Entertaining such impious views as these, of what use is it that
you fearlessly face that which is enacted for you2217 in order to induce salutary fear and to
treat you as a human being, and not as that poor animal of yours which was surrounded

hold the truth, and, on account of zeal for it, have no fear; but, as things are, you evade fear
in such wise that, if you feared, you would rather run away from the net of the malignant
one than run into it. The reason why your catholic mother alarms you is, because she fears
for both you and others from you; and if by the help of her sons who possess any authority
in the State she acts with a view to make you afraid, she does so, not from cruelty, but from
love. You, however, are a very brave man; and you deem it the coward’s part to be afraid of
men. Well then, fear God; and do not try with such obstinacy to subvert the ancient
foundations of the catholic faith. Although I could even wish that spirited temper of yours
would entertain some little fear of human authority, at least in the present case. I could wish,
I say, that it would rather tremble through cowardice than perish through audacity.</p>

<p>Now, the man who forwarded to your Love the paper in question has introduced the
contents thereof with this title: “In opposition to those persons who condemn matrimony,
and ascribe its fruits to the devil.” This, then, is not in opposition to us, who neither condemn
matrimony, which we even commend in its order with a just commendation, nor ascribe
its fruits to the devil. For the fruits of matrimony are men which are orderly engendered
from it, and not the sins which accompany their birth. Human beings are not under the
devil’s dominion because they are human beings, in which respect they are the fruits of
matrimony; but because they are sinful, in which resides the transmission of their sins. For
the devil is the author of sin, not of nature.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Eve’s Name Means Life, and is a Great Sacrament of the Church.</head>
<p>Now, observe the rest of the passage in which he thinks he finds, to our prejudice, what
is consonant with the above-quoted title. “God,” says he, “who had framed Adam out of the
dust of the ground, formed Eve out of his rib,2218 and said, She shall be called Life, because
she is the mother of all who live.” Well now, it is not so written. But what matters that to
us? For it constantly happens that our memory fails in verbal accuracy, while the sense is
still maintained. Nor was it God, but her husband, who gave Eve her name, which should
signify Life; for thus it is written: “And Adam called his wife’s name Life, because she is the
mother of all living.”2219 But very likely he might have understood the Scripture as testifying
that God gave Eve this name through Adam, as His prophet. For in that she was called Life,
and the mother of all living, there lies a great sacrament of the Church, of which it would
detain us long to speak, and which is unnecessary to our present undertaking. The very
same thing which the apostle says, “This is a great sacrament: but I speak concerning Christ
and the Church,” was also spoken by Adam when he said, “For this cause shall a man leave
his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they twain shall be one
flesh.”2220 The Lord Jesus, however, in the Gospel mentions God as having said this of Eve;
and the reason, no doubt, is, that God declared through the man what the man, in fact,
uttered as a prophecy. Now, observe what follows in the paper of extracts: “By that primitive
name,” says he, “He showed for what labour the woman had been provided; and He said
accordingly, ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.’”2221 Now, who amongst
ourselves denies that the woman was provided for the work of child-bearing by the Lord
God, the beneficent Creator of all good? See further what he goes on to say: “God, therefore,
who created them male and female,2222 furnished them with members suitable for procreation,
and ordained that bodies should be produced from bodies; and yet is security for their
capacity for effecting the work, executing all that exists with that power which He used in
creation.”2223 Well, even this we acknowledge to be catholic doctrine, as we also do with
regard to the passage which he immediately subjoins: “If, then, offspring comes only through

<head>Chapter 13.—The Pelagian Argument to Show that the Devil Has No Rights in the
Fruits of Marriage.</head>
<p>After these true and catholic statements, which are, moreover, really contained in the
Holy Scriptures, although they are not adduced by him in a catholic spirit, with the earnestness
of a catholic mind, he loses no time in introducing to us the heresy of Pelagius and
Coelestius, for which purpose he wrote, indeed, his previous remarks. Mark carefully the
following words: “You now who say, ‘We do not deny that they, are still, of whatever parents
born, under the devil’s power, unless they be born again in Christ,’ show us what the devil
can recognise as his own in the sexes, by reason of which he can (to use your phrase) rightly
claim as his property the fruit which they produce. Is it the difference of the sexes? But this
is inherent in the bodies which God made. Is it their union? But this union is justified in
the privilege of the primeval blessing no less than institution. For it is the voice of God that
says, ‘A man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they two
shall be one flesh.’2224 It is again the voice of God which says, ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and
replenish the earth.’2225 Or is it, perchance, their fertility? But this is the very reason why
matrimony was instituted.”</p>

<head>Chapter 14 <del>V.</del>—Concupiscence Alone, in Marriage, is Not of God.</head>
<p>You see the terms of his question to us: what the devil can find in the sexes to call his
own, by reason of which they should be in his power, who are born of parents of whatsoever
kind, unless they be born again in Christ; he asks us, moreover, whether it is the difference
in the sexes which we ascribe to the devil, or their union, or their very fruitfulness. We answer,
then, nothing of these qualities, inasmuch as the difference of sex belongs to “the vessels”
of the parents; while the union of the two pertains to the procreation of children; and their
fruitfulness to the blessing pronounced on the marriage institution. But all these things are
of God; yet amongst them he was unwilling to name that “lust of the flesh, which is not of
the Father, but is of the world;”2226 and “of this world” the devil is said to be “the prince.”2227
Now, the devil found no carnal concupiscence in the Lord, because the Lord did not come
as a man to men by its means. Accordingly, He says Himself: “The prince of this world
cometh, and findeth nothing in me”2228—nothing, that is, of sin; neither that which is derived
from birth, nor that which is added during life. Among all the natural goods of procreation
which he mentioned, he was, I repeat, unwilling to name this particular fact of concupiscence,
over which even marriage blushes, which glories in all these before-mentioned goods. For
why is the especial work of parents withdrawn and hidden even from the eyes of their children,
except that it is impossible for them to be occupied in laudable procreation without
shameful lust? Because of this it was that even they were ashamed who first covered their
nakedness.2229 These portions of their person were not suggestive of shame before, but deserved
to be commended and praised as the work of God. They put on their covering when
they felt their shame, and they felt their shame when, after their own disobedience to their
Maker, they felt their members disobedient to themselves. Our quoter of extracts likewise
felt ashamed of this concupiscence. For he mentioned the difference of the sexes; he mentioned
also their union, and he mentioned their fertility; but this last concomitant of lust
he blushed to mention. And no wonder if mere talkers are ashamed of that which we see
parents themselves, so interested in their function, blush to think of.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Man, by Birth, is Placed Under the Dominion of the Devil Through
Sin; We Were All One in Adam When He Sinned.</head>
<p>He then proceeds to ask: “Why, then, are they in the devil’s power whom God created?”
And he finds an answer to his own question apparently from a phrase of mine. “Because of
sin,” says he, “not because of nature.” Then framing his answer in reference to mine, he
says: “But as there cannot be offspring without the sexes, so there cannot be sin without the
will.” Yes, indeed, such is the truth. For even as “by one man sin entered into the world, and
death by sin; so also has death passed through to all men, for in him all have sinned.”2230
By the evil will of that one man all sinned in him, since all were that one man, from whom,
therefore, they individually derived original sin. “For you allege,” says he, “that the reason
why they are in the devil’s power is because they are born of the union of the two sexes.” I
plainly aver that it is by reason of transgression that they are in the devil’s power, and that
their participation, moreover, of this transgression is due to the circumstance that they are
born of the said union of the sexes, which cannot even accomplish its own honourable
function without the incident of shameful lust. This has also, in fact, been said by Ambrose,
of most blessed memory, bishop of the church in Milan, when he gives as the reason why
Christ’s birth in the flesh was free from all sinful fault, that His conception was not the result
of a union of the two sexes; whereas there is not one among human beings conceived in
such union who is without sin. These are his precise words: “On that account, and being
man, He was tried by every sort of temptation, and in the likeness of man He bore them all;
inasmuch, however, as He was born of the Spirit, He abstained from all sin. For every man
is a liar, and none is without sin, but God only. It has accordingly,” adds he, “been constantly
observed, that clearly no one who is born of a man and a woman, that is to say, through the
union of their bodies, is free from sin; for whoever is free from sin is free also from conception
of this kind.”2231 Well now, will you dare, ye disciples of Pelagius and Coelestius, to call this
man a Manichean? as the heretic Jovinian did, when the holy bishop maintained the permanent
virginity of the blessed Mary even after child-bearing, in opposition to this man’s
impiety. If, however, you do not dare to call him a Manichean, why do you call us Manicheans
when we defend the catholic faith in the self-same cause and with the self same opinions?
But if you will taunt that most faithful man with having entertained Manichean error in this
matter, there is no help for it, you must enjoy your taunts as best you may, and so fill up
Jovinian’s measure more fully; as for ourselves, we can patiently endure along with such a
man of God your taunts and jibes. And yet your heresiarch Pelagius commends Ambrose’s
faith and extreme purity in the knowledge of the Scriptures so greatly, as to declare that not
even an enemy could venture to find fault with him. Observe, then, to what length you have

gone, and refrain from following any further in the audacious steps of Jovinian. And yet
that man, although by his excessive commendation of marriage he put it on a par with holy
virginity, never denied the necessity of Christ to save those who are born of marriage even
fresh from their mother’s womb, and to redeem them from the power of the devil. This,
however, you deny; and because we oppose you in defence of those who cannot yet speak
for themselves, and in defence of the very foundations of the catholic faith, you taunt us,
with being Manicheans. But let us now see what comes next.</p>

<head>Chapter 16 <del>VI.</del>—It is Not of Us, But Our Sins, that the Devil is the Author.</head>
<p>He puts to us, then, another question, saying, “Whom, then, do you confess to be the
author of infants? The true God?” I answer:2232 “Yes; the true God.” He then remarks, “But
He did not make evil;” and again asks, “Whether we confess the devil to be the creator of
infants?” Then again he answers, “But he did not create human nature.” He then closes the
subject, as it were, with this inference: “Since union is evil, and the condition of our bodies
is degraded, therefore you ascribe our bodies to an evil creator.” My answer to this is, I do
not ascribe to an evil creator our bodies, but our sins; by reason of which it came to pass
that, whereas in our bodies, that is to say, in what God has made, all was honourable and
well-pleasing, there yet accrued in the intercourse of male and female what caused shame,
so that their union was not such as might have been in the body of that unimpaired life, but
such as we see with a blush in the body of this death. “But God,” says he, “has divided in sex
what He would unite in operation. So that from Him comes the union of bodies, from whom
first came the creation of bodies.” We have already furnished an answer to this statement,
when we said that these bodies are of God. But as regards the disobedience of the members
of these bodies, this comes through the lust of the flesh which “is not of the Father.”2233 He
goes on to say, that “it is impossible for evil fruits to spring from so many good things, such
as bodies, sexes, and their unions; or that human beings should be made by God for the
purpose of their being, by lawful right, as you maintain, held in possession by the devil.”
Now it has been already affirmed, that they are not thus held because they are men, which
designation belongs to their nature, of which the devil is not the author; but because they
are sinners, which designation is the result of that fault of nature of which the devil is the
author.</p>

Although They are Ashamed to Mention Its Name.</head>
<p>But among so many names of good things, such as bodies, sexes, unions, he never once
mentions the lust or concupiscence of the flesh. He is silent, because he is ashamed; and yet
with a strange shamelessness of shame (if the expression may be used), he is not ashamed
to praise what he is ashamed to mention. Now just observe how he prefers to point to his
object by circumlocution rather than by direct mention of it. “After that the man,” says he,
“by natural appetite knew his wife.” See again, he refused to say, He knew his wife by carnal
concupiscence; but he used the phrase, “by natural appetite,” by which it is open to us to
understand that holy and honourable will which wills the procreation of children, and not
that lust, of which even he is so much ashamed, forsooth, that he prefers to use ambiguous
language to us, to expressing his mind in unmistakeable words. “Now what is the meaning
of his phrase—“by natural appetite”? Is not both the wish to be saved and the wish to beget,
nourish, and educate children, natural appetite? and is it not likewise of reason, and not of
lust? Since, however, we can ascertain his intention, we are pretty sure that he meant by
these words to indicate the lust of the organs of generation. Do not the words in question
appear to you to be the fig-leaves, under cover of which is hidden nothing else but that
which he feels ashamed of? For just as they of old sewed the leaves together 2234 as a girdle
of concealment, so has this man woven a web of circumlocution to hide his meaning. Let
him weave out his statement: “But when the man knew his wife by natural appetite, the divine
Scripture says, Eve conceived, and bare a son, and called his name Cain. But what,” he adds,
“does Adam say? Let us hear: I have obtained a man from God. So that it is evident that he
was God’s work, and the divine Scripture testifies to his having been received from God.”
2235 Well, who can entertain a doubt on this point? Who can deny this statement, especially
if he be a catholic Christian? A man is God’s work; but carnal concupiscence (without which,
if sin had not preceded, man would have been begotten by means of the organs of generation,
not less obedient than the other members to a quiet and normal will) is not of the Father,
but is of the world.2236</p>

<p>But now, I pray you, look a little more attentively, and observe how he contrives to find
a name wherewith to cover again what he blushes to unfold. “For,” says he, “Adam begot
him by the power of his members, not by diversity of merits.” Now I confess I do not understand
what he meant by the latter clause, not by diversity of merits; but when he said, “by
the power of his members,” I believe he wished to express what he is ashamed to say openly
and clearly. He preferred to use the phrase, “by the power of his members,” rather than say,
“by the lust of the flesh.” Plainly—even if the thought did not occur to him—he intimated
a something which has an evident application to the subject. For what is more powerful
than a man’s members, when they are not in due submission to a man’s will? Even if they
be restrained by temperance or continence, their use and control are not in any man’s power.
Adam, then, begat his sons by what our author calls “the power of his members,” over which,
before he begat them, he blushed, after his sin. If, however, he had never sinned, he would
not have begotten them by the power, but in the obedience, of his members. For he would
himself have had the power to rule them as subjects to his will, if he, too, by the same will
had only submitted himself as a subject to a more powerful One.</p>

<head>Chapter 19 <del>VIII.</del>—The Pelagians Misunderstand “Seed” In Scripture.</head>
<p>He goes on to say: “After a while the divine Scripture says again, ‘Adam knew Eve his
wife; and she bare a son, and he called his name Seth: saying, The Lord hath raised me up
another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.’” He then adds: “The Divinity is said to have
raised up the seed itself; as a proof that the sexual union was His appointment.” This person
did not understand what the Scripture records; for he supposed that the reason why it is
said, The Lord hath raised me up another seed instead of Abel, was none other than that
God might be supposed to have excited in him a desire for sexual intercourse, by means
whereof seed might be raised for being poured into the woman’s womb. He was perfectly
unaware that what the Scripture has said is not “Has raised me up seed” in the sense he uses,
but only as meaning “Has given me a son.” Indeed, Adam did not use the words in question
after his sexual intercourse, when he emitted his seed, but after his wife’s confinement, in
which he received his son by the gift of God. For what gratification is there (except perhaps
for lascivious persons, and those who, as the apostle says with prohibition, “possess their
vessel in the lust of concupiscence”2237) in the mere shedding of seed as the ultimate pleasure
of sexual union, unless it is followed by the true and proper fruit of marriage—conception
and birth?</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Original Sin is Derived from the Faulty Condition of Human Seed.</head>
<p>This, however, I would not say, as implying at all that we must look for some other
creator than the supreme and true God, of either human seed or of man himself who comes
from the seed; but as meaning, that the seed would have issued from the human being by
the quiet and normal obedience of his members to his will’s command, if sin had not preceded.
The question now before us does not concern the nature of human seed, but its corruption.
Now the nature has God for its author; it is from its corruption that original sin is
derived. If, indeed, the seed had itself no corruption, what means that passage in the Book
of Wisdom, “Not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice
was inbred, and that their cogitation would never be changed; for their seed was accursed
from the beginning”?2238 Now whatever may be the particular application of these words,
they are spoken of mankind. How, then, is the malice of every man inbred, and his seed
cursed from the beginning, unless it be in respect of the fact, that “by one man sin entered
into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all have
sinned”?2239 But where is the man whose “evil cogitation can never be changed,” unless
because it cannot be effected by himself, but only by divine grace; without the assistance of
which, what are human beings, but that which the Apostle Peter says of them, when he describes
them as “natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed”?2240 Accordingly,
the Apostle Paul, in a certain passage, having both conditions in view,—even the wrath of
God with which we are born, and the grace whereby we are delivered,—says: “Among whom
also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires
of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But
God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were
dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ; by whose grace we are saved.”2241
What, then, is man’s “natural malice,” and “the seed cursed from the beginning;” and what
are “the natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed,” and what the “by nature
children of wrath”? Was this the condition of the nature which was formed in Adam? God
forbid! Inasmuch as his pure nature, however, was corrupted in him, it has run on in this
condition by natural descent through all, and still is running; so that there is no deliverance
for it from this ruin, except by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>What, therefore, is this man’s meaning, in the next passage, wherein he says concerning
Noah and his sons, that “they were blessed, even as Adam and Eve were; for God said unto
them, ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and have dominion over the earth’”?2242 To these words
of the Almighty he added some of his own, saying: “Now that pleasure, which you would
have seem diabolical, was resorted to in the case of the above-mentioned married pairs; and
it continued to exist, both in the goodness of its institution and in the blessing attached to
it. For there can be no doubt that the following words were addressed to Noah and his sons
in reference to their bodily connection with their wives, which had become by this time
unalterably fixed by use: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.’” It is unnecessary
for us to employ many words in repeating our former argument. The point here in question
is the corruption in our nature, whereby its goodness has been depraved, of which corruption
the devil is the author. That goodness of nature, as it is in itself, the author of which is God,
is not the question we have to consider. Now God has never withdrawn from corrupted and
depraved nature His own mercy and goodness, so as to deprive man of fruitfulness, vivacity,
and health, as well as the very substance of his mind and body, his senses also and reason,
as well as food, and nourishment, and growth. He, moreover, “maketh His sun to arise on
the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust;”2243 and all that
is good in human nature is from the good God, even in the case of those men who will not
be delivered from evil.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Shall We Be Ashamed of What We Do, or of What God Does?</head>
<p>It is, however, of pleasure that this man spoke in his passage, because pleasure can be
even honourable: of carnal concupiscence, or lust, which produces shame, he made no
mention. In some subsequent words, however, he uncovered his susceptibility of shame;
and he was unable to dissemble what nature herself has prescribed so forcibly. “There is
also,” says he, “that statement: ‘Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
shall cleave unto his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh.’” Then after these words of God,
he goes on to offer some of his own, saying: “That he might express faith in works, the
prophet approached very near to a perilling of modesty.” What a confession! How clear and
extorted from him by the force of truth! The prophet, it would seem, to express faith in
works, almost imperilled modesty, when he said, “They twain shall become one flesh;”
wishing it to be understood of the sexual union of the male and the female. Let the cause be
alleged, why the prophet, in expressing the works of God, should approach so near an imperilling
of modesty? Is it then the case that the works of man ought not to produce shame,
but must be gloried in at all events, and that the works of God must produce shame? Is it,
that in setting forth and expressing the works of God the prophet’s love or labour receives
no honour, but his modesty is imperilled? What, then, was it possible for God to do, which
it would be a shame for His prophet to describe? And, what is a weightier question still,
could a man be ashamed of any work which not man, but God, has made in man? whereas
workmen in all cases strive, with all the labour and diligence in their power, to avoid shame
in the works of their own hands. The truth, however, is, that we are ashamed of that very
thing which made those primitive human beings ashamed, when they covered their loins.
That is the penalty of sin; that is the plague and mark of sin; that is the temptation and very
fuel of sin; that is the law in our members warring against the law of our mind; that is the
rebellion against our own selves, proceeding from our very selves, which by a most righteous
retribution is rendered us by our disobedient members. It is this which makes us ashamed,
and justly ashamed. If it were not so, what could be more ungrateful, more irreligious in us,
if in our members we were to suffer confusion of face, not for our own fault or penalty, but
because of the works of God?</p>

Aroused Concupiscence as a Gift from Heaven.</head>
<p>He has much also to say, though to no purpose, concerning Abraham and Sarah, how
they received a son according to the promise; and at last he mentions the word concupiscence.
But he does not add the usual phrase, “of the flesh,” because this is the very thing which
causes the shame. Whereas, on account of concupiscence there is sometimes a call for
boasting, inasmuch as there is a concupiscence of the spirit against the flesh, 2244 and a
concupiscence of wisdom.2245 Accordingly, he says: “Now you have certainly defined as
naturally evil this concupiscence which is indispensable for fecundity; whence comes it,
therefore, that it is aroused in aged men by the gift of Heaven? Make it clear then, if you
can, that that belongs to the devil’s work, which you see is conferred by God as a gift.” He
says this, just as if concupiscence of the flesh had been previously wanting in them, and as
if God had bestowed it upon them. No doubt it was inherent in this body of death; that
fecundity, however, was wanting of which God is the author; and this was actually given
whensoever God willed to confer the gift. Be it, however, far from us to affirm, what he
thought we meant to say, that Isaac was begotten without the heat of sexual union.</p>

<head>Chapter 24 <del>XI.</del>—What Covenant of God the New-Born Babe Breaks. What Was
the Value of Circumcision.</head>
<p>But let him inform us how it was that his2246 soul would be cut off from his people if
he had not been circumcised on the eighth day. How could he have so sinned, how so offended
God, as to be punished for the neglect of others towards him with so severe a sentence,
had there been no original sin in the case? For thus ran the commandment of God concerning
the circumcision of infants: “The uncircumcised man-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is
not circumcised on the eighth day, his soul shall be cut off from his people; because he hath
broken my covenant.”2247 Let him tell us, if he can, how that child broke God’s covenant,—an
innocent babe, so far as he was personally concerned, of eight days’ age; and yet there is by
no means any falsehood uttered here by God or Holy Scripture. The fact is, the covenant of
God which he then broke was not this which commanded circumcision, but that which
forbade the tree; when “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for in him all have sinned.” 2248 And in his case the expiation
of this was signified by the circumcision of the eighth day, that is, by the sacrament of the
Mediator who was to be incarnate. For it was through this same faith in Christ, who was to
come in the flesh, and was to die for us, and on the third day (which coming after the seventh
or Sabbath day, was to be the eighth) to rise again, that even holy men were saved of old.
For “He was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.”2249 Ever since
circumcision was instituted amongst the people of God, which was at that time the sign of
the righteousness of faith, it availed also to signify the cleansing even in infants of the original
and primitive sin, just as baptism in like manner from the time of its institution began
to be of avail for the renewal of man. Not that there was no justification by faith before circumcision;
for even when he was still in uncircumcision, Abraham was himself justified by
faith, being the father of those nations which should also imitate his faith.2250 In former
times, however, the sacramental mystery of justification by faith lay concealed in every
mode. Still it was the self-same faith in the Mediator which saved the saints of old, both
small and great—not the old covenant, “which gendereth to bondage;”2251 not the law,
which was not so given as to be able to give life;2252 but the grace of God through Jesus

<p>“This sexual connection of bodies,” he says, “together with the ardour, with the pleasure,
with the emission of seed, was made by God, and is praiseworthy on its own account, and
is therefore to be approved; it, moreover, became sometimes even a great gift to pious men.”
He distinctly and severally repeated the phrases, “with ardour,” “with pleasure,” “with
emission of seed.” He did not, however, venture to say, “with lust.” Why is this, if it be not
that he is ashamed to name what he does not blush to praise? A gift, indeed, for pious men
is the prosperous propagation of children; but not that shame-producing excitement of the
members, which our nature would not feel were it in a sound state, although corrupted
nature now experiences it. On this account, indeed, it is that he who is born of it requires
to be born again, in order that he may be a member of Christ; and that he of whom he is
born, even though he be already born again, wants to be freed from that which exists in this
body of death by reason of the law of sin. Now since this is the case, how is it he goes on to
say, “You must, therefore, of necessity confess that the original sin which you had devised
is done away with”? It was not I who devised the original sin, which the catholic faith holds
from ancient times; but you, who deny it, are undoubtedly an innovating heretic. In the
judgment of God, all are in the devil’s power, born in sin, unless they are regenerated in

<head>Chapter 26 <del>XIII.</del>—The Child in No Sense Formed by Concupiscence.</head>
<p>But as he was speaking of Abraham and Sarah, he goes on to say: “If, indeed, you were
to affirm that the natural use was strong in them, and there was no offspring, my answer
will be: Whom the Creator promised, the Creator also gave; the child which is born is not
the work of cohabitation, but of God. He, indeed, who made the first man of the dust,
fashions all men out of seed. As, therefore, the dust of the earth, which was taken as the
material, was not the author of man; so likewise that power of sexual pleasure which forms
and commingles the seminal elements does not complete the entire process of man’s making,
but rather presents to God, out of the treasures of nature, material with which He vouchsafes
to make the human being.” Now the whole of this statement of his, except where he says,
that the seminal elements are formed and commingled by sexual pleasure, would be correctly
expressed by him were he only earnest in making it to defend the catholic sense. To us,
however, who are fully aware what he strives to make out of it, he speaks indeed correctly
in a perverse manner. The exceptional statement to the general truth, which I do not deny
belongs to this passage, is untrue for this reason, because the pleasure in question of carnal
concupiscence does not form the seminal elements. These are already in the body, and are
formed by the same true God who created the body itself. They do not receive their existence
from the libidinous pleasure, but are excited and emitted in company with it. Whether, indeed,
such pleasure accompanies the commingling of the seminal elements of the two sexes
in the womb, is a question which perhaps women may be able to determine from their inmost
feelings; but it is improper for us to push an idle curiosity so far. That concupiscence, however,
which we have to be ashamed of, and the shame of which has given to our secret
members their shameful designation, pudenda, had no existence in the body during its life
in paradise before the entrance of sin; but it began to exist “in the body of this death” after
sin, the rebellion of the members retaliating man’s own disobedience. Without this concupiscence
it was quite possible to effect the function of the wedded pair in the procreation
of children: just as many a laborious work is accomplished by the compliant operation of
our other limbs, without any lascivious heat; for they are simply moved by the direction of
the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence.</p>

<p>Carefully consider the rest of his remarks: “This likewise,” says he, “is confirmed by the
apostle’s authority. For when the blessed Paul spoke of the resurrection of the dead, he said,
“Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened.”2254 And afterwards, ‘But God giveth
it a body as it pleaseth Him, and to every seed its own body.’ If, therefore, God,” says he,
“has assigned to human seed, as to every thing else, its own proper body, which no wise or
pious man will deny, how will you prove that any person is born guilty? Do, I beg of you,
reflect with what a noose this assertion of natural sin is choked. But come,” he says, “deal
more gently with yourself, I pray you. Believe me, God made even you: it must, however,
be confessed, that a serious error has infected you. For what profaner opinion can be broached
than that either God did not make man, or else that He made him for the devil; or, at any
rate, that the devil framed God’s image, that is, man,—which clearly is a statement not more
absurd than impious? Is then,” says he, “God so poor in resources, so lacking in all sense of
propriety, as not to have had aught which He could confer on holy men as their reward,
except what the devil, after making them his dupes, might infuse into them for their vitiation?
2255 Would you like to know, however, that even in the case of those who are no saints,
God can be proved to have bestowed this power of procreation of children? When Abraham,
struck with fear among a foreign nation, said that Sarah, his wife, was his sister, it is said
that Abimelech, the king of the country, abducted her for a night’s enjoyment of her. But
God, who had the holy woman’s honour in His keeping, appeared to Abimelech in his sleep,
and restrained the royal audacity; threatening him with death if he went to the length of
violating the wife. Then Abimelech said: ‘Wilt thou, O Lord, slay an innocent and righteous
nation? Did they not tell me that they were brother and sister? Therefore Abimelech arose
early in the morning, and took a thousand pieces of silver, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants,
and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and sent away his wife untouched.
But Abraham prayed unto God for Abimelech; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife,
and his maid-servants.’”2256 Now why he narrated all this at so great a length, you may find
in these few words which he added: “God,” he says, “at the prayer of Abraham, restored
their potency of generation, which had been taken away from the wombs of even the
meanest servants; because God had closed up every womb in the house of Abimelech.2257

<head>Chapter 28 <del>XIV.</del>—Augustin’s Answer to This Argument. Its Dealing with Scripture.</head>
<p>Now to this lengthy statement of his we have to say in answer, that, in the passages
which he has quoted from the sacred writings, there is nothing said about that shameful
lust, which we say did not exist in the body of our first parents in their blessedness, when
they were naked and were not ashamed.2258 The first passage from the apostle was spoken
of the seeds of corn, which first die in order to be quickened. For some reason or other, he
was unwilling to complete the verse for his quotation. All he adduces from it is: “Thou fool,
that which thou sowest is not quickened;” but the apostle adds, “except it die.”2259 This
writer, however, so far as I can judge, wished this passage, which treats only of corn seeds,
to be understood of human seed, by such as read it without either understanding the Holy
Scriptures or recollecting them. Indeed, he not merely curtailed this particular sentence, by
omitting the clause, “except it die,” but he omitted the following words, in which the apostle
explained of what seeds he was speaking; for the apostle adds: “And that which thou sowest,
thou sowest not that body which shall be, but the bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of
some other grain.”2260 This he omitted, and closed up his context with what the apostle
then writes: “But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed its own
body;” just as if the apostle spoke of man in cohabitation when he said, “Thou fool, that
which thou sowest is not quickened,” with a view to our understanding of human seed, that
it is quickened by God, not by man in cohabitation begetting children. For he had previously
said: “Sexual pleasure does not complete the entire process of man’s making, but rather
presents to God, out of the treasures of nature, material with which He vouchsafes to make
the human being.”2261 He then added the quotation, as if the apostle affirmed as follows:
Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,—quickened, that is, by thyself; but God
forms the human being out of thy seed. As if the apostle had not said the intermediate words,
which this writer chose to pass over; and as if the apostle’s aim was to speak of human seed
thus: “Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened; but God giveth to the seed a body
such as pleaseth Him, and to every seed its own body.” Indeed, after the apostle’s words, he
introduces remarks of his own to this effect: “If, therefore, God has assigned to human seed,
as to everything else, its own proper body, which no wise or pious man will deny;” quite as
if the apostle in the passage in question spoke of human seed.</p>

spoken of corn seeds, and not of human, in this passage, we should have suggested to us at
once by such procedure of his, how to refute him: not indeed as the pure-minded advocate
of a chastened will, but as the impudent proclaimer of a profligate voluptuousness. But from
the very seeds, forsooth, which the farmers sow in their fields he can be refuted. For why
can we not suppose that God could have granted to man in his happy state in paradise, the
same course with regard to his own seed which we see granted to the seeds of corn, in such
wise that the former might be sown without any shameful lust, the members of generation
simply obeying the inclination of the will; just as the latter is sown without any shameful
lust, the hands of the husbandman merely moving in obedience to his will? There being,
indeed, this difference, that the desire of begetting children in the parent is a nobler one
than that which characterizes the farmer, of filling his barns. Then, again, why might not
the almighty Creator, with His incontaminable ubiquity, and his power of creating from
human seed just what it pleased Him, have operated in women, with respect to what He
even now makes, in the self-same manner as He operates in the ground with corn seeds according
to His will, making blessed mothers conceive without lustful passion, and bring
forth children without parturient pains, inasmuch as there was not (in that state of happiness,
and in the body which was not as yet the body of this death, but rather of that life) in woman
when receiving seed anything to produce shame, as there was nothing when giving birth to
offspring to cause pain? Whoever refuses to believe this, or is unwilling to have it supposed
that, while men previous to any sin lived in that happy state of paradise, such a condition
as that which we have sketched could not have been permitted in God’s will and kindness,
must be regarded as the lover of shameful pleasure, rather than the encomiast of desirable
fecundity.</p>

<head>Chapter 30 <del>XV.</del>—The Case of Abimelech and His House Examined.</head>
<p>Then, again, as to the passage which he has adduced from the inspired history concerning
Abimelech, and God’s choosing to close up every womb in his household that the women
should not bear children, and afterwards opening them that they might become fruitful,
what is all this to the point? What has it to do with that shameful concupiscence which is
now the question in dispute? Did God, then, deprive those women of this feeling, and give
it to them again just when He liked? The punishment however, was that they were unable
to bear children, and the blessing that they were able to bear them, after the manner of this
corruptible flesh. For God would not confer such a blessing upon this body of death, as only
that body of life in paradise could have had before sin entered; that is, the process of conceiving
without the prurience of lust, and of bearing children without excruciating pain.
But why should we not suppose, since, indeed, Scripture says that every womb was closed,
that this took place with something of pain, so that the women were unable to bear cohabitation,
and that God inflicted this pain in His wrath, and removed it in His mercy? For if lust
was to be taken away as an impediment to begetting offspring, it ought to have been taken
away from the men, not from the women. For a woman might perform her share in cohabitation
by her will, even if the lust ceased by which she is stimulated, provided it were not
absent from the man for exciting him; unless, perhaps (as Scripture informs us that even
Abimelech himself was healed), he would tell us that virile concupiscence was restored to
him. If, however, it were true that he had lost this, what necessity was there that he should
be warned by God to hold no connection with Abraham’s wife? The truth is, Abimelech is
said to have been healed, because his household was cured of the affliction which smote it.</p>

<head>Chapter 31 <del>XVI.</del>—Why God Proceeds to Create Human Beings, Who He Knows
Will Be Born in Sin.</head>
<p>Let us now look at those three clauses of his, than which three, he says, nothing more
profane could possibly be uttered: “Either God did not make man, or else He made him for
the devil; or, at any rate, the devil framed God’s image, that is, man.” Now, the first and the
last of these sentences, even he himself must allow, if he be not reckless and perverse, were
never uttered by us. The dispute is confined to that which he puts second between the other
two. In respect of this, he is so far mistaken as to suppose that we had said that God made
man for the devil; as if, in the case of human beings whom God creates of human parents,
His care and purpose and provision were, that by means of His workmanship the devil
should have as slaves those whom he is unable to make for himself. God forbid that any sort
of pious belief, however childish, should ever entertain such a sentiment as this! Of His own
goodness God has made man—the first without sin, all others under sin—for the purposes
of His own profound thoughts. For just as He knew full well what to do with reference to
the malice of the devil himself, and what He does is just and good, however unjust and evil
he is, about whom He takes His measures; and just as He was not unwilling to create him
because He foresaw that he would be evil; so in regard to the entire human race, though not
a man of it is born without the taint of sin, He who is supremely good Himself is always
working out good, making some men, as it were, “vessels of mercy,” whom grace distinguishes
from those who are “vessels of wrath;” whilst He makes others, as it were, “vessels of wrath,”
that He may make known the riches of His glory towards the vessels of mercy.2262 Let, then,
this objector go and contest the point against the apostle, whose words I use; nay, against
the very Potter, whom the apostle forbids us answering again, in the well-known words:
“Who art thou, O man, that repliest against God! Shall the thing formed say to him that
formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the
same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?” 2263 Well now,
will this man contend that the vessels of wrath are not under the dominion of the devil? or
else, because they are under this dominion, are they made by another creator than He who
makes the vessels of mercy? Or does He make them of other material, and not out of the
self-same lump? Here, then, he may object, and say: “Therefore God makes these vessels
for the devil.” As if God knew not how to make such a use of even these for the furtherance
of His own good and righteous works, as He makes of the very devil himself.</p>

evil just in the same way as He feeds and nourishes the evil; because what He bestows on
them by creating them appertains to the goodness of nature; and the growth which He gives
them by food and nourishment, He bestows on them, of course, as a kindly help, not to their
evil character, but to that same good nature which He in His goodness created. For in as far
as they are human beings—this is a good of that nature whose author and maker is God;
but in as far as they are born with sin and so destined to perdition unless they are born again,
they belong to the seed which was cursed from the beginning,2266 by the fault of the primitive
disobedience. This fault, however, is turned to good account by the Maker of even the vessels

<p>From this most true and firmly-established principle of the apostolic and catholic faith
the writer before us departs in company with the Pelagians. He will not have it that men are
born under the dominion of the devil, lest infants be carried to Christ to be delivered from
the power of darkness, and to be translated into His kingdom.2269 Thus he becomes the
accuser of the Church which is spread over the world; into this Church everywhere infants,
when to be baptized, are first exorcised, for no other reason than that the prince of this
world may be cast out2270 of them. For by him must they be necessarily possessed, as vessels
of wrath, since they are born of Adam, unless they be born again in Christ, and transferred
through grace as vessels of mercy into His kingdom. In his attack, however, upon this most
firmly-established truth, he would avoid the appearance of an assault upon the entire Church
of Christ. Accordingly, he limits his appeal to me alone, and in the tone of reproof and admonition
he says: “But God made even you, though it must be confessed that a serious error
has infected you.” Well now, I thankfully acknowledge that God did make even me; and
still I must have perished with the vessels of wrath, if He had only made me of Adam, and
had not re-made me in Christ. Possessed, however, as this man is with the heresy of Pelagius,
he does not believe this: if, indeed, he persists in so great an error to the very end, then not
he, but catholics, will be able to see the character and extent of the error which has not
simply infected, but absolutely destroyed2271 him.</p>

<head>Chapter 34 <del>XIX.</del>—The Pelagians Argue that Cohabitation Rightly Used is a Good,
and What is Born from It is Good.</head>
<p>I request your attention now to the following words. He says, “That children, however,
who are conceived in wedlock are by nature good, we may learn from the apostle’s words,
when he speaks of men who, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust,
men with men working together that which is disgraceful.2272 Here,” says he, “the apostle
shows the use of the woman to be both natural and, in its way, laudable; the abuse consisting
in the exercise of one’s own will in opposition to the decent use of the institution. Deservedly
then,” says he, “in those who make a right use thereof, concupiscence is commended in its
kind and mode; whilst the excess of it, in which abandoned persons indulge, is punished.
Indeed, at the very time when God punished the abuse in Sodom with His judgment of fire,
He invigorated the generative powers of Abraham and Sarah, which had become impotent
through old age.2273 If, therefore,” he goes on to say, “you think that fault must be found
with the strength of the generative organs, because the Sodomites were steeped in sin thereby,
you will have also to censure such created things as bread and wine, since Holy Scripture
informs us that they sinned also in the abuse of these gifts. For the Lord, by the mouth of
His prophet Ezekiel, says: ‘These, moreover, were the sins of thy sister Sodom; in their pride,
she and her children overflowed in fulness of bread and abundance of wine; and they helped
not the hand of the poor and needy.’2274 Choose, therefore,” says he, “which alternative you
would rather have: either impute to the work of God the sexual connection of human bodies,
or account such created things as bread and wine to be equally evil. But if you should prefer
this latter conclusion, you prove yourself to be a Manichean. The truth, however, is this: he
who observes moderation in natural concupiscence uses a good thing well; but he who does
not observe moderation, abuses a good thing. What means your statement, then,”2275 he
asks, “when you say that ‘the good of marriage is no more impeachable on account of the
original sin which is derived herefrom, than the evil of adultery and fornication can be excused
because of the natural good which is born of them’? In these words,” says he, “you
conceded what you had denied, and what you had conceded you nullified; and you aim at
nothing so much as to be unintelligible. Show me any bodily marriage without sexual connection.
Else impose some one name on this operation, and designate the conjugal union
as either a good or an evil. You answer, no doubt, that you have already defined marriages
to be good. Well then, if marriage is good,—if the human being is the good fruit of marriage;

<head>Chapter 35 <del>XX.</del>—He Answers the Arguments of Julianus. What is the Natural Use
of the Woman? What is the Unnatural Use?</head>
<p>My answer to this challenge is, that not only the children of wedlock, but also those of
adultery, are a good work in so far as they are the work of God, by whom they are created:
but as concerns original sin, they are all born under condemnation of the first Adam; not
only those who are born in adultery, but likewise such as are born in wedlock, unless they
be regenerated in the second Adam, which is Christ. As to what the apostle says of the
wicked, that “leaving the natural use of the woman, the men burned in their lust one toward
another: men with men working that which is unseemly;”2276 he did not speak of the conjugal
use, but the “natural use,” wishing us to understand how it comes to pass that by means of
the members created for the purpose the two sexes can combine for generation. Thus it
follows, that even when a man unites with a harlot to use these members, the use is a natural
one. It is not, however, commendable, but rather culpable. But as regards any part of the
body which is not meant for generative purposes, should a man use even his own wife in it,
it is against nature and flagitious. Indeed, the same apostle had previously2277 said concerning
women: “Even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature;”
and then concerning men he added, that they worked that which is unseemly by leaving the
natural use of the woman. Therefore, by the phrase in question, “the natural use,” it is not
meant to praise conjugal connection; but thereby are denoted those flagitious deeds which
are more unclean and criminal than even men’s use of women, which, even if unlawful, is
nevertheless natural.</p>

<head>Chapter 36 <del>XXI.</del>—God Made Nature Good: the Saviour Restores It When Corrupted.</head>
<p>Now we do not reprehend bread and wine because some men are luxurious and
drunkards, any more than we disapprove of gold because of the greedy and avaricious.
Wherefore on the same principle we do not censure the honourable connection between
husband and wife, because of the shame-causing lust of bodies. For the former would have
been quite possible before any antecedent commission of sin, and by it the united pair would
not have been made to blush; whereas the latter arose after the perpetration of sin, and they
were obliged to hide it, from very shame.2278 Accordingly, in all united pairs ever since,
however well and lawfully they have used this evil, there has been a permanent necessity of
avoiding the sight of man in any work of this kind, and thus acknowledging what caused
inevitable shame, though a good thing would certainly cause no man to be ashamed. In this
way we have two distinct facts insensibly introduced to our notice: the good of that laudable
union of the sexes for the purpose of generating children; and the evil of that shameful lust,
in consequence of which the offspring must be regenerated in order to escape condemnation.
The man, therefore, who, though with the lust which causes shame, joins in lawful cohabitation,
turns an evil to good account; whereas he who joins in an unlawful cohabitation uses
an evil badly; for that is more correctly called evil than good, at which both bad and good
alike blush. We do better to believe him who has said, “I know that in me, that is, in my
flesh, dwelleth no good thing,”2279 rather than him who calls that good, by which he is so
conformed that he admits it to be evil; but if he feels no shame, he adds the worse evil of
impudence. Rightly then did we declare that “the good of marriage is no more impeachable
because of the original sin which is derived therefrom, than the evil of adultery and fornication
can be excused, because of the natural good which is born of them:” since the human
nature which is born, whether of wedlock or of adultery, is the work of God. Now if this
nature were an evil, it ought not to have been born; if it had not evil, it would not have to
be regenerated: and (that I may combine the two cases in one and the same predicate) if
human nature were an evil thing, it would not have to be saved; if it had not in it any evil,
it would not have to be saved. He, therefore, who contends that nature is not good, says that
the Maker of the creature is not good; whilst he who will have it, that nature has no evil in
it, deprives it in its corrupted condition of a merciful Saviour. From this, then, it follows,
that in the birth of human beings neither fornication is to be excused on account of the good
which is formed out of it by the good Creator, nor is marriage to be impeached by reason
of the evil which has to be healed in it by the merciful Saviour.</p>

<p>“Show me,” he says, “any bodily marriage without sexual connection.” I do not show
him any bodily marriage without sexual connection; but then, neither does he show me any
case of sexual connection which is without shame. In paradise, however, if sin had not preceded,
there would not have been, indeed, generation without union of the sexes, but this
union would certainly have been without shame; for in the sexual union there would have
been a quiet acquiescence of the members, not a lust of the flesh productive of shame.
Matrimony, therefore, is a good, in which the human being is born after orderly conception;
the fruit, too, of matrimony is good, as being the very human being which is thus born; sin,
however, is an evil with which every man is born. Now it was God who made and still makes
man; but “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed

Jovinian, too, who endeavoured a few years ago to found a new heresy, used to declare that
the catholics patronized the Manicheans, because in opposition to him they preferred holy
virginity to marriage. But this man is sure to reply, that he does not agree with Jovinian in
his indifference about marriage and virginity. I do not myself say that this is their opinion;
still these new heretics must allow, by the fact of Jovinian’s playing off the Manicheans upon
the catholics, that the expedient is not a novel one. We then declare that marriage is a good,
not an evil. But just as the Arians charge us with being Sabellians, although we do not say
that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one and the same, as the Sabellians
hold; but affirm that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost have one and the same
nature, as the catholics believe: so do the Pelagians cast the Manicheans in our teeth, although
we do not declare marriage to be an evil, as the Manicheans pretend, but affirm that evil
accrued to the first man and woman, that is to say, to the first married pair, and from them
passed on to all men, as the catholics hold. As, however, the Arians, while avoiding the
Sabellians, fall into worse company, because they have had the audacity to divide not the
Persons of the Trinity, but the natures; so the Pelagians, in their efforts to escape from the
pestilent error of the Manicheans, by taking the opposite extreme, are convicted of entertaining

wedlock, but to its seminal elements: the cause of these, however, lies in the condition of
bodies; and whosoever makes a bad use of these bodies, deals a blow at the good desert
thereof, not at their nature. It is therefore clear,” argues he, “that the good is not the cause
of the evil. If, therefore,” he continues, “original evil is derived even from marriage, the cause
of the evil is the compact of marriage; and that must needs be evil by which and from which
the evil fruit has made its appearance; even as the Lord says in the Gospel: ‘A tree is known
by its fruits.’ 2282 How then,” he asks, “do you think yourself worthy of attention, when you
say that marriage is good, and yet declare that nothing but evil proceeds from it? It is evident,
then, that marriages are guilty, since original sin is deduced from them; and they are indefensible,
too, unless their fruit be proved innocent. But they are defended, and pronounced good;

<head>Chapter 42.—The Pelagians Try to Get Rid of Original Sin by Their Praise of God’s
Works; Marriage, in Its Nature and by Its Institution, is Not the Cause of Sin.</head>
<p>I have an answer ready for all this; but before I give it, I wish the reader carefully to notice,
that the result of the opinions of these persons is, that no Saviour is necessary for infants,
whom they deem to be entirely without any sins to be saved from. This vast perversion of
the truth, so hostile to God’s great grace, which is given through our Lord Jesus Christ, who
“came to seek and to save what was lost,”2283 tries to insinuate its way into the hearts of the
unintelligent by eulogizing the works of God; that is, by its eulogy of human nature, of human
seed, of marriage, of sexual intercourse, of the fruits of matrimony—which are all of them
good things. I will not say that he adds the praise of lust; because he too is ashamed even to
name it, so that it is something else, and not it, which he seems to praise. By this method of
his, not distinguishing between the evils which have accrued to nature and the goodness of
nature’s very self, he does not, indeed, show it to be sound (because that is untrue), but he
does not permit its diseased condition to be healed. And, therefore, that first proposition
of ours, to the effect that the good thing, even the human being, which is born of adultery,
does not excuse the sin of adulterous connection, he allows to be true; and this point, which
occasions no question to arise between us, he even defends and strengthens (as he well may)
by his similitude of the thief who sows the seed which he stole, and out of which there arises
a really good harvest. Our other proposition, however, that “the good of marriage cannot
be blamed for the original sin which is derived from it,” he will not admit to be true; if, indeed,
he assented to it, he would not be a Pelagian heretic, but a catholic Christian. “Certainly,”
says he, “if evil arises from marriage, it may be blamed, nay, cannot be excused; and you
place its work and fruit under the devil’s power, because everything which is the cause of
evil is itself without good.” And in addition to this, he contrived other arguments to show
that good could not possibly be the cause of evil; and from this he drew the inference, that
marriage, which is a good, is not the cause of evil; and that consequently from it no man
could be born in a sinful state, and having need of a Saviour: just as if we said that marriage
is the cause of sin, though it is true that the human being which is born in wedlock is not
born without sin. Marriage was instituted not for the purpose of sinning, but of producing
children. Accordingly the Lord’s blessing on the married state ran thus: “Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth.”2284 The sin, however, which is derived to children from
marriage does not belong to marriage, but to the evil which accrues to the human agents,
from whose union marriage comes into being. The truth is, both the evil of shameful lust
can exist without marriage, and marriage might have been without it. It appertains, however,
to the condition of the body (not of that life, but) of this death, that marriage cannot exist
<note type="footnote">2283 Luke xix. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">2284 Gen. i. 28.</note>

<pb n="862"/>
without it though it may exist without marriage. Of course that lust of the flesh which causes
shame has existence out of the married state, whenever it urges men to the commission of
adultery, chambering and uncleanness, so utterly hostile to the purity of marriage; or again,
when it does not commit any of these things, because the human agent gives no permission
or assent to their commission, but still rises and is set in motion and creates disturbance,
and (especially in dreams) effects the likeness of its own veritable work, and reaches the end
of its own emotion. Well, now, this is an evil which is not even in the married state actually
an evil of marriage; but it has this apparatus all ready in the body of this death, even against
its own will, which is indispensable no doubt for the accomplishment of that which it does
will. The evil in question, therefore, does not accrue to marriage from its own institution,
which was blessed; but entirely from the circumstance that sin entered into the world by
one man, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.2285</p>

<head>Chapter 43.—The Good Tree in the Gospel that Cannot Bring Forth Evil Fruit, Does
Not Mean Marriage.</head>
<p>What, then, does he mean by saying, “A tree is known by its fruits,” on the ground of
our reading that the Lord spake thus in the Gospel? Was, then, the Lord speaking of this
question in these words, and not rather of men’s two wills, the good and the evil, calling
one of these the good tree, and the other the corrupt tree, inasmuch as good works spring
out of a good will, and evil ones out of an evil will—the converse being impossible, good
works out of an evil will, and evil ones out of a good will? If, however, we were to suppose
marriage to be the good tree, according to the Gospel simile which he has mentioned, then,
of course, we must on the other hand assume fornication to be the corrupt tree. Wherefore,
if a human being is said to be the fruit of marriage, in the sense of the good fruit of a good
tree, then undoubtedly a human being could never have been born in fornication. “For a
corrupt tree bringeth not forth good fruit.” 2286 Once more, if he were to say that not adultery
must be supposed to occupy the place of the tree, but rather human nature, of which man
is born, then in this way not even marriage can stand for the tree, but only the human nature
of which man is born. His simile, therefore, taken from the Gospel avails him nothing in
elucidating this question, because marriage is not the cause of the sin which is transmitted
in the natural birth, and atoned for in the new birth; but the voluntary transgression of the
first man is the cause of original sin. “You repeat,” says he, “your allegation, ‘Just as sin,
from whatever source it is derived to infants, is the work of the devil, so man, howsoever
he be born, is the work of God.’” Yes, I said this, and most truly too; and if this man were
not a Pelagian, but a catholic, he too would have nothing else to avow in the catholic faith.</p>

<head>Chapter 44 <del>XXVII.</del>—The Pelagians Argue that If Sin Comes by Birth, All Married
People Deserve Condemnation.</head>
<p>What, then, is his object when he inquires of us, “By what means sin may be found in
an infant, through the will, or through marriage, or through its parents”? He speaks, indeed,
in such a way as if he had an answer to all these questions, and as if by clearing all of sin together
he would have nothing remain in the infant whence sin could be found. I beg your
attention to his very words: “Through what,” says he, “is sin found in an infant? Through
the will? But there has never been one in him? Through marriage? But this appertains to
the parents’ work, of whom you had previously declared that in this action they had not
sinned; though it appears from your subsequent words that you did not make this concession
truly. Marriage, therefore,” he says, “must be condemned, since it furnished the cause of
the evil. Yet marriage only indicates the work of personal agents. The parents, therefore,
who by their coming together afforded occasion for the sin, are properly deserving of the
condemnation. It does not then admit of doubt,” says he, “any longer, if we are to follow
your opinion, that married persons are handed over to eternal punishment, it being by their
means brought about that the devil has come to exercise dominion over men. And what
becomes of what you just before had said, that man was the work of God? Because if through
their birth it happens that evil is in men, and through the evil that the devil has power over
men, so in fact you declare the devil to be the author of men, from whom comes their origin
at birth. If, however, you believe that man is made by God, and that husband and wife are
innocent, see how impossible is your standpoint, that original sin is derived from them.”</p>

<head>Chapter 45.—Answer to This Argument: The Apostle Says We All Sinned in One.</head>
<p>Now, there is an answer for him to all these questions given by the apostle, who censures
neither the infant’s will, which is not yet matured in him for sinning, nor marriage, which,
as such, has not only its institution, but its blessing also, from God; nor parents, so far as
they are parents, who are united together properly and lawfully for the procreation of children;
but he says, “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death
passed upon all men for in him all have sinned.”2287 Now, if these persons would only receive
this statement with catholic hearts and ears, they would not have rebellious feelings against
the grace and faith of Christ, nor would they vainly endeavour to convert to their own particular
and heretical sense these very clear and manifest words of the apostle, when they
assert that the purport of the passage is to this effect: that Adam was the first to sin, and that
any one who wished afterwards to commit sin found an example for sinning in him; so that
sin, you must know, did not pass from this one upon all men by birth, but by the imitation
of this one. Whereas it is certain that if the apostle meant this imitation to be here understood,
he would have said that sin had entered into the world and passed upon all men, not by one
man, but rather by the devil. For of the devil it is written: “They that are on his side do imitate
him.”2288 He used the phrase “by one man,” from whom the generation of men, of course,
had its beginning, in order to show us that original sin had passed upon all men by generation.</p>

<head>Chapter 46.—The Reign of Death, What It Is; The Figure of the Future Adam; How
All Men are Justified Through Christ.</head>
<p>But what else is meant even by the apostle’s subsequent words? For after he had said
the above, he added, “For until the law sin was in the world,”2289 as much as to say that not
even the law was able to take away sin. “But sin,” adds he, “was not imputed when there was
no law.”2290 It existed then, but was not imputed, for it was not set forth so that it might be
imputed. It is on the same principle, indeed, that he says in another passage: “By the law is
the knowledge of sin.”2291 “Nevertheless,” says he, “death reigned from Adam to Moses;”2292
that is, as he had already expressed it, “until the law.” Not that there was no sin after Moses,
but because even the law, which was given by Moses, was unable to deprive death of its
power, which, of course, reigns only by sin. Its reign, too, is such as to plunge mortal man
even into that second death which is to endure for evermore. “Death reigned,” but over
whom? “Even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression,
who is the figure of Him that was to come.”2293 Of whom that was to come, if not Christ?
And in what sort a figure, except in the way of contrariety? which he elsewhere briefly expresses:
“As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”2294 The one condition
was in one, even as the other condition was in the other; this is the figure. But this figure is
not conformable in every respect; accordingly the apostle, following up the same idea, added,
“But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be
dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ,
hath abounded unto many.”2295 But why “hath it much more abounded,” except it be that
all who are delivered through Christ suffer temporal death on Adam’s account, but have
everlasting life in store for the sake of Christ Himself? “And not as it was by one that sinned,”
says he, “so is the gift: for the judgment was from one to condemnation, but the free gift is
from many offences unto justification.”2296 “By one” what, but offence? since it is added,
“the free gift is from many offences.” Let these objectors tell us how it can be “by one offence
unto condemnation,” unless it be that even the one original sin which has passed over unto
all men is sufficient for condemnation? Whereas the free gift delivers from many offences

<pb n="867"/>
to justification, because it not only cancels the one offence, which is derived from the
primal sin, but all others also which are added in every individual man by the motion of his
own will. “For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive
abundance of grace and righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ. Therefore, by
the offence of one upon all men to condemnation; so by the righteousness of one upon all
men unto justification of life.”2297 Let them after this persist in their vain imaginations, and
maintain that one man did not hand on sin by propagation, but only set the example of
committing it. How is it, then, that by one’s offence judgment comes on all men to condemnation,
and not rather by each man’s own numerous sins, unless it be that even if there were
but that one sin, it is sufficient, without the addition of any more, to lead to condemnation,—
as, indeed, it does lead all who die in infancy who are born of Adam, without being
born again in Christ? Why, then, does he, when he refuses to hear the apostle, ask us for an
answer to his question, “By what means may sin be discovered in an infant,—through the
will, or through marriage, or through its parents?” Let him listen in silence, and hear by
what means sin may be discovered in an infant. “By the offence of one,” says the apostle,
“upon all men to condemnation.” He said, moreover, all to condemnation through Adam,
and all to justification through Christ: not, of course, that Christ removes to life all those
who die in Adam; but he said “all” and “all,” because, as without Adam no one goes to death,
so without Christ no man to life. Just as we say of a teacher of letters, when he is alone in a
town: This man teaches all their learning; not because all the inhabitants take lessons, but
because no man who learns at all is taught by any but him. Indeed, the apostle afterwards
designates as many those whom he had previously described as all, meaning the self-same
persons by the two different terms. “For,” says he, “as by one man’s disobedience many were
made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”2298</p>

by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.” “Through the offence of
one many are dead.” “The judgment was from one to condemnation.” “By one man’s offence
death reigned by one.” “By the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation.”
“By one man’s disobedience many were made sinners.”2299 Behold, then, “by what

door? “By one man,” says the apostle; “through the offence of one,” says the apostle; “By

<head>Chapter 48.—Original Sin Arose from Adam’s Depraved Will. Whence the Corrupt
Will Sprang.</head>
<p>“If,” says he, “sin comes from the will, it is an evil will that causes sin; if it comes from
nature, then nature is evil.” I at once answer, Sin does come from the will. Perhaps he wants
to know, whether original sin also? I answer, most certainly original sin also. Because it, too,
was engendered from the will of the first man; so that it both existed in him, and passed on
to all. As for what he next proposes, “If it comes from nature, then nature is evil,” I request
him to answer, if he can, to this effect: As it is manifest that all evil works spring from a
corrupt will, like the fruits of a corrupt tree; so let him say whence arose the corrupt will itself—
the corrupt tree which yields the corrupt fruits. If from an angel, what was the angel,
but the good work of God? If from man, what was even he, but the good work of God? Nay,
inasmuch as the corrupt will arose in the angel from an angel, and in man from man, what
were both these, previous to the evil arising within them, but the good work of God, with a
good and laudable nature? Behold, then, evil arises out of good; nor was there any other
source, indeed, whence it could arise, but out of good. I call that will bad which no evil has
preceded; no evil works, of course, since they only proceed from an evil will, as from a corrupt
tree. Nevertheless, that the evil will arose out of good, could not be, because that good was
made by the good God, but because it was created out of nothing—not out of God. What,
therefore, becomes of his argument, “If nature is the work of God, it will never do for the
work of the devil to permeate the work of God”? Did not the work of the devil, I ask, arise
in a work of God, when it first arose in that angel who became the devil? Well, then, if evil,
which was absolutely nowhere previously, could arise in a work of God, why could not evil,
which had by this time found an existence somewhere, pervade the work of God; especially
when the apostle uses the very expression in the passage, “And so death passed upon all
men”?2300 Can it be that men are not the work of God? Sin, therefore, has passed upon all
men—in other words, the devil’s work has penetrated the work of God; or putting the same
meaning in another shape, The work done by a work of God has pervaded God’s work. And
this is the reason why God alone has an unchangeable and almighty goodness: even before
any evil came into existence He made all things good; and out of all the evils which have
arisen in the good things which He has made, He works through all for good.</p>

<head>Chapter 49 <del>XXIX.</del>—In Infants Nature is of God, and the Corruption of Nature of
the Devil.</head>
<p>“In a single man rightly is the intention blamed and the origin praised; because there
must be two things to admit of contraries: in an infant, however, there is but one thing,
nature only; because will has no existence in his case. Now this one thing,” says he, “is
ascribable either to God or to the devil. If nature,” he goes on to observe, “is of God, there
cannot be original evil in it. If of the devil, there will be nothing on the ground of which
man may be vindicated for the work of God. So that he is completely a Manichean who
maintains original sin.” Let him hear rather what is true in opposition to all this. In a single
man the will is to be blamed, and his nature to be praised; because there should be two things
for the application of contraries. Still, even in an infant, it is not the case that there is but
one thing only, that is, the nature in which man was created by the good God; for he has
also that corruption, which has passed upon all men by one, as the apostle wisely says, and
not as the folly of Pelagius, or Coelestius, or any of their disciples would represent the matter.
Of these two things, then, which we have said exist in an infant, one is ascribed to God, the
other to the devil. From the fact, however, that (owing to one of the two, even the corruption)
both are subjected to the power of the devil, there really ensues no incongruity; because this
happens not from the power of the devil himself, but of God. In fact, corruption is subjected
to corruption, nature to nature, because the two are even in the devil; so that whenever those
who are beloved and elect are “delivered from the power of darkness”2301 to which they are
justly exposed, it is clear enough how great a gift is bestowed on the justified and good by
the good God, who brings good even out of evil.</p>

<head>Chapter 50.—The Rise and Origin of Evil. The Exorcism and Exsufflation of Infants,
a Primitive Christian Rite.</head>
<p>As to the passage, which he seemed to himself to indite in a pious vein, as it were, “If
nature is of God, there cannot be original sin in it,” would not another person seem even
to him to give a still more pious turn to it, thus: “If nature is of God, there cannot arise any
sin in it?” And yet this is not true. The Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they
endeavoured to steep in all sorts of evil the very nature of God itself, and not His creature,
made out of nothing. For evil arose in nothing else than what was good—not, however, the
supreme and unchangeable good which is God’s nature, but that which was made out of
nothing by the wisdom of God. This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine
work; for he would not be man unless he were made by the operation of God. But evil would
not exist in infants, if evil had not been committed by the wilfulness of the first man, and
original sin derived from a nature thus corrupted. It is not true, then, as he puts it, “He is
completely a Manichean who maintains original sin;” but rather, he is completely a Pelagian
who does not believe in original sin. For it is not simply from the time when the pestilent
opinions of Manichæus began to grow that in the Church of God infants about to be baptized
were for the first time exorcised with exsufflation,—which ceremonial was intended to show
that they were not removed into the kingdom of Christ without first being delivered from
the power of darkness;2302 nor is it in the books of Manichæus that we read how “the Son
of man come to seek and to save that which was lost,”2303 or how “by one man sin entered
into the world,”2304 with those other similar passages which we have quoted above; or how
God “visits the sins of the fathers upon the children;”2305 or how it is written in the Psalm,
“I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;”2306 or again, how “man
was made like unto vanity: his days pass away like a shadow;”2307 or again, “behold, Thou
hast made my days old, and my existence as nothing before Thee; nay, every man living is
altogether vanity;”2308 or how the apostle says, “every creature was made subject to vanity;”
2309 or how it is written in the book of Ecclesiastes, “vanity of vanities; all is vanity: what

Ecclesiasticus, “a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam from the day that they go out of their
mother’s womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things;”2311 or how again
the apostle writes, “in Adam all die;”2312 or how holy Job says, when speaking about his
own sins, “for man that is born of a woman is short-lived and full of wrath: as the flower of
grass, so does he fall; and he departs like a shadow, nor shall he stay. Hast Thou not taken
account even of him, and caused him to enter into judgment in Thy sight? For who shall be
pure from uncleanness? Not even one, even if his life should be but of one day upon the
earth.”2313 Now when he speaks of uncleanness here, the mere perusal of the passage is
enough to show that he meant sin to be understood. It is plain from the words, of what he
is speaking. The same phrase and sense occur in the prophet Zechariah, in the place where
“the filthy garments” are removed from off the high priest, and it is said to him, “I have
taken away thy sins.”2314 Well now, I rather think that all these passages, and others of like
import, which point to the fact that man is born in sin and under the curse, are not to be
read among the dark recesses of the Manicheans, but in the sunshine of catholic truth.</p>

Cyprian, and the Whole Church.</head>
<p>What, moreover, shall I say of those commentators on the divine Scriptures who have
flourished in the catholic Church? They have never tried to pervert these testimonies to an
alien sense, because they were firmly established in our most ancient and solid faith, and
were never moved aside by the novelty of error. Were I to wish to collect these together,
and to make use of their testimony, the task would both be too long, and I should probably
seem to have bestowed less preference than I ought on canonical authorities,2315 from which
one must never deviate. I will merely mention the most blessed Ambrose, to whom (as I
have already observed2316) Pelagius accorded so signal a testimony of his integrity in the
faith. This Ambrose, however, maintained that there was nothing else in infants, which required
the healing grace of Christ, than original sin.2317 But in respect of Cyprian, with his
all-glorious crown,2318 will any one say of him, that he either was, or ever could by any
possibility have been, a Manichean, when he suffered before the pestilent heresy had made
its appearance in the Roman world? And yet, in his book on the baptism of infants, he so
vigorously maintains original sin as to declare, that even before the eighth day, if necessary,
the infant ought to be baptized, lest his soul should be lost; and he wished it to be understood,
that the infant could the more readily attain to the indulgence of baptism, inasmuch as it is
not so much his own sins, but the sins of another, which are remitted to him. Well, then,
let this writer dare to call these Manicheans; let him, moreover, under this scandalous imputation
asperse that most ancient tradition of the Church, whereby infants are, as I have
said, exorcised with exsufflation, for the purpose of being translated into the kingdom of
Christ, after they are delivered from the power of darkness—that is to say, of the devil and
his angels. As for ourselves, indeed, we are more ready to be associated with these men, and
with the Church of Christ, so firmly rooted in this ancient faith, in suffering any amount of
curse and contumely, than with the Pelagians, to be covered with the flattery of public praise.</p>

<p>“Do you,” he asks, “repeat your affirmation, ‘There would be no concupiscence if man
had not first sinned; marriage, however, would have existed, even if no one had sinned’?” I
never said, “There would be no concupiscence,” because there is a concupiscence of the
spirit, which craves wisdom.2319 My words were, “There would be no shameful concupiscence.”
2320 Let my words be re-perused, even those which he has cited, that it may be clearly
seen how dishonestly they are handled by him. However, let him call it by any name he likes.
What I said would not have existed unless man had previously sinned, was that which made
them ashamed in paradise when they covered their loins, and which every one will allow
would not have been felt, had not the sin of disobedience first occurred. Now he who wishes
to understand what they felt, ought to consider what it was they covered. For of the figleaves
they made themselves “aprons,” not clothes; and these aprons or kilts are called
περιζώματα in Greek. Now all know well enough what it is which these peri-zomata cover,
which some Latin writers explain by the word campestria. Who is ignorant of what persons
wore this kilt, and what parts of the body such a dress concealed; even the same which the
Roman youths used to cover when they practised naked in the campus, from which circumstance
the name campester was given to the apron.2321</p>

when it says, ‘Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto
his wife, and they shall be one flesh,’2322 you pronounce to be diabolical evils, worthy, in
short, to be called a pest, not matrimony.” It is not to be wondered at, that these Pelagian
opponents of mine try to twist my words to any meaning they wish them to bear, when it
has been their custom to do the same thing with the Holy Scriptures, and not simply in obscure
passages, but where their testimony is clear and plain: a custom, indeed, which is followed
by all other heretics. Now who could make such an assertion, as that it was possible
for marriages to be “without bodily motion, without necessity for sexual organs”? For God
made the sexes; because, as it is written, “He created them male and female.”2323 But how
could it possibly happen, that they who were to be united together, and by the very union
were to beget children, were not to move their bodies, when, of course, there can be no
bodily contact of one person with another if bodily motion be not resorted to? The question
before us, then, is not about the motion of bodies, without which there could not be sexual
intercourse; but about the shameful motion of the organs of generation, which certainly
could be absent, and yet the fructifying connection be still not wanting, if the organs of
generation were not obedient to lust, but simply to the will, like the other members of the
body. Is it not even now the case, in “the body of this death,” that a command is given to
the foot, the arm, the finger, the lip, or the tongue, and they are instantly set in motion at
this intimation of our will? And (to take a still more wonderful case) even the liquid contained
in the urinary vessels obeys the command to flow from us at our pleasure, and when we are
not pressed with its overflow; while the vessels, also, which contain the liquid, discharge
without difficulty, if they are in a healthy state, the office assigned them by our will of propelling,
pressing out, and ejecting their contents. With how much greater ease and quietness,
then, if the generative organs of our body were compliant, would natural motion ensue, and
human conception be effected; except in the instance of those persons who violate natural
order, and by a righteous retribution are punished with the intractability of these members
and organs! This punishment is felt by the chaste and pure, who, without doubt, would
rather beget children by mere natural desire than by voluptuous pruriency; while unchaste
persons, who are impelled by this diseased passion, and bestow their love upon harlots as

<head>Chapter 54 <del>XXXII.</del>—How Marriage is Now Different Since the Existence of Sin.</head>
<p>God forbid that we should say, what this man pretends we say, “Such marriages as are
now enacted are the invention of the devil.” Why, they are absolutely the same marriages
as God made at the very first. For this blessing of His, which He appointed for the procreation
of mankind, He has not taken away even from men under condemnation, any more than
He has deprived them of their senses and bodily limbs, which are no doubt His gifts, although
they are condemned to die by an already incurred retribution. This, I say, is the marriage
whereof it was said (only excepting the great sacrament of Christ and the Church, which
the institution prefigured): “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
shall cleave unto his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh.”2324 For this, no doubt, was
said before sin; and if no one had sinned, it might have been done without shameful lust.
And now, although it is not done without that, in the body of this death, there is that nevertheless
which does not cease to be done so that a man may cleave to his wife, and they twain
be one flesh. When, therefore, it is alleged that marriage is now one thing, but might have
been another had no one sinned, this is not predicated of its nature, but of a certain quality
which has undergone a change for the worse. Just as a man is said to be different, though
he is actually the same individual, when he has changed his manner of life either for the
better or the worse; for as a righteous man he is one thing, and as a sinful man another,
though the man himself be really the same individual. In like manner, marriage without
shameful lust is one thing, and marriage with shameful lust is another. When, however, a
woman is lawfully united to her husband in accordance with the true constitution of wedlock,
and fidelity to what is due to the flesh is kept free from the sin of adultery, and so children
are lawfully begotten, it is actually the very same marriage which God instituted at first, although
by his primeval inducement to sin, the devil inflicted a heavy wound, not, indeed,
on marriage itself, but on man and woman by whom marriage is made, by his prevailing
on them to disobey God,—a sin which is requited in the course of the divine judgment by
the reciprocal disobedience of man’s own members. United in this matrimonial state, al-
though they were ashamed of their nakedness, still they were not by any means able altogether
to lose the blessedness of marriage which God appointed.</p>

Sense.</head>
<p>He then passes on from those who are united in marriage to those who are born of it.
It is in relation to these that we have to encounter the most laborious discussions with the
new heretics in connection with our subject. Impelled by some hidden instinct from God,
he makes avowals which go far to untie the whole knot. For in his desire to raise greater
odium against us, because we had said that infants are born in sin even of lawful wedlock,
he makes the following observation: “You assert that they, indeed, who have not been ever
born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the world, and for
whom Christ died, you decide to be the work of the devil, born in a disordered state, and
guilty from the beginning. Therefore,” he continues, “I have shown that you are doing
nothing else than denying that God is the Creator of the men who actually exist.” I beg to
say, that I declare none but God to be the Creator of all men, however true it be that all are
born in sin, and must perish unless born again. It was, indeed, the sinful corruption which
had been sown in them by the devil’s persuasion that became the means of their being born
in sin; not the created nature of which men are composed. Shameful lust, however, could
not excite our members, except at our own will, if it were not a disease. Nor would even the
lawful and honourable cohabiting of husband and wife raise a blush, with avoidance of any
eye and desire of secrecy, if there were not a diseased condition about it. Moreover, the
apostle would not prohibit the possession of wives in this disease, did not disease exist in
it. The phrase in the Greek text, ἐν πάθει ἐπιθυμίας, is by some rendered in Latin, in morbo
desiderii vel concupiscentiæ, in the disease of desire or of concupiscence; by others, however,
in passione concupiscentiæ, in the passion of concupiscence; or however it is found otherwise
in different copies: at any rate, the Latin equivalent passio (passion), especially in the ecclesiastical
use, is usually understood as a term of censure.</p>

<head>Chapter 56.—The Pelagians Allow that Christ Died Even for Infants; Julianus Slays
Himself with His Own Sword.</head>
<p>But whatever opinion he may entertain about the shame-causing concupiscence of the
flesh, I must request your attention to what he has said respecting infants (and it is in their
behalf that we labour), as to their being supposed to need a Saviour, if they are not to die
without salvation. I repeat his words once more: “You assert,” says he to me, “that they, indeed,
who have not been ever born might possibly have been good; those, however, who
have peopled the world, and for whom Christ died, you decide to be the work of the devil,
born in a disordered state, and guilty from the very beginning.” Would that he only solved
the entire controversy as he unties the knot of this question! For will he pretend to say that
he merely spoke of adults in this passage? Why, the subject in hand is about infants, about
human beings at their birth; and it is about these that he raises odium against us, because
they are defined by us as guilty from the very first, because we declare them to be guilty,
since Christ died for them. And why did Christ die for them if they are not guilty? It is entirely
from them, yes, from them, we shall find the reason, wherefore he thought odium should
be raised against me. He asks: “How are infants guilty, for whom Christ died?” We answer:
Nay, how are infants not guilty, since Christ died for them? This dispute wants a judge to
determine it. Let Christ be the Judge, and let Him tell us what is the object which has profited
by His death? “This is my blood,” He says, “which shall be shed2325 for many for the remission
of sins.”2326 Let the apostle, too, be His assessor in the judgment; since even in the
apostle it is Christ Himself that speaks. Speaking of God the Father, he exclaims: “He who
spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all!”2327 I suppose that he describes
Christ as so delivered up for us all, that infants in this matter are not separated from ourselves.
But what need is there to dwell on this point, out of which even he no longer raises a contest?
For the truth is, he not only confesses that Christ died even for infants, but he also reproves
us out of this admission, because we say that these same infants are guilty for whom Christ
died. Now, then, let the apostle, who says that Christ was delivered up for us all, also tell us
why Christ was delivered up for us. “He was delivered,” says he, “for our offences, and rose
again for our justification.”2328 If, therefore, as even this man both confesses and professes,
both admits and objects, infants, too, are included amongst those for whom Christ was delivered
up; and if it was for our sins that Christ was delivered up, even infants, of course,
must have original sins, for whom Christ was delivered up; He must have something in
them to heal, who (as Himself affirms) is not needed as a Physician by the whole, but by the

Apostle Paul says, “to save sinners;”2330 He must have something in them to remit, who
testifies that He shed His blood “for the remission of sins;”2331 He must have good reason
for seeking them out, who “came,” as He says, “to seek and to save that which was lost;”2332
the Son of man must find in them something to destroy, who came for the express purpose,
as the Apostle John says, “that He might destroy the works of the devil.”2333 Now to this
salvation of infants He must be an enemy, who asserts their innocence, in such a way as to
deny them the medicine which is required by the hurt and wounded.</p>

<head>Chapter 57 <del>XXXIV.</del>—The Great Sin of the First Man.</head>
<p>Now observe what follows, as he goes on to say: “If, before sin, God created a source
from which men should be born, but the devil a source from which parents were disturbed,
then beyond a doubt holiness must be ascribed to those that are born, and guilt to those
that produce. Since, however, this would be a most manifest condemnation of marriage;
remove, I pray you, this view from the midst of the churches, and really believe that all things
were made by Jesus Christ, and that without Him nothing was made.”2334 He so speaks
here, as if he would make us say, that there is a something in man’s substance which was
created by the devil. The devil persuaded evil as a sin; he did not create it as a nature. No
doubt he persuaded nature for man is nature; and therefore by his persuasion he corrupted
it. He who wounds a limb does not, of course, create it, but he injures it.2335 Those wounds,
indeed, which are inflicted on the body produce lameness in a limb, or difficulty of motion;
but they do not affect the virtue whereby a man becomes righteous: that wound, however,
which has the name of sin, wounds the very life, which was being righteously lived. This
wound was at that fatal moment of the fall inflicted by the devil to a vastly wider and deeper
extent than are the sins which are known amongst men. Whence it came to pass, that our
nature having then and there been deteriorated by that great sin of the first man, not only
was made a sinner, but also generates sinners; and yet the very weakness, under which the
virtue of a holy life has drooped and died, is not really nature, but corruption; precisely as
a bad state of health is not a bodily substance or nature, but disorder; very often, indeed, if
not always, the ailing character of parents is in a certain way implanted, and reappears in
the bodies of their children.</p>

<head>Chapter 58.—Adam’s Sin is Derived from Him to Every One Who is Born Even of
Regenerate Parents; The Example of the Olive Tree and the Wild Olive.</head>
<p>But this sin, which changed man for the worse in paradise, because it is far greater than
we can form any judgment of, is contracted by every one at his birth, and is remitted only
in the regenerate; and this derangement is such as to be derived even from parents who have
been regenerated, and in whom the sin is remitted and covered, to the condemnation of the
children born of them, unless these, who were bound by their first and carnal birth, are absolved
by their second and spiritual birth. Of this wonderful fact the Creator has produced
a wonderful example in the cases of the olive and the wild olive trees, in which, from the
seed not only of the wild olive, but even of the good olive, nothing but a wild olive springs.
Wherefore, although even in persons whose natural birth is followed by regeneration through
grace, there exists this carnal concupiscence which contends against the law of the mind,
yet, seeing that it is remitted in the remission of sins, it is no longer accounted to them as
sin, nor is it in any degree hurtful, unless consent is yielded to its motions for unlawful
deeds. Their offspring, however, being begotten not of spiritual concupiscence, but of carnal,
like a wild olive of our race from the good olive, derives guilt from them by natural birth to
such a degree that it cannot be liberated from that pest except by being born again. How is
it, then, that this man affirms that we ascribe holiness to those who are born, and guilt to
their parents? when the truth rather shows that even if there has been holiness in the parents,
original sin is inherent in their children, which is abolished in them only if they are born
again.</p>

<head>Chapter 59 <del>XXXV.</del>—The Pelagians Can Hardly Venture to Place Concupiscence
in Paradise Before the Commission of Sin.</head>
<p>This being the case, let him think what he pleases about this concupiscence of the flesh
and about the lust which lords it over the unchaste, has to be mastered by the chaste, and
yet is to be blushed at both by the chaste and the unchaste; for I see plainly he is much
pleased with it. Let him not hesitate to praise what he is ashamed to name; let him call it (as
he has in fact called it) the vigour of the members, and let him not be afraid of the honor of
chaste ears; let him designate it the power of the members, and let him not care about the
impudence. Let him say, if his blushes permit him, that if no one had sinned, this vigour
must have flourished like a flower in paradise; nor would there have been any need to cover
that which would have been so moved that no one should have felt ashamed; rather, with
a wife provided, it would have been ever exercised and never repressed, lest so great a
pleasure should ever be denied to so vast a happiness. Far be it from being thought that such
blessedness could in such a spot fail to have what it wished, or ever experience in mind or
body what it disliked. And so, should the motion of lust precede men’s will, then the will
would immediately follow it. The wife, who ought certainly never to be absent in this happy
state of things, would be urged on by it, whether about to conceive or already pregnant; and,
either a child would be begotten, or a natural and laudable pleasure would be gratified,—for
perish all seed rather than disappoint the appetite of so good a concupiscence. Only be sure
that the united pair do not apply themselves to that use of each other which is contrary to
nature, then (with so modest a reservation) let them use, as often as they would have delight,
their organs of generation, created for the purpose. But what if this very use, which is contrary
to nature, should peradventure give them delight; what if the aforesaid laudable lust should
hanker even after such delight; I wonder whether they should pursue it because it was sweet,
or loathe it because it was base? If they should pursue it to gratification, what becomes of
all thought about honour? If they should loathe it, where is the peaceful composure of so
good a happiness? But at this point perchance his blushes will awake, and he will say that
so great is the tranquillity of this happy state, and so entire the orderliness which may have
existed in this state of things, that carnal concupiscence never preceded these persons’ will:
only whenever they themselves wished, would it then arise; and only then would they entertain
the wish, when there was need for begetting children; and the result would be, that no
seed would ever be emitted to no purpose, nor would any embrace ever ensue which would
not be followed by conception and birth; the flesh would obey the will, and concupiscence
would vie with it in subserviency. Well, if he says all this of the imagined happy state, he
must at least be pretty sure that what he describes does not now exist among men. And even
if he will not concede that lust is a corrupt condition, let him at least allow that through the
disobedience of the man and woman in the happy state the very concupiscence of their flesh
was corrupted, so that what would once be excited obediently and orderly is now moved

<pb n="884"/>
disobediently and inordinately, and that to such a degree that it is not obedient to the will
of even chaste-minded husbands and wives, so that it is excited when it is not wanted; and
whenever it is necessary, it never, indeed, follows their will, but sometimes too hurriedly,
at other times too tardily, exerts its own movements. Such, then, is the rebellion of this
concupiscence which the primitive pair received for their own disobedience, and transfused
by natural descent to us. It certainly was not at their bidding, but in utter disorder, that it
was excited, when they covered their members, which at first were worthy to be gloried in,
but had then become a ground of shame.</p>

it as he pleases, praise it as much as he chooses (and he pleases much, as several of his extracts
show), that the Pelagians may gratify themselves, if not with its uses, at all events with its
praises, as many of them as fail to enjoy the limitation of continence enjoined in wedlock.
Only let him spare the infants, so as not to praise their condition uselessly, and defend them

Pelagius for eulogy, but to Christ for salvation. For, that this book may be now brought to
a termination, since the dissertation of this man is ended, which was written on the short
paper you sent me, I will close with his last words: “Really believe that all things were made
by Jesus Christ, and that without Him nothing was made.”2336 Let him grant that Jesus is
Jesus even to infants; and as he confesses that all things were made by Him, in that He is
God the Word, so let him acknowledge that infants, too, are saved by Him in that He is Jesus;
let him, I say, do this if he would be a catholic Christian. For thus it is written in the Gospel:
“And they shall call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins”2337—Jesus,
because Jesus is in Latin Salvator, “Saviour.” He shall, indeed, save His people; and amongst
His people surely there are infants. “From their sins” shall He save them; in infants, too,
therefore, are there original sins, on account of which He can be Jesus, that is, Saviour, even
unto them.</p>

<head>EXTRACT FROM AUGUSTIN’S “RETRACTATIONS,”
Book II. Chap. 56,
ON THE FOLLOWING TREATISE,
“DE ANIMA ET EJUS ORIGINE.”</head>
<p>“At that time one Vincentius discovered in the possesion of a certain presbyter called
Peter, in Mauritania Cæsariensis, a little work of mine, in a particular passage of which,
touching the origin of souls in individual men, I had confessed that I knew not whether they
are propagated from the primeval soul of the first man, and from that by parental descent,
or whether they are severally assigned to each person without propogation, as the first was
to Adam; but that I was, at the same time, quite sure that the soul was not body, but spirit.
In opposition to these opinions of mine, he addressed to this Peter two books, which were
sent to me from Cæsarea by the monk Renatus. Having read these books, I replied in four
others,—one addressed to the monk Renatus, another to the presbyter Peter, and two more
to Victor himself. That to Peter, however, though it has all the lengthiness of a book, is yet
only a letter, which I did not like to be kept separate from the other three works. In all of
them, while discussing many points which were unavoidable, I defended my hesitancy on
the point of the origin of the souls which are given to individual men; and I pointed out this
man’s many errors and presumptuous pravity. At the same time, I treated the young man
as gently as I could,—not as one who ought to be denounced all out of hand, but as one who
ought to be still instructed; and I accepted the account of his conduct which he wrote back
to me. In this work of mine, the book addressed to Renatus begins with these words: “Your
sincerity towards us;” while that which was written to Peter begins thus: “To his Lordship,
my dearly beloved brother and co-presbyter Peter.” Of the last two books, which are addressed
to Vincentius Victor, the former one thus opens: “As to that which I have thought it my
duty to write to you.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<pb n="888"/>
<head>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER ON THE FOLLOWING
TREATISE.</head>
<p>The occasion of these four books was furnished by a young man named Vincentius
Victor, a native of Mauritania Cæsariensis, a convert to the catholic Church from the
Rogatian faction (which split off from the Donatist schism, and inhabited that part of
Mauritania which lay around Cartenna). This Victor, they say, had previously so high an
opinion of the Vincentius who succeeded Rogatus as the head of the before-mentioned
faction, that he adopted his name as his own.2338 Happening to meet with a certain work
of Augustin’s, in which the writer acknowledged himself to be incapable of saying whether
all souls were propagated from Adam’s soul simply, or whether every man severally had his
soul given to him by God, even as Adam himself had, without propagation, although he
declared, for all that, his conviction that the soul was in its nature spirit, not body, Victor
was equally offended with both statements: he wondered that so great a man as Augustin
did not unhesitatingly teach what one ought to hold concerning the origin of the soul, especially
as he thought its propagation probable; and also that he did state with so great assurance
the nature of the soul to be incorporeal. He accordingly published two books written to one
Peter, a presbyter of Spain, against Augustin on this subject, containing some conceits of
the Pelagian heretics, and other things even worse than these.2339</p>
<p>A monk called Renatus happened then to be at Cæsarea. It appears that this man had
shown to Augustin, who was staying at the same place in the autumn of the year 418, a letter
of the Bishop Optatus consulting him about the origin of the soul.2340 This monk, of the
order of laymen, but perfectly orthodox in the faith, induced by the circumstance, carefully
copied the books of Victor, and forwarded them from Cæsarea to Hippo the next summer;
Augustin, however, only received them at the end of autumn of the year 419, as is supposed.
As soon as the holy doctor read them, he without delay wrote the first of the four following
books to the good monk, and then the second, in the shape of a letter, to the presbyter Peter,
and the two last books to Victor himself, but after a considerable interval, as it appears from
the following words of the fourth chapter of the second book: “If, indeed, the Lord will that
I should write to the young man, as I desire to do.” In the Retractations this little work of
Augustin is placed immediately after the treatises of the year 419, i.e. in the fifth place after
the Proceedings with Emeritus, which were completed in the month of September in the year
418. It belongs, therefore, to the termination of the year 419 or to the commencement of

the year 420, having been written after “the condemnation of the Pelagians by the authority
of catholic Councils and of the Apostolic See,”2341 but “very soon after,”2342 as that happy
event had happened in the year of Christ 418.</p>
<p>In Book I., written to Renatus, he points out his own opinion about the nature of the
soul, and his hesitation as to its origin, which had been unjustly blamed by Victor. He reproves
the man’s juvenile forwardness, shows him he had fallen into grave and unheard-of
errors while venturing to take upon himself the solution of a question which exceeded his
abilities, and points out that he adduced only doubtful passages of Scripture, and such as
were not applicable to the subject, in his endeavour to prove that souls are not propagated,
but that entirely new ones are breathed by God into every man at his separate birth.</p>
<p>In Book II., he advises Peter not to incur the imputation of having approved of the books
which had been addressed to him by Victor On the Origin of the Soul by any use he might
make of them, nor to take as catholic doctrines that person’s rash utterances contrary to the
Christian faith. Victor’s various and very serious errors he points out and briefly confutes,
and he concludes with advising Peter himself to try to persuade Victor to correct his errors.</p>
<p>In Book III., which was written to Victor himself, he points out the corrections which
Victor ought to make in his books if he wished to be deemed a catholic; those opinions also
and paradoxes of his, which had been already refuted in the preceding books to Renatus
and Peter, the author briefly censures in this third book, and classifies under eleven heads
of error.</p>
<p>In Book IV., addressed to the same Victor, he first shows that his hesitation on the
subject of the origin of souls was undeservedly blamed, and that he was wrongly compared
with cattle, because he had refrained from any bold conclusions on the subject. Then again,
with regard to his own unhesitating statement, that the soul was spirit, not body, he points
out how rashly Victor disapproved of this assertion, especially when he was vainly expending
his efforts to prove that the soul was corporeal in its own nature, and that the spirit in man
was distinct from the soul itself.</p>

<p>ADDRESSED TO RENATUS, THE MONK.</p>
<p>On receiving from Renatus the two books of Vincentius Victor, who disapproved of Augustin’s
opinion touching the nature of the soul, and of his hesitation in respect of its origin, Augustin
points out how the young objector, in his self-conceit in aiming to decide on so abstruse
a subject, had fallen into insufferable mistakes. He then proceeds to show that those
passages of Scripture by which Victor thought he could prove that human souls are not
derived by propagation, but are breathed by God afresh into each man at birth, are ambiguous,
and inadequate for the confirmation of this opinion of his.</p>

<p>Your sincerity towards us, dearest brother Renatus, and your brotherly kindness, and
the affection of mutual love between us, we already had clear proof of; but now you have
afforded us a still clearer proof, by sending me two books, written by a person whom I knew,
indeed, nothing of,—though he was not on that account to be despised,—called Vincentius
Victor (for in such form did I find his name placed at the head of his work): this you did in
the summer of last year; but owing to my absence from home, it was the end of autumn
before they found their way to me. How, indeed, would you be likely with your very great
affection for me to fail either in means or inclination to bring under my notice any writings
of the kind, by whomsoever composed, if they fell into your hands, even if they were addressed
to some one else? How much less likely, when my own name was mentioned and
read—and that in a context of gainsaying some words of mine, which I had published in
certain little treatises? Now you have done all this in the way you were sure to act as my very
sincere and beloved friend.</p>

and Inexperienced Man Who Wrote Against Him in a Tone of Arrogance.
Vincentius Victor Converted from the Sect of the Rogatians.</head>
<p>I am somewhat pained, however, at being thus far less understood by your Holiness
than I should like to be; forasmuch as you supposed that I should so receive your communication,
as if you did me an injury, by making known to me what another had done. You
may see, indeed, how far this feeling is from my mind, in that I have no complaint to make
of having suffered any wrong even from him. For, when he entertained views different from
my own, was he bound to preserve silence? It ought, no doubt, to be even pleasant to me,
that he broke silence in such a way as to put it in our power to read what he had to say. He
ought, I certainly think, to have written simply to me, rather than to another concerning
me; but as he was unknown to me, he did not venture to intrude personally on me in refuting
my words. He thought there was no necessity for applying to me in a matter on which he
seemed to himself least of all liable to be doubted, 2344 but to be holding a perfectly wellknown
and certain opinion. He moreover, acted in obedience to a friend of his by whom
he tells us he was compelled to write. And if he expressed any sentiment during the controversy
which was contumelious to me, I would prefer supposing that he did this, not with
any wish to treat me with incivility, but from the necessity of thinking differently from me.
For in all cases where a person’s animus towards one is indeterminate and unknown, I think
it better to suppose the existence of the kindlier motive, than to find fault with an undiscovered
one. Perhaps, too, he acted from love to me, as knowing that what he had written
might possibly reach me; being at the same time unwilling that I should be in error on such
points as he especially thinks himself to be free from error regarding. I ought, therefore, to
be grateful for his kindness, although I feel obliged to disapprove of his opinion. Accordingly,
as regards the points on which he does not entertain right views, he appears to me to deserve
gentle correction rather than severe disapproval; more especially because, if I am rightly
informed, he has lately become a catholic—a matter in which he is to be congratulated. For
he has freed himself from the schism and errors of the Donatists (or rather the Rogatists)
in which he was previously implicated; and if he understands the catholic verity as he ought,
we may really rejoice at his conversion.</p>

<p>For he has an eloquence by which he is able to explain what he thinks. He must, therefore,
be dealt with accordingly; and we must hope that he may entertain right sentiments, and
that he may not turn useless things into objects of desire; that he may not seem to have
propounded as true whatever he may have expressed with eloquence. But in his very outspokenness
he may have much to correct, and to prune of redundant verbiage. And this
characteristic of his has actually given offence to you, who are a person of gravity, as your
own writings indicate. This fault, however, is either easily corrected, or, if it be resorted to
with fondness by light minds, and borne with by serious ones, it is not attended with any
injury to their faith. For we have already amongst us men who are frothy in speech, but
sound in the faith. We need not then despair that this quality even in him (it might be endurable,
however, even if it proved permanent) may be tempered and cleansed—in fact,
may be either extended or recalled to an entire and solid criterion; especially as he is said
to be young, so that diligence may supply to him whatever defect his inexperience may
possess, and ripeness of age may digest what crude loquacity finds indigestible. The
troublesome, dangerous, and pernicious thing is, when folly is set off by the commendation

<head>Chapter 4 <del>IV.</del>—The Errors Contained in the Books of Vincentius Victor. He Says
that the Soul Comes from God, But Was Not Made Either Out of Nothing or
Out of Any Created Thing.</head>
<p>I will now proceed to point out what things are chiefly to be avoided in his contentious
statement. He says that the soul was made, indeed, by God, but that it is not a portion of
God or of the nature of God,—which is an entirely true statement. When, however, he refuses
to allow that it is made out of nothing, and mentions no other created thing out of which
it was made; and makes God its author, in such a sense that He must be supposed to have
made it, neither out of any non-existing things, that is, out of nothing, nor out of anything
which exists other than God, but out of His very self: he is little aware that in the revolution
of his thoughts he has come back to the position which he thinks he has avoided, even that
the soul is nothing else than the nature of God; and consequently that there is an actual
something made out of the nature of God by the self-same God, for the making of which
the material of which He makes it is His own very self who makes it; and that thus God’s
nature is changeable, and by being changed for the worse the very nature of God Himself
incurs condemnation at the hands of the self-same God! How far all this is from being fit
for your intelligent faith to suppose, how alien it is from the heart of a catholic, and how
much to be avoided, you can readily see. For the soul is either so made out of the breath, or
God’s breath is so made into it, that it was not created out of Himself, but by Himself out
of nothing. It is not, indeed, like the case of a human being, when he breathes: he cannot
form a breath out of nothing, but he restores to the air the breath which he inhaled out of
it. We may in some such manner suppose that certain airs surrounded the Divine Being,
and that He inhaled a particle of it by breathing, and exhaled it again by respiration, when
He breathed into man’s face, and so formed for him a soul. If this were the process, it could
not have been out of His very self, but out of the circumambient airy matter, that what He
breathed forth must have arisen. Far be it, however, from us to say, that the Almighty could
not have made the breath of life out of nothing, by which man might become a living soul;
and to crowd ourselves into such straits, as that we must either think that something already
existed other than Himself, out of which He formed breath, or else suppose that He formed
out of Himself that which we see was made subject to change. Now, whatever is out of
Himself, must necessarily be of the self-same nature as Himself, and therefore immutable:
but the soul (as all allow) is mutable. Therefore it is not out of Him, because it is not immutable,
as He is. If, however, it was not made of anything else, it was undoubtedly made out
of nothing—but by Himself.</p>

<head>Chapter 5 <del>V.</del>—Another of Victor’s Errors, that the Soul is Corporeal.</head>
<p>But as regards his contention, “that the soul is not spirit, but body,” what else can he
mean to make out, than that we are composed, not of soul and body, but of two or even
three bodies? For inasmuch as he says that we consist of spirit, soul and body, and asserts
that all the three are bodies; it follows, that he supposes us to be made up of three bodies.
How absurd this conclusion is, I think ought rather to be demonstrated to him than to you.
But this is not an intolerable error on the part of a person who has not yet discovered that
there is in existence a something, which, though it be not corporeal, yet may wear somewhat
of the similitude of a body.</p>

<head>Chapter 6 <del>VI.</del>—Another Error Out of His Second Book, to the Effect, that the Soul
Deserved to Be Polluted by the Body.</head>
<p>But he is plainly past endurance in what he says in his second book, when he endeavours
to solve a very difficult question on original sin, how it belongs to body and soul, if the soul
is not derived by parental descent but is breathed afresh by God into a man. Striving to explain
this troublesome and profound point, he thus expresses his view: “Through the flesh
the soul fitly recovers its primitive condition, which it seemed to have gradually lost through
the flesh, in order that it may begin to be regenerated by the very flesh by which it had deserved
to be polluted.” You observe how this person, having been so bold as to undertake
what exceeds his powers, has fallen down such a precipice as to say, that the soul deserved
to be defiled by the body; although he could in no wise declare whence it drew on itself this
desert, before it put on flesh. For if it first had from the flesh its desert of sin, let him tell us
(if he can) whence (previous to sin) it derived its desert to be contaminated by the flesh. For
this desert, which projected it into sinful flesh to be polluted by it, it of course had either
from itself, or, which is much more offensive to our mind, from God. It certainly could not,
previous to its being invested with the flesh, have received from that flesh that ill desert by
reason of which it was projected into the flesh, in order to be defiled by it. Now, if it had the
ill desert from its own self, how did it get it, seeing that it did no sin previous to its assumption
of flesh? But if it be alleged that it had the ill desert from God, then, I ask, who could listen
to such blasphemy? Who could endure it? Who could permit it to be alleged with impunity?
For the question which arises here, remember, is not, what was the ill desert which adjudged
the soul to be condemned after it became incarnate, but what was its ill desert prior to the
flesh, which condemned it to the investiture of the flesh, that it might be thereby polluted?
Let him explain this to us, if he can, seeing that he has dared to say that the soul deserved
to be defiled by the flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>VII.</del>—Victor Entangles Himself in an Exceedingly Difficult Question.
God’s Foreknowledge is No Cause of Sin.</head>
<p>In another passage, also, on proposing for explanation the very same question in which
he had entangled himself, he says, speaking in the person of certain objectors: “Why, they
ask, did God inflict upon the soul so unjust a punishment as to be willing to relegate it into
a body, when, by reason of its association with the flesh, that begins to be sinful which could
not have been sinful?” Now, amidst the reefy sea of such a question, it was surely his duty
to beware of shipwreck; nor to commit himself to dangers which he could not hope to escape
by passing over them, and where his only chance of safety lay in putting back again—in a
word, by repentance. He tries to free himself by means of the foreknowledge of God, but to
no purpose. For God’s foreknowledge only marks beforehand those sinners whom He pur-
poses to heal. For if He liberates from sin those souls which He Himself involved in sin when
innocent and pure, He then heals a wound which Himself inflicted on us, not which He
found in us. May God, however, forbid it, and may it be altogether far from us to say, that
when God cleanses the souls of infants by the laver of regeneration, He then corrects evils
which He Himself made for them, when He commingled them, which had no sin before,
with sinful flesh, that they might be contaminated by its original sin. As regards, however,
the souls which this calumniator alleges to have deserved pollution by the flesh, he is quite
unable to tell us how it is they deserved so vast an evil, previous to their connection with
the flesh.</p>

<pb n="898"/>
<head>Chapter 8 <del>VIII.</del>—Victor’s Erroneous Opinion, that the Soul Deserved to Become
Sinful.</head>
<p>Vainly supposing, then, that he was able to solve this question from the foreknowledge
of God, he keeps floundering on, and says: “If the soul deserved to be sinful which could
not have been sinful, yet neither did it remain in sin, because, as prefigured in Christ, it was
not bound to be in sin, even as it was unable to be.” Now what can he mean when he says,
“which could not have been sinful,” or “was unable to be in sin,” except, as I suppose, this,
if it did not come into the flesh? For, of course, it could not have been sinful through original
sin, or have been at all involved in original sin, except through the flesh, if it is not derived
from the parent. We see it, then, liberated from sin through grace, but we do not see how
it deserved to be involved in sin. What, then, is the meaning of these words of his, “If the
soul deserved to be sinful, yet neither did it remain in sin”? For if I were to ask him, why it
did not remain in sin, he would very properly answer, Because the grace of Christ delivered
it therefrom. Since, then, he tells us how it came to pass that an infant’s soul was liberated
from its sinfulness, let him further tell us how it happened that it deserved to be sinful.

<pb n="899"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—Victor Utterly Unable to Explain How the Sinless Soul Deserved to Be
Made Sinful.</head>
<p>But what does he mean by that, which in his introduction he says has befallen him? For
previous to proposing that question of his, and as introducing it, he affirms: “There are
other opprobrious expressions underlying the querulous murmurings of those who rail at
us; and, shaken about as in a hurricane, we are again and again dashed amongst enormous
rocks.” Now, if I were to express myself about him in this style, he would probably be angry.
The words are his; and after premising them, he propounded his question, by way of
showing us the very rocks against which he struck and was wrecked. For to such lengths
was he carried, and against such frightful reefs was he borne, drifted, and struck, that his
escape was a perfect impossibility without a retreat—a correction, in short, of what he had
said; since he was unable to show by what desert the soul was made sinful; though he was
not afraid to say, that previous to any sin of its own it had deserved to become sinful. Now,
who deserves, without committing any sin, so immense a punishment as to be conceived
in the sin of another, before leaving his mother’s womb, and then to be no longer free from
sin? But from this punishment the free grace of God delivers the souls of such infants as are
regenerated in Christ, with no previous merits of their own—otherwise grace is no grace.”2345
With regard, then, to this person, who is so vastly intelligent, and who in the great depth of
his wisdom is displeased at our hesitation, which, if not well informed, is at all events circumspect,
let him tell us, if he can, what the merit was which brought the soul into such a
punishment, from which grace delivers it without any merit. Let him speak, and, if he can,
defend his assertion with some show of reason. I would not, indeed, require so much of
him, if he had not himself declared that the soul deserved to become sinful. Let him tell us
what the desert was—whether good desert or evil? If good, how could well-deserving lead
to evil? If evil, whence could arise any ill desert previous to the commission of any sin? I
have also to remark, that if there be a good desert, then the liberation of the soul would not
be of free grace, but it would be due to the previous merit, and thus “grace would be no
more grace.” If there be, however, an evil desert, then I ask what it is. Is it true that the soul
has come into the flesh; and that it would not have so come unless He in whom there is no
sin had Himself sent it? Never, therefore, except by floundering worse and worse, will he
contrive to set up this view of his, in which he predicates of the soul that it deserved to be
sinful. In the case of those infants, too, in whose baptism original sin is washed away, he
found something to say after a fashion,—to the effect, that being involved in the sin of another
could not possibly have been detrimental to them, predestinated as they were to
eternal life in the foreknowledge of God. This might admit of a tolerably good sense, if he
had not entangled himself in that formula of his, in which he asserts that the soul deserved
<note type="footnote">2345 Rom. xi. 6.</note>

<p>But when he wished to answer with respect, however, to those infants who are prevented
by death from being first baptized in Christ, he was so bold as to promise them not only
paradise, but also the kingdom of heaven,—finding no way else of avoiding the necessity of
saying that God condemns to eternal death innocent souls which, without any previous
desert of sin, He introduces into sinful flesh. He saw, however, to some extent what evil he
was giving utterance to, in implying that without any grace of Christ the souls of infants are
redeemed to everlasting life and the kingdom of heaven, and that in their case original sin
may be cancelled without Christ’s baptism, in which is effected the forgiveness of sins: observing
all this, and into what a depth he had plunged in his sea of shipwreck, he says, “I am
of opinion that for them, indeed, constant oblations and sacrifices must be continually
offered up by holy priests.” You may here behold another danger, out of which he will
never escape except by regret and a recall of his words. For who can offer up the body of
Christ for any except for those who are members of Christ? Moreover, from the time when
He said, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
of heaven;”2346 and again, “He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it;”2347 no one becomes
a member of Christ except it be either by baptism in Christ, or death for Christ.2348</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Martyrdom for Christ Supplies the Place of Baptism. The Faith of the
Thief Who Was Crucified Along with Christ Taken as Martyrdom and Hence
for Baptism.</head>
<p>Accordingly, the thief, who was no follower of the Lord previous to the cross, but His
confessor upon the cross, from whose case a presumption is sometimes taken, or attempted,
against the sacrament of baptism, is reckoned by St. Cyprian2349 among the martyrs who
are baptized in their own blood, as happens to many unbaptized persons in times of hot
persecution. For to the fact that he confessed the crucified Lord so much weight is attributed
and so much availing value assigned by Him who knows how to weigh and value such
evidence, as if he had been crucified for the Lord. Then, indeed, his faith on the cross
flourished when that of the disciples failed, and that without recovery if it had not bloomed
again by the resurrection of Him before the terror of whose death it had drooped. They
despaired of Him when dying,—he hoped when joined with Him in dying; they fled from
the author of life,—he prayed to his companion in punishment; they grieved as for the death
of a man,—he believed that after death He was to be a king; they forsook the sponsor of
their salvation,—he honoured the companion of His cross. There was discovered in him
the full measure of a martyr, who then believed in Christ when they fell away who were
destined to be martyrs. All this, indeed, was manifest to the eyes of the Lord, who at once
bestowed so great felicity on one who, though not baptized, was yet washed clean in the
blood, as it were, of martyrdom. But even of ourselves, who cannot reflect with how much
faith, how much hope, how much charity he might have undergone death for Christ when
living, who begged life of Him when dying? Besides all this, there is the circumstance, which
is not incredibly reported, that the thief who then believed as he hung by the side of the
crucified Lord was sprinkled, as in a most sacred baptism, with the water which issued from
the wound of the Saviour’s side. I say nothing of the fact that nobody can prove, since none
of us knows that he had not been baptized previous to his condemnation. However, let every
man take this in the sense he may prefer; only let no rule about baptism affecting the Saviour’s
own precept be taken from this example of the thief; and let no one promise for the case of
unbaptized infants, between damnation and the kingdom of heaven, some middle place of
rest and happiness, such as he pleases and where he pleases. For this is what the heresy of
Pelagius promised them: he neither fears damnation for infants, whom he does not regard
as having any original sin, nor does he give them the hope of the kingdom of heaven, since
they do not approach to the sacrament of baptism. As for this man, however, although he
acknowledges that infants are involved in original sin, he yet boldly promises them, even
without baptism, the kingdom of heaven. This even the Pelagians had not the boldness to

<p>But even if it be conceded to this man (what cannot by any means be allowed with safety
to the catholic faith and the rule of the Church), that the sacrifice of the body and blood of
Christ may be offered for unbaptized persons of every age, as if they were to be helped by
this kind of piety on the part of their friends to reaching the kingdom of heaven: what will

parents and never fall, by any mercy of God or man, into the hands of pious friends, and
who depart from that wretched life of theirs at their most tender age without the washing
of regeneration? Let him tell us, if he only can, how it is that those souls deserved to be made
sinful to such a degree as certainly never afterwards to be delivered from sin. For if I ask
him why they deserve to be condemned if they are not baptized, he will rightly answer me:
On account of original sin. If I then inquire whence they derived original sin, he will answer,
From sinful flesh, of course. If I go on to ask why they deserved to be condemned to a sinful
flesh, seeing they had done no evil before they came in the flesh, and to be so condemned
to undergo the contagion of the sin of another, that neither baptism shall regenerate them,
born as they are in sin, nor sacrifices expiate them in their pollution: let him find something
to reply to this! For in such circumstances and of such parents have these infants been born,
or are still being born, that it is not possible for them to be reached with such help. Here, at
any rate, all argument is lacking. Our question is not, why souls have deserved to be condemned
subsequently to their consorting with sinful flesh? But we ask, how it is that souls
have deserved to be condemned to undergo at all this association with sinful flesh, seeing
that they have no sin previous to this association. There is no room for him to say: “It was
no detriment to them that they shared for a season the contagion of another’s sin, since in
the prescience of God redemption had been provided for them.” For we are now speaking
of those to whom no redemption brings help, since they depart from the body before they
are baptized. Nor is there any propriety in his saying: “The souls which baptism does not
cleanse, the many sacrifices which are offered up for them will cleanse. God foreknew this,
and willed that they should for a little while be implicated in the sins of another without
incurring eternal damnation, and with the hope of eternal happiness.” For we are now
speaking of those whose birth among impious persons and of impious parents could by no
possibility find such defences and helps. And even if these could be applied, they would, it
is certain, be unable to benefit any who are unbaptized; just as the sacrifices which he has
mentioned out of the book of the Maccabees could be of no use for the sinful dead for whom
they were offered, inasmuch as they had not been circumcised.2350</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Victor’s Dilemma: He Must Either Say All Infants are Saved, or Else
God Slays the Innocent.</head>
<p>Let him, then, find an answer, if he can, when the question is asked of him, why it was
that the soul, without any sin whatever, either original or personal, deserved so to be condemned
to undergo the original sin of another as to be unable to be delivered from it; let
him see which he will choose of two alternatives: Either to say that even the souls of dying
infants who depart hence without the washing of regeneration, and for whom no sacrifice
of the Lord’s body is offered, are absolved from the bond of original sin—although the
apostle teaches that “from one all go into condemnation,”2351—all, that is, of course, to
whom grace does not find its way to help, in order that by One all might escape into redemption.
Or else to say that souls which have no sin, either their own or original, and are in
every respect innocent, simple, and pure, are punished with eternal damnation by the
righteous God when He inserts them Himself into sinful flesh without any deliverance
therefrom.</p>

<head>Chapter 15 <del>XII.</del>—God Does Not Judge Any One for What He Might Have Done
If His Life Had Been Prolonged, But Simply for the Deeds He Actually Commits.</head>
<p>For my own part, indeed, I affirm that neither of the alternative cases ought to be admitted,
nor that third opinion which would have it that souls sinned in some other state previous
to the flesh, and so deserved to be condemned to the flesh; for the apostle has most distinctly
stated that “the children being not yet born, had done neither good nor evil.”2352 So it is
evident that infants can have contracted none but original sin to require remission of sins.
Nor, again, that fourth position, that the souls of infants who will die without baptism are
by the righteous God banished and condemned to sinful flesh, since He foreknew that they
would lead evil lives if they grew old enough for the use of free will. But this not even he has
been daring enough to affirm, though embarrassed in such perplexities. On the contrary,
he has declared, briefly indeed, yet manifestly, against this vain opinion in these words:
“God would have been unrighteous if He had willed to judge any man yet unborn, who had
done nothing whatever of his own free will.” This was his answer when treating a question
in opposition to those persons who ask why God made man, when in His foreknowledge
He knew that he would not be good? He would be judging a man before he was born if He
had been unwilling to create him because He knew beforehand that he would not turn out
good. And there can be no doubt about it, even as this person himself thought, that the
proper course would be for the Almighty to judge a man for his works when accomplished,
not for such as might be foreseen, nor such as might be permitted to be done some time or
other. For if the sins which a man would have committed if he were alive are condemned
in him when dead, even when they have not been committed, no benefit is conferred on
him when he is taken away that no wickedness might change his mind; inasmuch as judgment
will be given upon him according to the wickedness which might have developed in him,
not according to the uprightness which was actually found in him. Nor will any man possibly
be safe who dies after baptism, because even after baptism men may, I will not say sin in
some way or other, but actually go so far as to commit apostasy. What then? Suppose a man
who has been taken away after baptism should, if he had lived, have become an apostate,
are we to think that no benefit was conferred even upon him in that he was removed and
was saved from the misery of his mind being changed by wickedness? And are we to imagine
that he will have to be judged, by reason of God’s foreknowledge, as an apostate, and not as
a faithful member of Christ? How much better, to be sure, would it have been—if sins are
punished not as they have been committed or contemplated by the human agent, but foreknown
and to happen in the cognizance of the Almighty—if the first pair had been cast
forth from paradise previous to their fall, and so sin have been prevented in so holy and
blessed a place! What, too, is to be said about the entire nullification of foreknowledge itself,
<note type="footnote">2352 Rom. ix. 11.</note>

<pb n="908"/>
when what is foreknown is not to happen? How, indeed, can that be rightly called the prescience
of something to be, which in fact will not come to pass? And how are sins punished
which are none, that is to say, which are not committed before the assumption of flesh, since
life itself is not yet begun; nor after the assumption, since death has prevented?</p>

<head>Chapter 16 <del>XIII.</del>—Difficulty in the Opinion Which Maintains that Souls are Not
by Propagation.</head>
<p>This means, then, of settling the point whereby the soul was sent into the flesh until
what time it should be delivered from the flesh,—seeing that the soul of an infant, which
has not grown old enough for the will to become free, is the case supposed,—makes no
discovery of the reason why condemnation should overtake it without the reception of
baptism, except the reason of original sin. Owing to this sin, we do not deny that the soul
is righteously condemned, because for sin God’s righteous law has appointed punishment.
But then we ask, why the soul has been made to undergo this sinful state, if it is not derived
from that one primeval soul which sinned in the first father of the human race. Wherefore,
if God does not condemn the innocent,—if He does not make guilty those whom He sees
to be innocent,—and if nothing liberates souls from either original sins or personal ones
but Christ’s baptism in Christ’s Church,—and if sins, before they are committed, and much
more when they have never been committed, cannot be condemned by any righteous law:
then this writer cannot adduce any of these four cases; he must, if he can, explain, in respect
to the souls of infants, which, as they quit life without baptism, are sent into condemnation,
by what desert of theirs it is that they, without having ever sinned, are consigned to a sinful
flesh, there to find the sin which is to secure their just condemnation. Moreover, if he shrinks
from these four cases which sound doctrine condemns,—that is to say, if he has not the
courage to maintain that souls, when they are even without sin, are made sinful by God, or
that they are freed from the original sin that is in them without Christ’s sacrament, or that
they committed sin in some other state before they were sent into the flesh, or that sins
which they never committed are condemned in them,—if, I say, he has not the courage to
tell us these things because they really do not deserve to be mentioned but should affirm
that infants do not inherit original sin, and have no reason why they should be condemned
should they depart hence without receiving the sacrament of regeneration, he will without
doubt, to his own condemnation, run into the damnable heresy of Pelagius. To avoid this,
how much better is it for him to share my hesitation about the soul’s origin, without daring
to affirm that which he cannot comprehend by human reason nor defend by divine authority!
So shall he not be obliged to utter foolishness, whilst he is afraid to confess his ignorance.</p>

<head>Chapter 17 <del>XIV.</del>—He Shows that the Passages of Scripture Adduced by Victor Do
Not Prove that Souls are Made by God in Such a Way as Not to Be Derived by
Propagation: First Passage.</head>
<p>Here, perhaps, he may say that his opinion is backed by divine authority, since he supposes
that he proves by passages of the Holy Scriptures that souls are not made by God by
way of propagation, but that they are by distinct acts of creation breathed afresh into each
individual. Let him prove this if he can, and I will allow that I have learnt from him what I
was trying to find out with great earnestness. But he must go in quest of other defences,
which, perhaps, he will not find, for he has not proved his point by the passages which he
has thus far advanced. For all he has applied to the subject are to some extent undoubtedly
suitable, but they afford only doubtful demonstration to the point which he raises respecting
the soul’s origin. For it is certain that God has given to man breath and spirit, as the
prophet testifies: “Thus saith the Lord, who made the heaven, and founded the earth, and
all that is therein; who giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk over
it.”2353 This passage he wishes to be taken in his own sense, which he is defending; so that
the words, “who giveth breath to the people,” may be understood as implying that He creates
souls for people not by propagation, but by insufflation of new souls in every case. Let him,
then, boldly maintain at this rate that He does not give us flesh, on the ground that our flesh
derives its original from our parents. In the instance, too, which the apostle adduces, “God
giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him,”2354 let him deny, if he dares, that corn springs from
corn, and grass from grass, from the seed, each after its kind. And if he dares not deny this,
how does he know in what sense it is said, “He giveth breath to the people”?—whether by
derivation from parents, or by fresh breathing into each individual?</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—By “Breath” Is Signified Sometimes the Holy Spirit.</head>
<p>How, again, does he know whether the repetition of the idea in the sentence, “who giveth
breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk over it,” may not be understood
of only one thing under two expressions, and may not mean, not the life or spirit whereby
human nature lives, but the Holy Spirit? For if by the “breath” the Holy Ghost could not be
signified, the Lord would not, when He “breathed upon” His disciples after His resurrection,
have said, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost.”2355 Nor would it have been thus written in the Acts
of the Apostles, “Suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as if a mighty breath were borne
in upon them; and there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon
each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.”2356 Suppose, now, that it was
this which the prophet foretold in the words, “who giveth breath unto the people upon it;”
and then, as an exposition of what he had designated “breath,” he went on to say, “and
spirit to them that walk over it.” Surely this prediction was most manifestly fulfilled when
they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. If, however, the term “people” is not yet applicable
to the one hundred and twenty persons who were then assembled together in one place, at
all events, when the number of believers amounted to four or five thousand, who when they
were baptized received the Holy Ghost,2357 can any doubt that the recipients of the Holy
Ghost were then “the people,” even “the men walking in the earth”? For that spirit which is
given to man as appertaining to his nature, whether it be given by propagation or be inbreathed
as something new to individuals (and I do not determine which of these two modes
ought to be affirmed, at least until one of the two can be clearly ascertained beyond a doubt),
is not given to men when they “walk over the earth,” but whilst they are still shut up in their
mother’s womb. “He gave breath, therefore, to the people upon the earth, and spirit to them
that walk over it,” when many became believers together, and were together filled with the
Holy Ghost. And He gives Him to His people, although not to all at the same time, but to
every one in His own time, until, by departing from this life, and by coming into it, the entire
number of His people be fulfilled. In this passage of Holy Scripture, therefore, breath is not
one thing, and spirit another thing; but there is a repetition of one and the same idea. Just
as “He that sitteth in the heavens” is not one, and “the Lord” is not another; nor, again, is
it one thing “to laugh,” and another thing “to hold in derision;” but there is only a repetition
of the same meaning in the passage where we read, “He that sitteth in the heavens shall
laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.”2358 So, in precisely the same manner, in the
passage, “I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the

earth for Thy possession,”2359 it is certainly not meant that “inheritance” is one thing, and
“possession” another thing; nor that “the heathen” means one thing, and “the uttermost
parts of the earth” another; there is only a repetition of the self-same thing. He will, indeed,
discover innumerable expressions of this sort in the sacred writings, if he will only attentively
consider what he reads.2360</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—The Meaning of “Breath” In Scripture.</head>
<p>The term, however, that is used in the Greek version, πνοή, is variously rendered in
Latin: sometimes by flatus, breath; sometimes by spiritus, spirit; sometimes by inspiratio,
inspiration. This term occurs in the Greek editions of the passage which we are now reviewing,
“Who giveth breath to the people upon it,” the word for breath being πνοή. 2361 The
same word is used in the narrative where man was endued with life: “And God breathed
upon his face the breath of life.”2362 Again, in the psalm the same term occurs: “Let every
thing that hath spirit praise the Lord.”2363 It is the same word also in the Book of Job: “The
inspiration of the Almighty is that which teaches.”2364 The translator refused the word
flatus, breath, for adspiratio, inspiration, although he had before him the very term πνοή,
which occurs in the text of the prophet which we are considering. We can hardly doubt, I
think, that in this passage of Job the Holy Ghost is signified. The question discussed was
concerning wisdom, whence it comes to men: “It cometh not from number of years; but
the Spirit is in mortals, and the inspiration of the Almighty is that which teaches.”2365 By
this repetition of terms it may be quite understood that he did not speak of man’s own
spirit in the clause, “The Spirit is in mortals.” He wanted to show whence men have wisdom,—
that it is not from their own selves; so by using a duplicate expression he explains
his idea; “The inspiration of the Almighty is that which teaches.” Similarly, in another passage
of the same book, he says, “The understanding of my lips shall meditate purity. The divine
Spirit is that which formed me, and the breath of the Almighty is that which teacheth me.”2366
Here, likewise, what he calls adspiratio, or “inspiration,” is in Greek πνοή, the same word
which is translated flatus, “breath,” in the passage quoted from the prophet. Therefore, although
it is rash to deny that the passage, “Who giveth breath to the people upon it, and
spirit to them that walk over it,” has reference to the soul or spirit of man,—although the
Holy Ghost may with greater credibility be understood as referred to in the passage: yet I
ask on what ground anybody can boldly determine that the prophet meant in these words
to intimate that the soul or spirit whereby our nature possesses vitality <del>is not given to us</del>

<head>Chapter 20.—Other Ways of Taking the Passage.</head>
<p>There are also some persons who understand the prophet’s words, “He gave breath to
the people upon it,” that is to say, upon the earth, as if the word “breath,” flatus, were simply
equivalent to “soul,” anima; while they construe the next clause, “and spirit to them that
walk over it,” as referring to the Holy Ghost; and they suppose that the same order is observed
by the prophet that is mentioned by the apostle: “That was not first which is spiritual, but
that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.”2368 Now from this view of the
prophet’s words an elegant interpretation may, no doubt, be formed consistent with the
apostle’s sense. The phrase, “to them that walk over it,” is in the Latin, “calcantibus eam;”
and as the literal meaning of these words is “treading upon it,” we may understand the idea
of contempt of it to be implied. For they who receive the Holy Ghost despise earthly things
in their love of heavenly things. None of these opinions, however, is contrary to the faith,
whether one regards the two terms, breath and spirit, to pertain to human nature, or both
of them to the Holy Ghost, or one of them, breath, to the soul, and the other, spirit, to the
Holy Ghost. If, however, the soul and spirit of the human being be the meaning here, since
undoubtedly it ought to be, as the gift of God to him, then we must further inquire, in what
way does God bestow this gift? Is it by propagation, as He gives us our bodily limbs by this
process? Or is it bestowed on each person severally by God’s inbreathing, not by propagation,
but as always a fresh creation? These questions are not ambiguous, as this man would make
them; but we wish that they be defended by the most certain warrant of the divine Scriptures.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—The Second Passage Quoted by Victor.</head>
<p>On the same principle we treat the passage in which God says: “For my Spirit shall go
forth from me; and I have created every breath.”2369 Here the former clause, “My Spirit
shall go forth from me, must be taken as referring to the Holy Ghost, of whom the Saviour
similarly says, “He proceedeth from the Father.”2370 But the other clause, “I have created
every breath,” is undeniably spoken of each individual soul. Well; but God also creates the
entire body of man; and, as nobody doubts, He makes the human body by the process of
propagation: it is therefore, of course, still open to inquiry concerning the soul (since it is
evidently God’s work), whether He creates it as He does the body; by propagation, or by
inbreathing, as He made the first soul.</p>

mode of the formation. Now let us take the eye of the body, and ask, who but God forms it?
I suppose that He forms it not externally, but in itself, and yet, most certainly, by propagation.
Since, then, He also forms “the human spirit in him,” the question still remains, whether it
be derived by a fresh insufflation in every instance, or by propagation.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—His Fourth Quotation.</head>
<p>We have read all about the mother of the Maccabean youths, who was really more
fruitful in virtues when her children suffered than of children when they were born; how
she exhorted them to constancy, speaking in this wise: “I cannot tell, my sons, how ye came
into my womb. For it was not I who gave you spirit and soul, nor was it I that formed the
members of every one of you; but it was God, who also made the world, and all things that
are therein; who, moreover, formed the generation of men; and searches the action2372 of
all; and who will Himself of His great mercy restore to you your spirit and soul.”2373 All
this we know; but how it supports this man’s assertion we do not see. For what Christian
would deny that God gives to men soul and spirit? But similarly, I suppose that he cannot
deny that God gives to men their tongue, and ear, and hand, and foot, and all their bodily
sensations, and the form and nature of all their limbs. For how is he going to deny all these
to be the gifts of God, unless he forgets that he is a Christian? As, however, it is evident that
these were made by Him, and bestowed on man by propagation; so also the question must
arise, by what means man’s spirit and soul are formed by Him; by what efficiency given to
man—from the parents, or from nothing, or (as this man asserts, in a sense which we must
by all means guard against) from some existing nature of the divine breath, not created out
of nothing, but out of His own self?</p>

Traduce), His Cited Passages Fail to Show.</head>
<p>Forasmuch, then, as the passages of Scripture which he mentions by no means show
what he endeavours to enforce (since, indeed, they express nothing at all on the immediate
question before us), what can be the meaning of these words of his: “We firmly maintain
that the soul comes from the breath of God, not from natural generation, because it is given
from God”? As if, forsooth, the body could be given from another, than from Him by whom
it is created, “Of whom are all things, through whom are all things, in whom are all
things;”2374 not that they are of His nature, but of His workmanship. “Nor is it from nothing,”
says he, “because it comes forth from God.” Whether this be so, is (we must say) not the
question to be here entertained. At the same time, we do not hesitate to affirm, that the
proposition which he advances, that the soul comes to man neither out of descent nor out
of nothing, is certainly not true: this, I say, we affirm to be without doubt not true. For it is
one of two things: if the soul is not derived by natural descent from the parent, it comes out
of nothing. To pretend that it is derived from God in such wise as to be a portion of His
nature, is simply sacrilegious blasphemy. But we solicit and seek up to the present time some
plain passages of Scripture bearing on the point, whether the soul does not come by parental
descent; but we do not want such passages as he has adduced, which yield no illustration of
the question now before us.</p>

So We Know Not Whence Comes the Soul.</head>
<p>How I wish that, on so profound a question, so long as he is ignorant what he should
say, he would imitate the mother of the Maccabean youths! Although she knew very well
that she had conceived children of her husband, and that they had been created for her by
the Creator of all, both in body and in soul and spirit, yet she says, “I cannot tell, my sons,
how ye came into my womb.” Well now, I only wish this man would tell us that which she
was ignorant of! She, of course, knew (on the points I have mentioned) how they came into
her womb as to their bodily substance, because she could not possibly doubt that she had
conceived them by her husband. She furthermore confessed—because this, too, she was, of
course, well aware of—that it was God who gave them their soul and spirit, and that it was
He also who formed for them their features and their limbs. What was it, then, that she was
so ignorant of? Was it not probably (what we likewise are equally unable to determine)
whether the soul and spirit, which God no doubt bestowed upon them, was derived to them
from their parents, or breathed into them separately as it had been into the first man? But
whether it was this, or some other particular respecting the constitution of human nature,
of which she was ignorant, she frankly confessed her ignorance; and did not venture to defend
at random what she knew nothing about. Nor would this man say to her, what he has not
been ashamed to say to us: “Man being in honour doth not understand; he is compared to
the senseless cattle, and is like unto them.”2375 Behold how that woman said of her sons, “I
cannot tell how ye came into my womb,” and yet she is not compared to the senseless brutes.
“I cannot tell,” she said; then, as if they would inquire of her why she was ignorant, she went
on to say, “For it was not I who gave you spirit and soul.” He, therefore, who gave them that
gift, knows whence He made what He gave, whether He communicated it by propagation,
or breathed it as a fresh creation,—a point which (this man says) I for my part know nothing
of. “Nor was it I that formed the features and members of every one of you.” He, however,
who formed them, knows whether He formed them with the soul, or gave the soul to them
after they had been formed. She had no idea of the manner, this or that, in which her sons
came into her womb; only one thing was she sure of, that He who gave her all she had would
restore to her what He gave. But this man would choose out what that woman was ignorant
of, on so profound and abstruse a fact of our nature; only he would not judge her, if in error;
nor compare her, if ignorant, to the senseless cattle. Whatever the point was about which
she was ignorant, it certainly pertained to man’s nature; and yet anybody would be blameless
for such ignorance. Wherefore, I too, on my side, say concerning my soul, I have no certain
knowledge how it came into my body; for it was not I who gave it to myself. He who gave
it to me knows whether He imparted it to me from my father, or created it afresh for me,

<p>“Learn,” says he, “for, behold the apostle teaches you.” Yes, indeed, I will learn, if the

the apostle teaches? “Behold,” he adds, “how, when speaking to the men of Athens, he
strongly set forth this truth, saying: ‘Seeing He giveth to all life and spirit.’” Well, who thinks
of denying this? “But understand,” he says, “what it is the apostle states: He giveth; not, He
hath given. He refers us to continuous and indefinite time, and does not proclaim past and
completed time. Now that which he gives without cessation, He is always giving; just as He
who gives is Himself ever existent.” I have quoted his words precisely as I found them in
the second of the books which you sent me. First, I beg you to notice to what lengths he has
gone, while endeavouring to affirm what he knows nothing about. For he has dared to say,
that God, without any cessation, and not merely in the present time, but for ever and ever,
gives souls to persons when they are born. “He is always giving,” says he, “just as He who
gives is Himself ever existent.” Far be it from me to say that I do not understand what the
apostle said, for it is plain enough. But what this man says, he even ought himself to know,
is contrary to the Christian faith; and he should be on his guard against going any further
in such assertions. For, of course, when the dead shall rise again, there will be no more
persons to be born; therefore God will bestow no longer any souls at any birth; but those
which He is now giving to men along with their bodies He will judge. So that He is not always
giving, although He is ever existent, who at present is giving. Nor, indeed, is that at all derivable
from the apostle’s expression, who giveth (not hath given), which this writer wishes to
deduce, namely, that God does not give men souls by propagation. For souls are still given
by Him, even if it be by propagation; even as bodily endowments, such as limbs, and sensations,
and shape, and, in fact, the whole substance, are given by God Himself to human beings,
although it be by propagation that He gives them. Nor again, because the Lord says,2376 “If
God so clothes the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven”
(not using the preterite time, hath clothed, as when He first formed the material; but employing
the present form, clothes, which, indeed, He still is doing), shall we on that account say,
that the lilies are not produced from the original source of their own kind. What, therefore,
if the soul and spirit of a human being in like manner is given by God Himself, whenever
it is given; and given, too, by propagation from its own kind? Now this is a position which
I neither maintain nor refute. Nevertheless, if it must be defended or confuted, I certainly
recommend its being done by clear, and not doubtful proofs. Nor do I deserve to be compared
with senseless cattle because I avow myself to be as yet incapable of determining the question,
but rather with cautious persons, because I do not recklessly teach what I know nothing
about. But I am not disposed on my own part to return railing for railing and compare this

to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm.”2377</p>

<head>Chapter 27 <del>XVII.</del>—Augustin Did Not Venture to Define Anything About the
Propagation of the Soul.</head>
<p>For whence comes it that he is so careless about the Scriptures, which he talks of, as not
to notice that when he reads of human beings being from God, it is not merely, as he contends,
in respect of their soul and spirit, but also as regards their body? For the apostle’s
statement, “We are His offspring,”2378 this man supposes must not be referred to the body,
but only to the soul and spirit. If, indeed, our human bodies are not of God, then that is
false which the Scripture says: “For of Him are all things, through Him are all things, and
in Him are all things.”2379 Again, with reference to the same apostle’s statement, “For as
the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman,”2380 let him explain to us what
propagation he would choose to be meant in the process,—that of the soul, or of the body,
or of both? But he will not allow that souls come by propagation: it remains, therefore, that,
according to him and all who deny the propagation of souls, the apostle signified the masculine
and feminine body only, when he said, “As the woman is of the man, so also is the
man by the woman;” the woman having been made out of the man, in order that the man
might afterwards, by the process of birth, come out of the woman. If, therefore, the apostle,
when he said this, did not intend the soul and spirit also to be understood, but only the
bodies of the two sexes, why does he immediately add, “But all things are of God,”2381 unless
it be that bodies also are of God? For so runs his entire statement: “As the woman is of the
man, so also is the man by the woman; but all things are of God.” Let, then, our disputant
determine of what this is said. If of men’s bodies, then, of course, even bodies are of God.
How comes it to pass, therefore, that whenever this person reads in Scripture the phrase,
“of God,” when man is in question, he will have the words understood, not in reference to
men’s bodies, but only as concerning their souls and spirits? But if the expression, “All things
are of God,” was spoken both of the body of the two sexes, and of their soul and spirit, it
follows that in all things the woman is of the man, for the woman comes from the man, and
the man is by the woman: but all things of God. What “all things” are meant, except those
he was speaking of, namely, the man of whom came the woman, and the woman who was
of the man, and also the man who came by the woman? For that man came not by woman,
out of whom came the woman; but only he who afterwards was born of man by woman,
just as men are now born. Hence it follows that if the apostle, when he said the words we
have quoted from him, spoke of men’s bodies, undoubtedly the bodies of persons of both

<note type="footnote">2381 1 Cor. xi. 12.</note>

<pb n="925"/>
sexes are of God. Furthermore, if he insists that nothing in man comes from God except
their souls and spirits, then, of course, the woman is of the man even as regards her soul
and spirit; so that nothing is left to those who dispute against the propagation of souls. But
if he is for dividing the subject in such a manner as to say that the woman is of the man as
regards her body, but is of God in respect of her soul and spirit, how, then, will that be true
which the apostle says, “All things of God,” if the woman’s body is of the man in such a
sense that it is not of God? Wherefore, allowing that the apostle is more likely to speak the
truth than that this person must be preferred as an authority to the apostle, the woman is
of the man, whether in regard to her body only, or in reference to the entire whole of which
human nature consists (but we assert nothing on these points as an absolute certainty, but
are still inquiring after their truth); and the man is through the woman, whether it be that
his whole nature as man is derived to him from his father, and is born in him through the
woman, or the flesh alone; about which points the question is still undecided. “All things,
however, are of God,” and about this there is no question; and in this phrase are included
the body, soul, and spirit, both of the man and the woman. For even if they were not born
or derived from God, or emanated from Him as portions of His nature, yet they are of God,
inasmuch as whatever is created, formed, and made by Him, has from Him the reality of its
existence.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—A Natural Figure of Speech Must Not Be Literally Pressed.</head>
<p>He goes on to remark: “But the apostle, by saying, ‘And He Himself giveth life and
spirit to all,’ and then by adding the words, ‘And hath made the whole race of men of one
blood,’2382 has referred this soul and spirit to the Creator in respect of their origin, and the
body to propagation.” Now, certainly any one who does not wish to deny at random the
propagation of souls, before ascertaining clearly whether the opinion is correct or not, has
ground for understanding, from the apostle’s words, that he meant the expression, of one
blood, to be equivalent to of one man, by the figure of speech which understands the whole
from its part. Well, then, if it be allowable for this man to take the whole from a part in the
passage, “And man became a living soul,”2383 as if the spirit also was understood to be implied,
about which the Scripture there said nothing, why is it not allowable to others to attribute
an equally comprehensive sense to the expression, of one blood, so that the soul and
spirit may be considered as included in it, on the ground that the human being who is signified
by the term “blood” consists not of body alone, but also of soul and spirit? For just as
the controversialist who maintains the propagation of souls, ought not, on the one hand,
to press this man too hard, because the Scripture says concerning the first man, “In whom
all have sinned”2384 (for the expression is not, In whom the flesh of all has sinned, but “all,”
that is, “all men,” seeing that man is not flesh only);—as, I repeat, he ought not to be too
hard pressed himself, because it happens to be written “all men,” in such a way that they
might be understood simply in respect of the flesh; so, on the other hand, he ought not to
bear too hard on those who hold the propagation of souls, on the ground of the phrase,
“The whole race of men of one blood,” as if this passage proved that flesh alone was transmitted
by propagation. For if it is true, as they2385 assert, that soul does not descend from
soul, but flesh only from flesh, then the expression, “of one blood,” does not signify the entire
human being, on the principle of a part for the whole, but merely the flesh of one person
alone; while that other expression, “In whom all have sinned,” must be so understood as to
indicate merely the flesh of all men, which has been handed on from the first man, the
Scripture signifying a part by the whole. If, on the other hand, it is true that the entire human
being is propagated of each man, himself also entire, consisting of body, soul, and spirit,
then the passage, “In whom all have sinned,” must be taken in its proper literal sense; and
the other phrase, “of one blood,” is used metaphorically, the whole being signified by a part,
that is to say, the whole man who consists of soul and flesh; or rather (as this person is fond
of putting it) of soul, and spirit, and flesh. For both modes of expression the Holy Scriptures

are in the habit of employing, putting both a part for the whole and the whole for a part. A
part, for instance, implies the whole, in the place where it is said, “Unto Thee shall all flesh
come;”2386 the whole man being understood by the term flesh. And the whole sometimes
implies a part, as when it is said that Christ was buried, whereas it was only His flesh that
was buried. Now as regards the statement which is made in the apostle’s testimony, to the
effect that “He giveth life and spirit to all,” I suppose that nobody, after the foregoing discussion,
will be moved by it. No doubt “He giveth;” the fact is not in dispute; our question is,
How does He give it? By fresh inbreathing in every instance, or by propagation? For with
perfect propriety is He said to give the substance of the flesh to the human being, though
at the same time it is not denied that He gives it by means of propagation.</p>

<head>Chapter 29 <del>XVIII.</del>—The Sixth Passage of Scripture Quoted by Victor.</head>
<p>Let us now look at the quotation from Genesis, where the woman was created out of
the side of the man, and was brought to him, and he said: “This is now bone of my bones,
and flesh of my flesh.” Our opponent thinks that “Adam ought to have said, ‘Soul of my
soul, or spirit of my spirit,’ if this, too, had been derived from him.” But, in fact, they who
maintain the opinion of the propagation of souls feel that they possess a more impregnable
defence of their position in the fact that in the Scripture narrative which informs us that
God took a rib out of the man’s side and formed it into a woman, it is not added that He
breathed into her face the breath of life; for this reason, as they say, because she had already
been ensouled2387 from the man. If, indeed, she had not, they say, the sacred Scripture would
certainly not have kept us in ignorance of the circumstance. With regard to the fact that
Adam says, “This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh,”2388 without adding,
Spirit or soul, from my spirit or soul, they may answer, just as it has been already shown,
that the expression, “my flesh and bone,” may be understood as indicating the whole by a
part, only that the portion that was taken out of man was not dead, but ensouled;2389 for
no good ground for denying that the Almighty was able to do all this is furnished by the
circumstance that not a human being could be found capable of cutting off a part of a man’s
flesh along with the soul. Adam went on, however, to say, “She shall be called woman, because
she was taken out of man.”2390 Now, why does he not rather say (and thus confirm the
opinion of our opponents), “Since her flesh was taken out of man”? As the case stands, indeed,
they who hold the opposite view may well contend, from the fact that it is written, not woman’s
flesh, but the woman herself was taken out of man, that she must be considered in
her entire nature endued with soul and spirit. For although the soul is undistinguished by
sex, yet when women are mentioned it is not necessary to regard them apart from the soul.
On no other principle would they be thus admonished with respect to self-adornment. “Not
with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but which (says the apostle) becometh
women professing godliness with a good conversation.”2391 Now, “godliness,” of course, is
an inner principle in the soul or spirit; and yet they are called women, although the ornamentation
concerns that internal portion of their nature which has no sex.</p>

<head>Chapter 30—The Danger of Arguing from Silence.</head>
<p>Now, while the disputants are thus contending with one another in alternate argument,
I so judge between them that they must not rely on uncertain evidence; nor make bold assertions
on points of which they are ignorant. For if the Scripture had said, “God breathed
into the woman’s face the breath of life, and she became a living soul,” it would not have
followed even then that the human soul is not derived by propagation from parents, except
the same statement were likewise made concerning their son. For it might have been that
whilst an unensouled2392 member taken from the body might require to be ensouled,2393
yet that the soul of the son might be derived from the father, transfused by propagation
through the mother. There is, however, an absolute silence on the point; it is entirely concealed
from our view. Nothing is denied, but at the same time nothing is affirmed. And
thus, if in any place the Scripture is possibly not quite silent, the point requires to be supported
by clearer proofs. Whence it follows, that neither they who maintain the propagation
of souls receive any assistance from the circumstance that God did not breathe into the
woman’s face; nor ought they, who deny this doctrine on the ground that Adam did not
say, “This is soul of my soul,” to persuade themselves to believe what they know nothing of.
For just as it has been possible for the Scripture to be silent on the point of the woman’s
having received her soul, like the man, by the inbreathing of God, without the question before
us being solved, but, on the contrary, remaining open; so has it been possible for the same
question to remain open and unsolved, notwithstanding the silence of Scripture, as to
whether or not Adam said, This is soul of my soul. And hence, if the soul of the first woman
comes from the man, a part signifies the whole in his exclamation, “This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh;” inasmuch as not her flesh alone, but the entire woman, was
taken out of man. If, however, it is not from the man, but came by God’s inbreathing it into
her, as at first into the man, then the whole signifies a part in the passage, “She was taken
out of the man;” since on the supposition it was not her whole self, but her flesh that was
taken.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—The Argument of the Apollinarians to Prove that Christ Was Without
the Human Soul of This Same Sort.</head>
<p>Although, then, this question remains unsolved by these passages of Scripture, which
are certainly indecisive so far as pertains to the point before us, yet I am quite sure of this,
that those persons who think that the soul of the first woman did not come from her husband’s
soul, on the ground of its being only said, “Flesh of my flesh,” and not, “Soul of my
soul,” do, in fact, argue in precisely the same manner as the Apollinarians argue, and all
such gainsayers, in opposition to the Lord’s human soul, which they deny for no other
reason than because they read in the Scripture, “The Word was made flesh.”2394 For if, say
they, there was a soul in Him also, it ought to have been said, “The Word was made man.”
But the reason why the great truth is stated in the terms in question really is, that under the
designation flesh, Holy Scripture is accustomed to describe the entire human being, as in
the passage, “And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”2395 For flesh alone without the
soul cannot see anything. Besides, many other passages of the Holy Scriptures go to make
it manifest, without any ambiguity, that in the man Christ there is not only flesh, but a human—
that is, a reasonable—soul also. Whence they, who maintain the propagation of souls
might also understand that a part is put for the whole in the passage, “Bone of my bone,
and flesh of my flesh,” in such wise that the soul, too, be understood as implied in the words,
in the same manner as we believe that the Word became flesh, not without the soul. All that
is wanted is, that they should support their opinion of the propagation of souls on passages
which are unambiguous; just as other passages of Scripture show us that Christ possesses a
human soul. On precisely the same principle we advise the other side also, who do away
with the opinion of the propagation of souls, that they should produce certain proofs for
their assertion that souls are created by God in every fresh case by insufflation, and that
they should then maintain the position that the saying, “This is bone of my bone, and flesh
of my flesh,” was not spoken figuratively as a part for the whole, including the soul in its
signification, but in a bare literal sense of the flesh alone.</p>

who peruse its contents will know how to be on their guard against agreeing with the person
whose two books you sent me, so as not to believe with him, that souls are produced by the
breath of God in such wise as not to be made out of nothing. The man, indeed, who supposes
this, however much he may in words deny the conclusion, does in reality affirm that souls
have the substance of God, and are His offspring, not by endowment, but by nature. For
from whomsoever a man derives the origin of his nature, from him, in all sober earnestness,
it must needs be admitted, that he also derives the kind of his nature. But this author is,
after all, self-contradictory: at one time he says that “souls are the offspring of God,—not,
indeed, by nature, but by endowment;” and at another time he says, that “they are not made
out of nothing, but derive their origin from God.” Thus he does not hesitate to refer them
to the nature of God, a position which he had previously denied.</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—Augustin Has No Objection to the Opinion About the Propagation
of Souls Being Refuted, and that About Their Insufflation Being Maintained.</head>
<p>As for the opinion, that new souls are created by inbreathing without being propagated,
we certainly do not in the least object to its maintenance,—only let it be by persons who
have succeeded in discovering some new evidence, either in the canonical Scriptures, in the
shape of unambiguous testimony towards the solution of a most knotty question, or else in
their own reasonings, such as shall not be opposed to catholic truth, but not by such persons
as this man has shown himself to be. Unable to find anything worth saying, and at the same
time unwilling to suspend his disputatious propensity, without measuring his strength at
all, in order to avoid saying nothing, he boldly affirmed that “the soul deserved to be polluted
by the flesh,” and that “the soul deserved to become sinful;” though previous to its incarnation
he was unable to discover any merit in it, whether good or evil. Moreover, that “in infants
departing from the body without baptism original sin may be remitted, and that the sacrifice
of Christ’s body must be offered for them,” who have not been incorporated into Christ
through His sacraments in His Church, and that “they, quitting this present life without the
laver of regeneration, not only can go to rest, but can even attain to the kingdom of heaven.”
He has propounded a good many other absurdities, which it would be evidently tedious to
collect together, and to consider in this treatise. If the doctrine of the propagation of souls
is false, may its refutation not be the work of such disputants; and may the defence of the
rival principle of the insufflation of new souls in every creative act, proceed from better
hands.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—The Mistakes Which Must Be Avoided by Those Who Say that Men’s
Souls are Not Derived from Their Parents, But are Afresh Inbreathed by God in
Every Instance.</head>
<p>All, therefore, who wish to maintain that new souls are rightly said to be breathed into
persons at their birth, and not derived from their parents, must by all means be cautious on
each of the four points which I have already mentioned. That is to say, do not let them affirm
that souls become sinful by another’s original sin; do not let them affirm that infants who
died unbaptized can possibly reach eternal life and the kingdom of heaven by the remission
of original sin in any other way whatever; do not let them affirm that souls had sinned in
some other place previous to their incarnation, and that on this account they were forcibly
introduced into sinful flesh; nor let them affirm that the sins which were not actually found
in them were, because they were foreknown, deservedly punished, although they were never
permitted to reach that life where they could be committed. Provided that they affirm none
of these points, because each of them is simply false and impious, they may, if they can,
produce any conclusive testimonies of the Holy Scriptures on this question; and they may
maintain their own opinion, not only without any prohibition from me, but even with my
approbation and best thanks. If, however, they fail to discover any very decided authority
on the point in the divine oracles, and are obliged to propound any one of the four opinions
by reason of their failure, let them restrain their imagination, lest they should be driven in
their difficulty to enunciate the now damnable and very recently condemned heresy of
Pelagius, to the effect that the souls of infants have not original sin. It is, indeed, better for
a man to confess his ignorance of what he knows nothing about, than either to run into
heresy which has been already condemned, or to found some new heresy, while recklessly
daring to defend over and over again opinions which only display his ignorance. This man
has made some other absurd mistakes, indeed many, in which he has wandered out of the
beaten track of truth, without going, however, to dangerous lengths; and I would like, if the

young man, in such a way, however, as to show that I love him, wishing him to be amended
rather than condemned, and to make such progress in the great house which is the catholic
Church, whither the divine compassion has conducted him, that he may be therein “a vessel
unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the Master’s use, and prepared unto every good
work,”2396 both by holy living and sound teaching. But I have this further to say: if it behoves
me to bestow my love upon him, as I sincerely do, how much more ought I to love you, my
brother, whose affection towards me and whose catholic faith I have found by the best of
proofs to be cautious and sober! The result of your loyalty has been, that you have, with a

you did it, that I think I should have had a right, on the true claims of friendship, to have
been angry with you if you had not done it. I therefore give you my most earnest thanks.
Moreover, I have afforded a still plainer indication of the spirit in which I have accepted

<p>There have reached me the two books of Vincentius Victor, which he addressed in
writing to your Holiness; they have been forwarded to me by our brother Renatus, a layman
indeed, but a person who has a prudent and religious care about the faith both of himself
and of all he loves. On reading these books, I saw that their author was a man of great resources
in speech, of which he had enough, and more than enough; but that on the subjects
of which he wished to teach, he was as yet insufficiently instructed. If, however, by the gracious
gift of the Lord this qualification were also conferred upon him, he would be serviceable
to many. For he possesses in no slight degree the faculty of explaining and beautifying what
he thinks; all that is wanted is, that he should first take care to think rightly. Depraved eloquence
is a hurtful accomplishment; for to persons of inadequate information it always
carries the appearance of truth in its readiness of speech. I know not, indeed, how you received
his books; but if I am correctly informed, you are said, after reading them, to have
been so greatly overjoyed, that you (though an elderly man and a presbyter) kissed the face
of this youthful layman, and thanked him for having taught you what you had been previously
ignorant of. Now, in this conduct of yours I do not disapprove of your humility; indeed, I
rather commend it; for it was not the man whom you praised, but the truth itself which
deigned to speak to you through him: only I wish you were able to point out to me what
was the truth which you received through him. I should, therefore, be glad if you would

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—He Asks What the Great Knowledge is that Victor Imparts.</head>
<p>Therefore, brother greatly beloved, I desire to know what you learned of him, in order
that, if I have already possessed the knowledge, I may participate in your joy; but if I happen
to be ignorant, I may be instructed by you. Did you not then understand that there are two
somethings, soul and spirit, according as it is said in Scripture, “Thou wilt separate my soul
from my spirit”?2397 And that both of them pertain to man’s nature, so that the whole man
consists of spirit, and soul, and body? Sometimes, however, these two are combined together
under the designation of soul; for instance, in the passage, “And man became a living
soul.”2398 Now, in this place the spirit is implied. Similarly in sundry passages the two are
described under the name of spirit, as when it is written, “And He bowed His head and gave
up the spirit;”2399 in which passage it is the soul that must also be understood. And that the
two are of one and the same substance? I suppose that you already knew all this. But if you
did not, then you may as well know that you have not acquired any great knowledge, the
ignorance of which would be attended with much danger. And if there must be any more
subtle discussion on such points it would be better to carry on the controversy with himself,
whose wordy qualities we have already discovered. The questions we might consider are:
whether, when mention is made of the soul, the spirit is also implied in the term in such a
way that the two comprise the soul, the spirit being, as it were, some part of it,—whether,
in fact (as this person seemed to think), under the designation soul, the whole is so designated
from only a part; or else, whether the two together make up the spirit, that which is properly
called soul being a part thereof; whether again, in fact, the whole is not called from only a
part, when the term spirit is used in such a wide sense as to comprehend the soul also, as
this man supposes. These, however, are but subtle distinctions, and ignorance about them
certainly is not attended with any great danger.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—The Difference Between the Senses of the Body and Soul.</head>
<p>Again, I wonder whether this man taught you the difference between the bodily senses
and the sensibilities of the soul; and whether you, who were a person of considerable age
and position before you took lessons of this man, used to consider to be one and the same
that faculty by which white and black are distinguished, which sparrows even see as well as
ourselves, and that by which justice and injustice are discriminated, which Tobit also perceived
even after he lost the sight of his eyes.2400 If you held the identity, then, of course,
when you heard or read the words, “Lighten my eyes, that I sleep not in death,”2401 you
merely thought of the eyes of the body. Or if this were an obscure point, at all events when
you recalled the words of the apostle, “The eyes of your heart being enlightened,”2402 you
must have supposed that we possessed a heart somewhere between our forehead and cheeks.
Well, I am very far from thinking this of you, so that this instructor of yours could not have
given you such a lesson.</p>

<p>And if you happened to suppose, before receiving the instruction from this teacher,
which you are rejoicing to have received, that the human soul is a portion of God’s nature,
then you were ignorant how false and terribly dangerous this opinion was. And if you only
were taught by this person that the soul is not a portion of God, then I bid you thank God
as earnestly as you can that you were not taken away out of the body before learning so
important a lesson. For you would have quitted life a great heretic and a terrible blasphemer.
However, I never could have believed this of you, that a man who is both a catholic and a
presbyter of no contemptible position like yourself, could by any means have thought that

<head>Chapter 5 <del>III.</del>—In What Sense Created Beings are Out of God.</head>
<p>Now, just because I do not suppose that you, a member of the catholic Church, ever
believed the human soul to be a portion of God, or that the soul’s nature is in any degree
identical with God’s, I have some apprehension lest you may have been induced to fall in
with this man’s opinion, that “God did not make the soul from nothing, but that the soul
is so far out of Him as to have emanated from Him.” For he has put out such a statement
as this, with his other opinions, which have led him out of the usual track on this subject to
a huge precipice. Now, if he has taught you this, I do not want you to teach it to me; nay, I
should wish you to unlearn what you have been taught. For it is not enough to avoid believing
and saying that the soul is a part of God. We do not even say that the Son or the Holy Ghost
is a part of God, although we affirm that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all of
one and the same nature. It is not, then, enough for us to avoid saying that the soul is a part
of God, but it is of indispensable importance that we should say that the soul and God are
not of one and the self-same nature. This person is therefore right in declaring that “souls
are God’s offspring, not by nature, but by gift;” and then, of course, not the souls of all men,
but of the faithful. But afterwards he returned to the statement from which he had shrunk,
and affirmed that God and the soul are of the same nature—not, indeed, in so many words,
but plainly and manifestly to such a purport. For when he says that the soul is out of God,
in such a manner that God created it not out of any other nature, nor out of nothing, but
out of His own self, what would he have us believe but the very thing which he denies, in
other words, even that the soul is of the self-same nature as God Himself is? For every nature
is either God, who has no author; or out of God, as having Him for its Author. But the nature
which has for its author God, out of whom it comes, is either not made, or made. Now, that
nature which is not made and yet is out of Him, is either begotten by Him or proceeds from
Him. That which is begotten is His only Son, that which proceedeth is the Holy Ghost, and
this Trinity is of one and the self-same nature. For these three are one, and each one is God,
and all three together are one God, unchangeable, eternal, without any beginning or ending
of time. That nature, on the other hand, which is made is called “creature;” God is its Creator,
even the blessed Trinity. The creature, therefore, is said to be out of God in such wise as not
to be made out of His nature. It is predicated as out of Him, inasmuch as it has in Him the
author of its being, not so as to have been born of Him, or to have proceeded from Him,
but as having been created, moulded, and formed by Him, in some cases, out of no other
substance,—that is, absolutely out of nothing, as, for instance, the heaven and the earth, or
rather the whole material of the universe coeval in its creation with the world—but, in some
cases, out of another nature already created and in existence, as, for instance, man out of
the dust, woman out of the man, and man out of his parents. Still, every creature is out of
God,—but out of God as its creator either out of nothing, or out of something previously
existing, not, however, as its begetter or its producer from His own very self.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Shall God’s Nature Be Mutable, Sinful, Impious, Even Eternally Damned.</head>
<p>All this, however, I am saying to a catholic: advising with him rather than teaching him.
For I do not suppose that these things are new to you; or that they have been long heard of
by you, but not believed. This epistle of mine, you will, I am sure, so read as to recognise in
its statement your own faith also, which is by the gracious gift of the Lord the common
property of us all in the catholic Church. Since, then (as I was saying), I am now speaking
to a catholic, whence I pray you tell me, do you suppose that the soul, I will not say your
soul or my own soul, but the soul of the first man, was given to him? If you admit that it
came from nothing, made, however, and inbreathed into him by God, then your belief tallies
with my own. If, on the contrary, you suppose that it came out of some other created thing,
which served as the material, as it were, for the divine Artificer to make the soul out of, just
as the dust was the material of which Adam was formed, or the rib whence Eve was made,
or the waters whence the fishes and the fowls were created, or the ground out of which the
terrestrial animals were formed: then this opinion is not catholic, nor is it true. But further,
if you think, which may God forbid, that the divine Creator made, or is still making, human
souls neither out of nothing, nor out of some other created thing, but out of His own self,
that is, out of His own nature, then you have learnt this of your new instructor; but I cannot
congratulate you, or flatter you, on the discovery. You have wandered along with him very
far from the catholic faith. Better would it be, though it would be untrue, yet it would be
better, I say, and more tolerable, that you should believe the soul to have been made out of
some other created substance which God had already formed, than out of God’s own uncreated
substance, so that what is mutable, and sinful, and impious, and if persistent to the end
in the impiety will have to suffer eternal damnation, should not with horrible blasphemy
be referred to the nature of God! Away, brother, I beseech you, away with this, I will not
call it faith, but execrably impious error. May God avert from you, a man of gravity and a
presbyter, the misery of being seduced by a youthful layman; and, while supposing that your
opinion is the catholic faith, of being lost from the number of the faithful. For I must not
deal with you as I might with him; nor does this tremendous error, when yours, deserve the
same indulgence as being that of this young man, although you may have derived it from
him. He has but just now found his way to the catholic fold to get healing and safety;2403
you have a rank among the very shepherds of that fold. But we would not that a sheep which
comes to the Lord’s flock for shelter from error, should be healed of his sores in such a way,
as first to infect and destroy the shepherd by his contagious presence.</p>

your humble thanks to your instructor were further earned by your having acquired from

difficult than serviceable. If, however, the Lord will that I should write to this young man

<head>Chapter 8.—The Thirst of the Rich Man in Hell Does Not Prove the Soul to Be
Corporeal.</head>
<p>Now with regard to the point, which with perfect propriety and great soundness of view
he believes, that souls after quitting the body are judged, before they come to that final
judgment to which they must submit when their bodies are restored to them, and are either
tormented or glorified in the very same flesh wherein they once lived here on earth; is it, let
me ask you, the case that you were really ignorant of this? Who ever had his mind so obstinately
set against the gospel as not to hear these truths, and after hearing to believe them, in
the parable of the poor man who was carried away after death to Abraham’s bosom, and of
the rich man who is set forth as suffering torment in hell?2405 But has this man taught you
how it was that the soul apart from the body could crave from the beggar’s finger a drop of
water;2406 when he himself confessed, that the soul did not require bodily aliment except
for the purpose of protecting the perishing body which encloses it from dissolution? These
are his words: “Is it,” asks he, “because the soul craves meat and drink, that we suppose
material food passes into it?” Then shortly afterwards he says: “From this circumstance it
is understood and proved, that the sustenance of meat and drink is not wanted for the soul,
but for the body: for which clothing also, in addition to food, is provided in like manner;
so that the supplying of food seems to be necessary to that nature, which is also fitted for
wearing clothes.” This opinion of his he expounds clearly enough; but he adds some illustrative
similes, and says: “Now what do we suppose the occupier of a house does on an inspection
of his dwelling? If he observe the tenement has a shaky roof, or a nodding wall, or
a weak foundation, does he not fetch girders and build up buttresses, in order that he may
succeed in propping up by his care and diligence the fabric which threatened to fall, so that
in the dangerous plight of the residence the peril which evidently overhung the occupier
might be warded off? From this simile,” says he, “see how the soul craves for its flesh, from
which it undoubtedly conceives the craving itself.” Such are the very lucid and adequate
words in which this young person has explained his ideas: he asserts that it is not the soul,
but the body, which requires food; out of a careful regard, no doubt, of the former for the
latter, as one that occupies a dwelling-house, and by a prudent repair prevents the downfall
with which the fleshly tenement was threatened. Well, now, let him go on to explain to you
what probable ruin this particular soul of the rich man was so eager to prevent by propping
up, seeing that it no longer possessed a mortal body, and yet suffered thirst, and begged for
the drop of water from the poor man’s finger. Here is a good knotty question for this astute
instructor of elderly men to exercise himself on; let him inquire, and find a solution if he

<head>Chapter 9 <del>V.</del>—How Could the Incorporeal God Breathe Out of Himself a Corporeal
Substance?</head>
<p>In that he believes God to be truly incorporeal, I congratulate him that herein, at all
events, he has kept himself uninfluenced by the ravings of Tertullian. For he insisted, that
as the soul is corporeal, so likewise is God.2407 It is therefore specially surprising that our
author, who differs from Tertullian in this point, yet labours to persuade us that the incorporeal
God does not make the soul out of nothing, but exhales it as a corporeal breath out
of Himself. What a wonderful learning that must be to which every age erects its attentive
ears, and which contrives to gain for its disciples men of advanced years, and even presbyters!
Let this eminent man read what he has written, read it in public; let him invite to hear the
reading well-known persons and unknown ones, learned and unlearned. Old men, assemble
with your younger instructors; learn what you used to know nothing about; hear now what
you had never heard before. Behold, according to the teaching of this scribe, God creates a
breath, not out of something else which exists in some way or other, and not out of that
which absolutely has no existence; but out of that which He is Himself, perfectly incorporeal,
He breathes a body so that He actually changes His own incorporeal nature into a body,
before it undergoes the change into the body of sin. Does he say, that He does not change
something out of His own nature, when He creates breath? Then, of course, He does not
make that breath out of Himself: for He is not Himself one thing, and His nature another
thing. What is this insane man thinking of? But if he says that God creates breath out of His
own nature in such a way as to remain absolutely entire Himself, this is not the question.
The question is, whether that which comes not of some previously created substance, nor
from nothing, but from Him, is not what He is, that is, of the same nature and essence? Now
He remains absolutely entire after the generation of His Son; but because He begat Him of
His own nature, He did not beget a something which was different from that which He is
Himself. For, putting to one side the circumstance that the Word took on Himself a human
nature and became flesh, the Word who is the Son of God is another but not another thing:
that is, He is another person but not a different nature. And whence does this come to pass,
except from the fact that He is not created out of something else, or out of nothing, but was
begotten out of Himself; not that He might be better than He was, but that He might be altogether
even what He is of whom He is begotten; that is, of one and the same nature, equal,
co-eternal, in every way like, equally unchangeable, equally invisible, equally incorporeal,
equally God; in a word, that He might be altogether what the Father is, except that He actually
is Himself the Son, and not the Father? But if He remains Himself the same God entire and
unimpaired, but yet creates something different from Himself, and worse than Himself, not

out of nothing, nor out of some other creature, but out of His very self; and that something
emanates as a body out ofthe incorporeal God; then God forbid that a catholic should imbibe

human mind.</p>

<head>Chapter 10 <del>VI.</del>—Children May Be Found of Like or of Unlike Dispositions with
Their Parents.</head>
<p>Then, again, how ineptly he labours to free the soul, which he supposes to be corporeal,
from the passions of the body, raising questions about the soul’s infancy; about the soul’s
emotions, when paralysed and oppressed; about the amputation of bodily limbs, without
cutting or dividing the soul. But in dealing with such points as these, my duty is to treat
rather with him than with you; it is for him to labour to assign a reason for all he says. In
this way we shall not seem to wish to be too importunate with an elderly man’s gravity on
the subject of a young man’s work. As to the similarity of disposition to the parents which
is discovered in their children, he does not dispute its coming from the soul’s seed. Accordingly,
this is the opinion also of those persons who do away with the soul’s propagation; but
the opposite party who entertain this theory do not place on this the weight of their assertion.
For they observe also that children are unlike their parents in disposition; and the reason
of this, as they suppose, is, that one and the same person very often has various dispositions
himself, unlike each other,—not, of course, that he has received another soul, but that his
life has undergone a change for the better or for the worse. So they say that there is no impossibility
in a soul’s not possessing the same disposition which he had by whom it was
propagated, seeing that the selfsame soul may have different dispositions at different times.
If, therefore, you think that you have learnt this of him, that the soul does not come to us
by natural transmission at birth,—I only wish that you had discovered from him the truth
of the case,—I would with the greatest pleasure resign myself to your hands to learn the
whole truth. But really to learn is one thing, and to seem to yourself to have learned is another
thing. If, then, you suppose that you have learned what you still are ignorant of, you
have evidently not learnt, but given a random credence to a pleasant hearsay. Falsity has
stolen over you in the suavity.2408 Now I do not say this from feeling as yet any certainty as
to the proposition being false, which asserts that souls are created afresh by God’s inbreathing
rather than derived from the parents at birth; for I think that this is a point which still requires
proof from those who find themselves able to teach it. No; my reason for saying it is, that
this person has discussed the whole subject in such a way as not only not to solve the point
still in dispute, but even to indulge in statements which leave no doubt as to their falsity. In
his desire to prove things of doubtful import, he has boldly stated things which undoubtedly
merit reprobation.</p>

<head>Chapter 11 <del>VII.</del>—Victor Implies that the Soul Had a “State” And “Merit” Before
Incarnation.</head>
<p>Would you hesitate yourself to reprobate what he has said concerning the soul? “You
will not have it,” he says, “that the soul contracts from the sinful flesh the health, to which
holy state you can see it in due course pass by means of the flesh, so as to amend its state
through that by which it had lost its merit? Or is it because baptism washes the body that
what is believed to be conferred by baptism does not pass on to the soul or spirit? It is only
right, therefore, that the soul should, by means of the flesh, repair that old condition which
it had seemed to have gradually lost through the flesh, in order that it may begin a regenerate
state by means of that whereby it had deserved to be polluted.”2409 Now, do observe how
grave an error this teacher has fallen into! He says that “the soul repairs its condition by
means of the flesh through which it had lost its merit.” The soul, then, must have possessed
some state and some good merit previous to the flesh, which he would have that it recovers
through the flesh, when the flesh is cleansed in the laver of regeneration. Therefore, previous
to the flesh, the soul had lived somewhere in a good state and merit, which state and merit
it lost when it came into the flesh. His words are, “that the soul repairs by means of the flesh
that primitive condition which it had seemed to have gradually lost through the flesh.” The
soul, then, possessed before the flesh, an ancient condition (for his term “primitive” describes
the antiquity of the state); and what could that ancient condition have possibly been, but a
blessed and laudable state? Now, he avers that this happiness is recovered through the sacrament
of baptism, although he will not admit that the soul derives its origin through
propagation from that soul which was once manifestly happy in paradise. How is it, then,
that in another passage he says that “he constantly affirms of the soul that it exists not by
propagation, nor comes out of nothing, nor exists by its own self, nor previous to the body”?
You see how in this place he insists that souls do exist prior to the body somewhere or other,
and that in so happy a state that the same happiness is restored to them by means of baptism.
But, as if forgetful of his own views, he goes on to speak of its “beginning a regenerate state
by means of that,” meaning the flesh, “whereby it had deserved to be polluted.” In a previous
statement he had indicated some good desert which had been lost by means of the flesh;
now, however, he speaks of some evil desert, by means of which it had happened that the
soul had to come, or be sent, into the flesh; for his words are, “By which it had deserved to
be polluted;” and if it deserved to be polluted, its merits could not, of course, have been
good. Pray let him tell us what sin it had committed previous to its pollution by the flesh,
in consequence of which it merited such pollution by the flesh. Let him, if he can, explain
to us a matter which is utterly beyond his power, because it is certainly far above his reach
to discover what to tell us on this subject which shall be true.</p>

<p>He also says some time afterwards: “The soul therefore, if it deserved to be sinful, although
it could not have been sinful, yet did not remain in sin; because, as it was prefigured
in Christ, it was bound not to be in a sinful state, even as it was unable to be.”2410 Now, my
brother, do you, I ask, really think thus? At any rate, have you formed such an opinion, after
having read and duly considered his words, and after having reflected upon what extorted
from you praise during his reading, and the expression of your gratitude after he had ended?
I pray you, tell me what this means: “Although the soul deserved to be sinful, which could
not have been sinful.” What mean his phrases, deserved and could not? For it could not
possibly have deserved its alleged fate, unless it had been sinful; nor would it have been,
unless it could have been, sinful,—so as, by committing sin previous to any evil desert, it
might make for itself a position whence it might, under God’s desertion, advance to the
commission of other sins. When he said, “which could not have been sinful,” did he mean,
which would not have been able to be sinful, unless it came in the flesh? But how did it deserve
a mission at all into a state where it could be sinful, when it could not possibly have
become capable of sinning anywhere else, unless it entered that particular state? Let him,
then, tell us how it so deserved. For if it deserved to become capable of sinning, it must
certainly have already committed some sin, in consequence of which it deserved to be sinful
again. These points, however, may perhaps appear to be obscure, or may be tauntingly said
to be of such a character, but they are really most plain and clear. The truth is, he ought not
to have said that “the soul deserved to become sinful through the flesh,” when he will never
be able to discover any desert of the soul, either good or bad, previous to its being in the
flesh.</p>

<p>Let us now go on to plainer matters. For while he was confined within these great straits,
as to how souls can be held bound by the chain of original sin, when they derive not their
origin from the soul which first sinned, but the Creator breathes them afresh at every birth
into sinful flesh,—pure from all contagion and propagation of sin:—in order that he might
avoid the objection being brought against his argument, that thus God makes them guilty
by such insufflation, he first of all had recourse to the theory drawn from God’s prescience,
that “He had provided redemption for them.” Infants are by the sacrament of this redemption
baptized, so that the original sin which they contracted from the flesh is washed away, as if
God were remedying His own acts for having made these souls polluted. But afterwards,
when he comes to speak of those who receive no such assistance, but expire before they are
baptized, he says: “In this place I do not offer myself as an authority, but I present you with
an example by way of conjecture. We say, then, that some such method as this must be had
recourse to in the case of infants, who, being predestinated for baptism, are yet, by the failing
of this life, hurried away before they are born again in Christ. We read,” adds he, “it written
of such, Speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding,
or deceit beguile his soul. Therefore He hasted to take him away from among the wicked,
for his soul pleased the Lord; and, being made perfect in a short time, he fulfilled a long
time.”2411 Now who would disdain having such a teacher as this? Is it the case, then, with
infants, whom people usually wish to have baptized, even hurriedly, before they die, that,
if they should be detained ever so short a time in this life, that they might be baptized, and
then at once die, wickedness would alter their understanding, and deceit beguile their soul;
and to prevent this happening to them, a hasty death came to their rescue, so that they were
suddenly taken away before they were baptized? By their very baptism, then, they were
changed for the worse, and beguiled by deceit, if it was after baptism that they were snatched
away. O excellent teaching, worthy to be admired and closely followed! But he presumed
greatly on the prudence of all you who were present at his reading, and especially on yours,
to whom he addressed this treatise and handed it after the reading, in supposing that you
would believe that the scripture he quoted was intended for the case of unbaptized infants,
although it was written of the immature ages of all those saints whom foolish men deem to
be hardly dealt with, whenever they are suddenly removed from the present life and are not
permitted to attain to the years which people covet for themselves as a great gift of God.
What, however, is the meaning of these words of his: “Infants predestinated for baptism,
who are yet, by the failing of this life, hurried away before they are born again in Christ,” as
if some power of fortune, or fate, or anything else you please, did not permit God to fulfil
what He had fore-ordained? And how is it that He hurries them Himself away, when they

hinder the accomplishment of the very thing which He has predestinated?</p>

<head>Chapter 14 <del>X.</del>—Victor Sends Those Infants Who Die Unbaptized to Paradise and
the Heavenly Mansions, But Not to the Kingdom of Heaven.</head>
<p>But I beg you mark how bold he is, who is displeased with hesitancy, which prefers to
be cautious rather than overknowing in a question so profound as this: “I would be bold to
say”—such are his words—“that they can attain to the forgiveness of their original sins, yet
not so as to be admitted into the kingdom of heaven. Just as in the case of the thief on the
cross, who confessed but was not baptized, the Lord did not give him the kingdom of
heaven, but paradise; 2412 the words remaining accordingly in full force, ‘Except a man be
born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.’2413
This is especially true, inasmuch as the Lord acknowledges that in His Father’s house are
many mansions,2414 by which are indicated the many different merits of those who dwell
in them; so that in these abodes the unbaptized is brought to forgiveness, and the baptized
to the reward which by grace has been prepared for him.” You observe how the man keeps
paradise and the mansions of the Father’s house distinct from the kingdom of heaven, so
that even unbaptized persons may have an abundant provision in places of eternal happiness.
Nor does he see, when he says all this, that he is so unwilling to distinguish the future abode
of a baptized infant from the kingdom of heaven as to have no fear in keeping distinct
therefrom the very house of God the Father, or the several parts thereof. For the Lord Jesus
did not say: In all the created universe, or in any portion of that universe, but, “In my
Father’s house, are many mansions.” But in what way shall an unbaptized person live in the
house of God the Father, when he cannot possibly have God for his Father, except he be
born again? He should not be so ungrateful to God, who has vouchsafed to deliver him from
the sect of the Donatists or Rogatists, as to aim at dividing the house of God the Father, and
to put one portion of it outside the kingdom of heaven, where the unbaptized may be able
to dwell. And on what terms does he himself presume that he is to enter into the kingdom
of heaven, when from that kingdom he excludes the house of the King Himself, in what part
soever He pleases? From the case, however, of the thief who, when crucified at the Lord’s
side, put his hope in the Lord who was crucified with him, and from the case of Dinocrates,
the brother of St. Perpetua, he argues that even to the unbaptized may be given the remission
of sins and an abode with the blessed; as if any one unbelief in whom would be a sin, had
shown him that the thief and Dinocrates had not been baptized. Concerning these cases,
however, I have more fully explained my views in the book which I wrote to our brother

<head>Chapter 15 <del>XI.</del>—Victor “Decides” That Oblations Should Be Offered Up for Those
Who Die Unbaptized.</head>
<p>Still he chafes with indecision, and is well-nigh suffocated in the terrible straits of his
theory; for very likely he descries with a more sensitive eye than you, the amount of evil
which he enunciates, to the effect that original sin in infants is effaced without Christ’s sacrament
of baptism. It is, indeed, for the purpose of finding an escape to some extent, and
tardily, in the Church’s sacraments that he says: “In their behalf I most certainly decide that
constant oblations and incessant sacrifices must be offered up on the part of the holy priests.”
Well, then, you may take him if you like for your arbiter, if it were not enough to have him
as your instructor. Let him decide that you must offer up the sacrifice of Christ’s body even
for those who have not been incorporated into Christ. Now this is quite a novel idea, and
foreign to the Church’s discipline and the rule of truth: and yet, when daring to propound
it in his books, he does not modestly say, I rather think; he does not say, I suppose; he does
not say, I am of opinion; nor does he say, I at least would suggest, or mention;—but he says,
I give it as my decision; so that, should we be (as might be likely) offended by the novelty
or the perverseness of his opinion, we might be overawed by the authority of his judicial
determination. It is your own concern, my brother, how to be able to bear him as your instructor
in these views. Catholic priests, however, of right feeling (and among them you
ought to take your place) could never keep quiet—God forbid it—and hear this man pronounce
his decisions, when they would wish him rather to recover his senses, and be sorry
both for having entertained such opinions, and for having gone so far as to commit them
to writing, and chastise himself with the most wholesome discipline of repentance. “Now
it is,” says he; “on this example of the Maccabees who fell in battle that I ground the necessity
of doing this. When they offered stealthily some interdicted sacrifices, and after they had
fallen in the battle, we find,” says he, “that this remedial measure was at once resorted to by
the priests,—sacrifices were offered up to liberate their souls, which had been bound by the
guilt of their forbidden conduct.”2416 But he says all this, as if (according to his reading of
the story) those atoning sacrifices were offered up for uncircumcised persons, as he has decided
that these sacrifices of ours must be offered up for unbaptized persons. For circumcision
was the sacrament of that period, which prefigured the baptism of our day.</p>

and the Kingdom of Heaven After Their Resurrection, Although He Admits that
This Opposes Christ’s Statement.</head>
<p>But your friend, in comparison with what he has shown himself to be further on, thus
far makes mistakes which one may somewhat tolerate. He apparently felt some disposition
to relent; not, to be sure, at what he ought to have misgivings about, namely, for having
ventured to assert that original sin is relaxed even in the case of the unbaptized, and that
remission is given to them of all their sins, so that they are admitted into paradise, that is,
to a place of great happiness, and possess a claim to the happy mansions in our Father’s
house; but he seems to have entertained some regret at having conceded to them abodes of
lesser blessedness outside the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly he goes on to say, “Or if any
one is perhaps reluctant to believe that paradise is bestowed as a temporary and provisional
gift on the soul of the thief or of Dinocrates (for there remains for them still, in the resurrection,
the reward of the kingdom of heaven), although that principal passage stands in the
way,2417—‘Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the
kingdom of God.’2418—he may yet hold my assent as ungrudgingly given to this point; only
let him magnify2419 both the aim and the effect of the divine compassion and fore-knowledge.”
These words have I copied, as I read them in his second book. Well, now, could any
one have shown on this erroneous point greater boldness, recklessness, or presumption?
He actually quotes and calls attention to the Lord’s weighty sentence, encloses it in a statement
of his own, and then says, “Although the opinion is opposed to the ‘principal passage,’ ‘Except
a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of God;’”
he dares then to lift his haughty head in censure against the Prince’s judgment: “He may
yet hold my assent as ungrudgingly given to this point;” and he explains his point to be, that
the souls of unbaptized persons have a claim to paradise as a temporary gift; and in this
class he mentions the dying thief and Dinocrates, as if he were prescribing, or rather prejudging,
their destination; moreover, in the resurrection, he will have them transferred to
a better provision, even making them receive the reward of the kingdom of heaven. “Although,”
says he, “this is opposed to the sentence of the Prince.” Now, do you, my brother,
I pray you, seriously consider this question: What sentence of the Prince shall that man deserve
to have passed upon him, who imposes on any person an assent of his own which runs
counter to the authority of the Prince Himself?</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Disobedient Compassion and Compassionate Disobedience Reprobated.
Martyrdom in Lieu of Baptism.</head>
<p>The new-fangled Pelagian heretics have been most justly condemned by the authority
of catholic councils and of the Apostolic See, on the ground of their having dared to give to
unbaptized infants a place of rest and salvation, even apart from the kingdom of heaven.
This they would not have dared to do, if they did not deny their having original sin, and the
need of its remission by the sacrament of baptism. This man, however, professes the catholic
belief on this point, admitting that infants are tied in the bonds of original sin, and yet he
releases them from these bonds without the laver of regeneration, and after death, in his
compassion, he admits them into paradise; while, with a still ampler compassion, he introduces
them after the resurrection even to the kingdom of heaven. Such compassion did Saul
see fit to assume when he spared the king whom God commanded to be slain;2420 deservedly,
however, was his disobedient compassion, or (if you prefer it) his compassionate disobedience,
reprobated and condemned, that man may be on his guard against extending mercy
to his fellow-man, in opposition to the sentence of Him by whom man was made. Truth,
by the mouth of Itself incarnate, proclaims as if in a voice of thunder: “Except a man be
born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”2421 And
in order to except martyrs from this sentence, to whose lot it has fallen to be slain for the
name of Christ before being washed in the baptism of Christ, He says in another passage,
“He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.”2422 And so far from promising the abolition
of original sin to any one who has not been regenerated in the laver of Christian faith, the
apostle exclaims, “By the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation.”2423
And as a counterbalance against this condemnation, the Lord exhibits the help of His salvation
alone, saying, “He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth
not shall be damned.”2424 Now the mystery of this believing in the case of infants is completely
effected by the response of the sureties by whom they are taken to baptism; and unless
this be effected, they all pass by the offence of one into condemnation. And yet, in opposition
to such clear declarations uttered by the Truth, forth marches before all men a vanity which
is more foolish than pitiful, and says: Not only do infants not pass into condemnation,
though no laver of Christian faith absolves them from the chain of original sin, but they
even after death have an intermediate enjoyment of the felicities of paradise, and after the
resurrection they shall possess even the happiness of the kingdom of heaven. Now, would

<head>Chapter 18 <del>XIII.</del>—Victor’s Dilemma and Fall.</head>
<p>For he is hemmed in within terrible straits by those who make the natural inquiry: “Why
has God visited on the soul so unjust a punishment as to have willed to relegate it into a
body of sin, since by its consorting with the flesh that began to be sinful, which else could
not have been sinful?” For, of course, they say: “The soul could not have been sinful, if God
had not commingled it in the participation of sinful flesh.” Well, this opponent of mine was
unable to discover the justice of God’s doing this, especially in consequence of the eternal
damnation of infants who die without the remission of original sin by baptism; and his inability
was equally great in finding out why the good and righteous God both bound the
souls of infants, who He foresaw would derive no advantage from the sacrament of Christian
grace, with the chain of original sin, by sending them into the body which they derive from
Adam,—the souls themselves being free from all taint of propagation,—and by this means
also made them amenable to eternal damnation. No less was he unwilling to admit that
these very souls likewise derived their sinful origin from that one primeval soul. And so he
preferred escaping by a miserable shipwreck of faith, rather than to furl his sails and steady
his oars, in the voyage of his controversy, and by such prudent counsel check the fatal
rashness of his course. Worthless in his youthful eye was our aged caution; just as if this
most troublesome and perilous question of his was more in need of a torrent of eloquence
than the counsel of prudence. And this was foreseen even by himself, but to no purpose;
for, as if to set forth the points which were objected to him by his opponents, he says: “After
them other reproachful censures are added to the querulous murmurings of those who rail
against us; and, as if tossed about in a whirlwind, we are dashed repeatedly among huge
rocks.” After saying this, he propounded for himself the very dangerous question, which
we have already treated, wherein he has wrecked the catholic faith, unless by a real repentance
he shall have repaired the faith which he had shattered. That whirlwind and those rocks I
have myself avoided, unwilling to entrust my frail barque to their dangers; and when writing
on this subject I have expressed myself in such a way as rather to explain the grounds of my
hesitancy, than to exhibit the rashness of presumption.2425 This little work of mine excited
his derision, when he met with it at your house, and in utter recklessness he flung himself
upon the reef: he showed more spirit than wisdom in his conduct. To what lengths, however,
that over-confidence of his led him, I suppose that you can now yourself perceive. But I give
heartier thanks to God, since you even before this descried it. For all the while he was refusing
to check his headlong career, when the issue of his course was still in doubt, he alighted on
his miserable enterprise, and maintained that God, in the case of infants who died without

<head>Chapter 19 <del>XIV.</del>—Victor Relies on Ambiguous Scriptures.</head>
<p>The passages of Scripture, indeed, which he has adduced in the attempt to prove from
them that God did not derive human souls by propagation from the primitive soul, but as
in that first instance that He formed them by breathing them into each individual, are so
uncertain and ambiguous, that they can with the utmost facility be taken in a different sense
from that which he would assign to them. This point I have already demonstrated2426 with
sufficient clearness, I think in the book which I addressed to that friend o ours, of whom I
have made mention above. The passages which he has used for his proofs inform us that
God gives, or makes, or fashion men’s souls; but whence He gives them, or of what He makes
or fashions them, they tell us nothing: they leave untouched the question whether it be by
propagation from the first soul or by insufflation, like the first soul. This writer however,
simply because he reads that God “giveth” souls,2427 “hath made” souls, “formeth” souls,
supposes that these phrases amount to a denial of the propagation of souls; whereas, by the
testimony of the same scripture, God gives men their bodies, or makes them, or fashions
and forms them; although no one doubts that the said bodies are given, made, and formed
by Him by seminal propagation.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Victor Quotes Scriptures for Their Silence, and Neglects the Biblical
Usage.</head>
<p>As for the passage which affirms that “God hath made of one blood all nations of
men,”2428 and that in which Adam says, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh,”2429 inasmuch as it is not said in the one, “of one soul,” and in the other, “soul of my
soul,” he supposes that it is denied that children’s souls come from their parents, or the first
woman’s from her husband just as if, forsooth, had the sentence run in the way suggested,
“of one soul,” instead of “of one blood,” anything else than the whole human being could
be understood, without any denial of the propagation of the body. So likewise, if it had been
said, “soul of my soul,” the flesh would not be denied, of course, which evidently had been
taken out of the man. Constantly does Holy Scripture indicate the whole by a part, and a
part by the whole. For certainly, if in the passage which this man has quoted as his proof it
had been said that the human race had been made, not “of one blood,” but “of one man,”
it could not have prejudiced the opinion of those who deny the propagation of souls, although
man is not soul alone, nor only flesh, but both. For they would have their answer ready to
this effect, that the Scripture here might have meant to indicate a part by the whole, that is
to say, the flesh only by the entire human being. In like manner, they who maintain the
propagation of souls contend that in the passage where it is said, “of one blood,” the human
being is implied by the term “blood,” on the principle of the whole being expressed by a
part. For just as the one party seems to be assisted by the expression, “of one blood,” instead
of the phrase, “of one man,” so the other side evidently gets countenance from the statement
being so plainly written, “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned,”2430 instead of its being said, “in whom
the flesh of all sinned.” Similarly, as one party seems to receive assistance from the fact that
Scripture says, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,” on the ground that a
part covers the whole; so, again, the other side derives some advantage from what is written
in the immediate sequel of the passage, “She shall be called woman, because she was taken
out of her husband.” For, according to their contention, the latter clause should have run,
“Because her flesh was taken out of her husband,” if it was not true that the entire woman,
soul and all, but only her flesh, was taken out of man. The fact, however, of the whole matter
is simply this, that after hearing both sides, anybody whose judgment is free from party
prejudice sees at once that loose quotation is unavailing in this controversy; for against one
party, which maintains the opinion of the propagation of souls, those passages must not be
adduced which mention only a part, inasmuch as the Scripture might mean by the part to
<note type="footnote">2428 Acts xvii. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">2429 Gen. ii. 23.</note>

imply the whole in all such passages; as, for instance, when we read, “The Word was made
flesh,”2431 we of course understand not the flesh only, but the entire human being; nor
against the other party, who deny this doctrine of the soul’s propagation, is it of any avail
to quote those passages which do not mention a part of the human being, but the whole;
because in these the Scripture might possibly mean to imply a part by the whole; as we
confess that Christ was buried, whereas it was only His flesh that was laid in the sepulchre.
We therefore say, that on such grounds there is no ground on the one hand for rashly constructing,
nor on the other hand for, with equal rashness, demolishing the theory of
propagation; but we add this advice, that other passages be duly looked out, such as admit
of no ambiguity.2432</p>

<head>Chapter 21 <del>XV.</del>—Victor’s Perplexity and Failure.</head>
<p>For these reasons I fail thus far to discover what this instructor has taught you, and what
grounds you have for the gratitude you have lavished upon him. For the question remains
just as it was, which inquires about the origin of souls, whether God gives, forms, and makes
them for men by propagating them from that one soul which He breathed into the first
man, or whether it is by His own inbreathing that He does this in every case, as He did for
the first man. For that God does form, and make, and bestow souls on men, the Christian
faith does not hesitate to aver. Now, when this person endeavoured to solve the question
without gauging his own resources, by denying the propagation of souls, and asserting that
the Creator inbreathed them into men pure from all contagion of sin,—not out of nothing,
but out of Himself,—He dishonoured the very nature of God by opprobriously attributing
mutability to it, an imputation which was necessarily untenable. Then, desirous of avoiding
all implication which might lead to God’s being deemed unrighteous, if He ties with the
bond of original sin souls which are pure of all actual sin, although not redeemed by Christian
regeneration, he has given utterance to words and sentiments which I only wish he had
not taught you. For he has accorded to unbaptized infants such happiness and salvation as
even the Pelagian heresy could not have ventured on doing. And yet for all this, when the
question touches the many thousands of infants who are born of the ungodly, and die among
the ungodly,—I do not mean those whom charitable persons are unable to assist by baptism,
however desirous of doing so, but those of whose baptism nobody either has been able or
shall be able to think, and for whom no one has offered or is likely to offer the sacrifice
which, as this instructor of yours thought, ought to be offered even for those who have not
been baptized,2433—he has discovered no means of solving it. If he were questioned concerning
them, what their souls deserved that God should involve them in sinful flesh to incur
eternal damnation, never to be washed in the laver of baptism, nor atoned for by the sacrifice
of Christ’s body and blood, he will then either feel himself at an utter loss, and so will regard
our hesitation with a real, though tardy favour; or else will determine that Christ’s body
must be offered for all those infants which all the world over die without Christian baptism
(their names having been never heard of, since they are unknown in the Church of Christ),
although not incorporated into the body of Christ.</p>

<p>Far be it from you, my brother, that such views should be pleasant to you, or that you
should either feel pleasure in having acquired them, or presume ever to teach them. Otherwise,
even he would be a far better man than yourself. Because at the commencement of his
first book he has prefixed the following modest and humble preface: “Though I desire to
comply with your request, I am only affording a clear proof of my presumption.” And a
little further on he says,2434 “Inasmuch as I am, indeed, by no means confident of being
able to prove what I may have advanced; and moreover I should always be anxious not to
insist on any opinion of my own, if it is found to be an improbable one; and it would be my
hearty desire, in case my own judgment is condemned, earnestly to follow better and truer
views. For as it shows evidence of the best intention, and a laudable purpose, to permit
yourself to be easily led to truer views of a subject; so it betokens an obstinate and depraved
mind to refuse to turn quickly aside into the pathway of reason.” Now, as he said all this
sincerely, and still feels as he spoke, he no doubt entertains a very hopeful feeling about a
right issue. In similar strain he concludes his second book: “You must not think,” says he,
“that there is any chance of its ever recoiling invidiously against you, that I constitute you
the judge of my words. And lest by chance the sharp eye of some inquisitive reader may
have opportunity of turning up and encountering any possible vestiges of elemental error
which may be left behind on my illegal sheets, I beg you to tear up page after page with unsparing
hand, if need be; and after expending on me your critical censure, punish me further,
by smearing out the very ink which has given form to my worthless words; so that, having

when you see anything to amend, you offend against love; but if he does not appear
to you to require correction, because you think him to be right in his opinions, then you
are wise against truth. He, therefore, is a better man (since he is only too ready to be corrected,
if a true censurer be at hand) than yourself, if either knowing him to be in error you despise
him with derision, or ignorant of his wandering course you at the same time closely follow
his error. Everything, therefore, which you find in the books that he has addressed and forwarded
to you, I beg you to consider with sobriety and vigilance; and you will perhaps make
fuller discoveries than I have myself of statements which deserve to be censured. And as for
such of their contents as are worthy of praise and approbation,—whatever good you have
learnt therein, and by his instruction, which perhaps you were really ignorant of before, tell
us plainly what it is, that all may know that it was for this particular benefit that you expressed
your obligations to him, and not for the manifold statements in his books which call for
their disapproval,—all, I mean, who, like yourself, heard him read his writings, or who afterwards
read the same for themselves: lest in his ornate style they may drink poison, as out
of a choice goblet, at your instance, though not after your own example, because they know
not precisely what it is you have drunk yourself, and what you have left untasted, and because,
from your high character, they suppose that whatever is drunk out of this fountain would
be for their health. For what else are hearing, and reading, and copiously depositing things
in the memory, than several processes of drinking? The Lord, however, foretold concerning
His faithful followers, that even “if they should drink any deadly thing, it should not hurt
them.”2436 And thus it happens that they who read with judgment, and bestow their approbation
on whatever is commendable according to the rule of faith, and disapprove of things
which ought to be reprobated, even if they commit to their memory statements which are
declared to be worthy of disapproval, they receive no harm from the poisonous and depraved
nature of the sentences. To myself, through the Lord’s mercy, it can never become a matter
of the least regret, that, actuated by our previous love, I have given your reverend and religious
self advice and warning on these points, in whatever way you may receive the admonition

<p>ADDRESSED TO VINCENTIUS VICTOR.</p>
<p>Augustin points out to Vincentius Victor the corrections which he ought to make in his books
concerning the origin of the soul, if he wishes to be a Catholic. Those opinions also which
had been already refuted in the preceding books addressed to Renatus and Peter, Augustin
briefly censures in this third book, which is written to Victor himself: moreover, he classifies
them under eleven heads of error.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—Augustin’s Purpose in Writing.</head>
<p>As to that which I have thought it my duty to write to you, my much-loved son Victor,
I would have you to entertain this above all other thoughts in your mind, if I seemed to
despise you, that it was certainly not my intention to do so. At the same time I must beg of
you not to abuse our condescension in such a way as to suppose that you possess my approval
merely because you have not my contempt. For it is not to follow, but to correct you, that
I give you my love; and since I by no means despair of the possibility of your amendment,
I do not want you to be surprised at my inability to despise the man who has my love. Now,
since it was my bounden duty to love you before you had united with us, in order that you
might become a catholic; how much more ought I now to love you since your union with
us, to prevent your becoming a new heretic, and that you may become so firm a catholic
that no heretic may be able to withstand you! So far as appears from the mental endowments
which God has largely bestowed upon you, you would be undoubtedly a wise man if you
only did not believe that you were one already, and begged of Him who maketh men wise,
with a pious, humble, and earnest prayer, that you might become one, and preferred not to
be led astray with error rather than to be honoured with the flattery of those who go astray.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—Why Victor Assumed the Name of Vincentius. The Names of Evil
Men Ought Never to Be Assumed by Other Persons.</head>
<p>The first thing which caused me some anxiety about you was the title which appeared
in your books with your name; for on inquiring of those who knew you, and were probably
your associates in opinion, who Vincentius Victor was, I found that you had been a
Donatist, or rather a Rogatist, but had lately come into communion with the catholic Church.
Now, while I was rejoicing, as one naturally does at the recovery of those whom he sees
rescued from that system of error,—and in your case my joy was all the greater because I
saw that your ability, which so much delighted me in your writings, had not remained behind
with the enemies of truth,—additional information was given me by your friends which
caused me sorrow amid my joy, to the effect that you wished to have the name Vincentius
prefixed to your own name, inasmuch as you still held in affectionate regard the successor
of Rogatus, who bore this name, as a great and holy man, and that for this reason you wished
his name to become your surname. Some persons also told me that you had, moreover,
boasted about his having appeared in some sort of a vision to you, and assisted you in
composing those books the subject of which I have discussed with you in this small work
of mine, and to such an extent as to dictate to you himself the precise topics and arguments
which you were to write about. Now, if all this be true, I no longer wonder at your having
been able to make those statements which, if you will only lend a patient ear to my admonition,
and with the attention of a catholic duly consider and weigh those books, you will
undoubtedly come to regret having ever advanced. For he who, according to the apostle’s
portrait, “transforms himself into an angel of light,”2437 has transformed himself before you
into a shape which you believe to have been, or still to be, an angel of light. In this way, in-
deed, he is less able to deceive catholics when his transformations are not into angels of
light, but into heretics; now, however, that you are a catholic, I should be sorry for you to
be beguiled by him. He will certainly feel torture at your having learnt the truth, and so
much the more in proportion to the pleasure he formerly experienced in having persuaded
you to believe error. With a view, however, to your refraining from loving a dead person,
when the love can neither be serviceable to yourself nor profitable to him, I advise you to
consider for a moment this one point—that he is not, of course, a just and holy man, since
you withdrew yourself from the snares of the Donatists or Rogatists on the score of their
heresy; but if you do think him to be just and holy, you ruin yourself by holding communion
with catholics. You are, indeed, only feigning yourself a catholic if you are in mind the same
as he was on whom you bestow your love; and you are aware how terribly the Scripture has
spoken on this subject: “The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the man who feigns.”2438
<note type="footnote">2437 2 Cor. xi. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">2438 Wisd. i. 5.</note>

<pb n="970"/>
If, however, you are sincere in communicating with us, and do not merely pretend to be a
catholic, how is it that you still love a dead man to such a degree as to be willing even now
to boast of the name of one in whose errors you no longer permit yourself to be held? We
really do not like your having such a surname, as if you were the monument of a dead heretic.
Nor do we like your book to have such a title as we should say was a false one if we read it
on his tomb. For we are sure Vincentius is not Victor, the conqueror, but Victus, the
conquered;—may it be, however, with fruitful effect, even as we wish you to be conquered
by the truth! And yet your thought was an astute and skilful one, when you designated the
books, which you wish us to suppose were dictated to you by his inspiration, by the name
of Vincentius Victor; as much as to intimate that it was rather he than you who wished to
be designated by the victorious appellation, as having been himself the conqueror of error,
by revealing to you what were to be the contents of your written treatise. But of what avail
is all this to you, my son? Be, I pray you, a true catholic, not a feigned one, lest the Holy
Spirit should flee from you, and that Vincentius be unable to profit you at all, into whom
the most malignant spirit of error has transformed himself for the purpose of deceiving you;
for it is from that one that all these evil opinions have proceeded, notwithstanding the artful
fraud which has persuaded you to the contrary. If this admonition shall only induce you to
correct these errors with the humility of a God-fearing man and the peaceful submission of
a catholic, they will be regarded as the mistakes of an over-zealous young man, who is eager
rather to amend them than to persevere in them. But if he shall have by his influence prevailed
on you to contend for these opinions with obstinate perseverance, which God forbid, it will
in such a case be necessary to condemn them and their author as heretical, as is required
by the pastoral and remedial nature of the Church’s charge, to check the dire contagion
before it quietly spreads through the heedless masses, while wholesome correction is neglected,
under the name but without the reality of love.</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>III.</del>—He Enumerates the Errors Which He Desires to Have Amended
in the Books of Vincentius Victor. The First Error.</head>
<p>If you ask me what the particular errors are, you may read what I have written to our
brethren, that servant of God Renatus, and the presbyter Peter, to the latter of whom you
yourself thought it necessary to write the very works of which we are now treating, “in
obedience,” as you allege, “to his own wish and request.” Now, they will, I doubt not, lend
you my treatises for your perusal if you should like it, and even press them upon your attention
without being asked. But be that as it may, I will not miss this present opportunity of
informing you what amendments I desire to have made in these writings of yours, as well
as in your belief. The first is, that you will have it that “The soul was not so made by God
that He made it out of nothing, but out of His own very self.”2439 Here you do not reflect
what the necessary conclusion is, that the soul must be of the nature of God; and you know
very well, of course, how impious such an opinion is. Now, to avoid such impiety as this,
you ought so to say that God is the Author of the soul as that it was made by Him, but not
of Him. For whatever is of Him (as, for instance, His only-begotten Son) is of the self-same
nature as Himself. But, that the soul might not be of the same nature as its Creator, it was
made by Him, but not of Him. Or, then, tell me whence it is, or else confess that it is of
nothing. What do you mean by that expression of yours, “That it is a certain particle of an
exhalation from the nature of God”? Do you mean to say, then, that the exhalation2440 itself
from the nature of God, to which the particle in question belongs, is not of the same nature
as God is Himself? If this be your meaning, then God made out of nothing that exhalation
of which you will have the soul to be a particle. Or, if not out of nothing, pray tell me of
what God made it? If He made it out of Himself, it follows that He is Himself (what should
never be affirmed) the material of which His own work is formed. But you go on to say:
“When however, He made the exhalation or breath out of Himself, He remained at the same
time whole and entire;” just as if the light of a candle did not also remain entire when another
candle is lighted from it, and yet be of the same nature, and not another.</p>

<head>Chapter 4 <del>IV.</del>—Victor’s Simile to Show that God Can Create by Breathing Without
Impartation of His Substance.</head>
<p>“But,” you say, “when we inflate a bag, no portion of our nature or quality is poured
into the bag, while the very breath, by the current of which the filled bag is extended, is
emitted from us without the least diminution of ourselves.” Now, you enlarge and dwell
upon these words of yours, and inculcate the simile as necessary for our understanding how
it is that God, without any injury to His own nature, makes the soul out of His own self, and
how, when it is thus made out of Himself, it is not what Himself is. For you ask: “Is this inflation
of the bag a portion of our own soul? Or do we create human beings when we inflate
bags? Or do we suffer any injury in anything at all when we impart our breath by inflation
on diverse things? But we suffer no injury when we transfer breath from ourselves to anything,
nor do we ever remember experiencing any damage to ourselves from inflating a bag,
the full quality and entire quantity of our breath remaining in us notwithstanding the process.”
Now, however elegant and applicable this simile seems to you, I beg you to consider
how greatly it misleads you. For you affirm that the incorporeal God breathes out a corporeal
soul,—not made out of nothing, but out of Himself,—whereas the breath which we ourselves
emit is corporeal, although of a more subtle nature than our bodies; nor do we exhale it out
of our soul, but out of the air through internal functions in our bodily structure. Our lungs,
like a pair of bellows, are moved by the soul (at the command of which also the other
members of the body are moved), for the purpose of inhaling and exhaling the atmospheric
air. For, besides the aliments, solid or fluid, which constitute our meat and drink, God has
surrounded us with this third aliment of the atmosphere which we breathe; and that with
so good effect, that we can live for some time without meat and drink, but we could not
possibly subsist for a moment without this third aliment, which the air, surrounding us on
all sides, supplies us with as we breathe and respire. And as our meat and drink have to be
not only introduced into the body, but also to be expelled by passages formed for the purpose,
to prevent injury accruing either way (from either not entering or not quitting the body);
so this third airy aliment (not being permitted to remain within us, and thus not becoming
corrupt by delay, but being expelled as soon as it is introduced) has been furnished, not with
different, but with the self-same channels both for its entrance and for its exit, even the
mouth, or the nostrils, or both together.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="973"/>
<head>Chapter 5.—Examination of Victor’s Simile: Does Man Give Out Nothing by
Breathing?</head>
<p>Prove now yourself what I say, for your own satisfaction in your own case; emit breath
by exhalation, and see whether you can continue long without catching back your breath;
then again catch it back by inhalation, and see what discomfort you experience unless you
again emit it. Now, when we inflate a bag, as you prescribe, we do, in fact, the same thing
which we do to maintain life, except that in the case of the artificial experiment our inhalation
is somewhat stronger, in order that we may emit a stronger breath, so as to fill and distend
the bag by compressing the air we blow into it, rather in the manner of a hard puff than of
the gentle process of ordinary breathing and respiration. On what ground, then, do you say,
“We suffer no injury whenever we transfer breath from ourselves to any object, nor do we
ever remember experiencing any damage to ourselves from inflating a bag, the full quality
and entire quantity of our own breath remaining in us notwithstanding the process”? It is
very plain, my son, if ever you have inflated a bag, that you did not carefully observe your
own performance. For you do not perceive what you lose by the act of inflation by reason
of the immediate recovery of your breath. But you can learn all this with the greatest ease
if you would simply prefer doing so to stiffly maintaining your own statements for no other
reason than because you have made them—not inflating the bag, but inflated yourself to
the full, and inflating your hearers (whom you should rather edify and instruct by veritable
facts) with the empty prattle of your turgid discourse. In the present case I do not send you
to any other teacher than your own self. Breathe, then, a good breath into the bag; shut your
mouth instantly, hold tight your nostrils, and in this way discover the truth of what I say to
you. For when you begin to suffer the intolerable inconvenience which accompanies the
experiment, what is it you wish to recover by opening your mouth and releasing your nostrils?
Surely there would be nothing to recover if your supposition be a correct one, that you have
lost nothing whenever you breathe. Observe what a plight you would be in, if by inhalation
you did not regain what you had parted with by your breathing outwards. See, too, what
loss and injury the insufflation would produce, were it not for the repair and reaction caused
by respiration. For unless the breath which you expend in filling the bag should all return
by the re-opened channel to discharge its function of nourishing yourself, what, I wonder,
would be left remaining to you,—I will not say to inflate another bag, but to supply your
very means of living?</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—The Simile Reformed in Accordance with Truth.</head>
<p>Well, now, you ought to have thought of all this when you were writing, and not to have
brought God before our eyes in that favourite simile of yours, of inflated and inflateable
bags, breathing forth souls out of some other nature which was already in existence, just as
we ourselves make our breath from the air which surrounds us; or certainly you should not,
in a manner which is really as diverse from your similitude as it is abundant in impiety, have
represented God as either producing some changeable thing without injury, indeed, to
Himself, but yet out of His own substance; or what is worse, creating it in such wise as to
be Himself the material of His own work. If, however, we are to employ a similitude drawn
from our breathing which shall suitably illustrate this subject, the following one is more
credible: Just as we, whenever we breathe, make a breath, not out of our own nature, but,
because we are not omnipotent, out of that air that surrounds us, which we inhale and discharge
whenever we breathe and respire; and the said breath is neither living nor sentient,
although we are ourselves living and sentient; so God can—not, indeed, out of His own
nature, but (as being so omnipotent as to be able to create whatever He wills) even out of
that which has no existence at all, that is to say, out of nothing—make a breath that is living
and sentient, but evidently mutable, though He be Himself immutable.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>V.</del>—Victor Apparently Gives the Creative Breath to Man Also.</head>
<p>But what is the meaning of that, which you have thought proper to add to this simile,
with regard to the example of the blessed Elisha because he raised the dead by breathing
into his face?2441 Now, do you really suppose that Elisha’s breath was made the soul of the
child? I could not believe that even you could stray so far away from the truth. If, now, that
soul which was taken from the living child so as to cause his death, was itself afterwards restored
to him so as to cause his restoration to life: where, I ask, is the pertinence of your remark
when you say “that no diminution accrued to Elisha,” as if it could be imagined that
anything had been transferred from the prophet to the child to cause his revival? But if you
meant no more than that the prophet breathed and remained entire, where was the necessity
for your saying that of Elisha, when raising the dead child, which you might with no less
propriety say of any one whatever when emitting a breath, and reviving no one? Then, again,
you spoke unadvisedly (though God forbid that you should believe the breath of Elisha to
have become the soul of the resuscitated child!) when you intimated your meaning to be a
desire to keep separate what was first done by God from this that was done by the prophet,
in that the One breathed but once, and the other thrice. These are your words: “Elisha
breathed into the face of the deceased child of the Shunammite, after the manner of the
original creation. And when by the prophet’s breathing a divine force inspired the dead
limbs, reanimated to their original vigour, no diminution accrued to Elisha, through whose
breathing the dead body recovered its revived soul and spirit. Only there is this difference,
the Lord breathed but once into man’s face and he lived, while Elisha breathed three times
into the face of the dead and he lived again.” Thus your words sound as if the number of
the breathings alone made all the difference, why we should not believe that the prophet
actually did what God did. This statement, then, requires to be entirely revised. There was
so complete a difference between that work of God and this of Elisha, that the former
breathed the breath of life whereby man became a living soul, and the latter breathed a
breath which was not itself sentient nor endued with life, but was figurative for the sake of
some signification. The prophet did not really cause the child to live again by giving him
life, but he procured God’s doing that by giving him love.2442 As to what you allege, that he
breathed three times, either your memory, as often happens, or a faulty reading of the text,
must have misled you. Why need I enlarge? You ought not to be seeking for examples and
arguments to establish your point, but rather to amend and change your opinion. I beg of
you neither to believe, nor to say, nor to teach “that God made the human soul not out of
nothing, but out of His own substance,” if you wish to be a catholic.</p>

<p>Do not, I pray you, believe, say, or teach that “Thus is God ever giving souls through
infinite time, just as He who gives is Himself ever existent,” if you wish to be a catholic. For
a time will come when God will not give souls, although He will not therefore Himself cease
to exist. Your phrase, “is ever giving,” might be understood “to give without cessation,” so
long as men are born and get offspring, even as it is said of certain men that they are “ever
learning, and never coming to the knowledge of the truth.”2443 For this term “ever” is not
in this passage taken to mean “never ceasing to learn,” inasmuch as they do cease to learn
when they have ceased to exist in this body, or have begun to suffer the fiery pains of hell.
You, however, did not allow your word to be understood in this sense when you said “is
ever giving,” since you thought that it must be applied to infinite time. And even this was
a small matter; for, as if you had been asked to explain your phrase, “ever giving,” more explicitly,
you went on to say, “just as He is Himself ever existent who gives.” This assertion
the sound and catholic faith utterly condemns. For be it far from us to believe that God is
ever giving souls, just as He is Himself, who gives them, ever existent. He is Himself ever
existent in such a sense as never to cease to exist; souls, however, He will not be ever giving;
but He will beyond doubt cease to give them when the age of generation ceases, and children
are no longer born to whom they are to be given.</p>

<p>Again, do not, I pray you, believe, say, or teach that “the soul deservedly lost something
by the flesh, although it was of good merit previous to the flesh,” if you wish to be a catholic.
For the apostle declares that “children who are not yet born, have done neither good nor
evil.”2444 How, therefore, could their soul, previous to its participation of flesh, have had
anything like good desert, if it had not done any good thing? Will you by any chance venture
to assert that it had, previous to the flesh, lived a good life, when you cannot actually prove
to us that it even existed at all? How, then, can you say: “You will not allow that the soul
contracts health from the sinful flesh; and to this holy state, then, you can see it in due course
pass, with the view of amending its condition, through that very flesh by which it had lost
merit”? Perhaps you are not aware that these opinions, which attribute to the human soul
a good state and a good merit previous to the flesh, have been already condemned by the
catholic Church, not only in the case of some ancient heretics, whom I do not here mention,
but also more recently in the instance of the Priscillianists.</p>

own self which you have exhibited in the next sentence, wherein you said that the soul
through the flesh deservedly recovers its primitive condition, which it had seemed to have
gradually lost through the flesh, in order that it may begin to be regenerated by the very
flesh through which it had deserved to be polluted.” Here you—the very man who had just
before said that the soul repairs its condition through the flesh, by reason of which it had
lost its desert (where nothing but good desert can be meant, which you will have to be recovered
in the flesh, by baptism, of course)—said in another turn of your thought, that
through the flesh the soul had deserved to be polluted (in which statement it is no longer
the good desert, but an evil one, which must be meant). What flagrant inconsistency! but I
will pass it over, and content myself with observing, that it is absolutely uncatholic to believe
that the soul, previous to its incarnate state, deserved either good or evil.</p>

sinful. And, of course, it could not possibly have incurred so bad a desert previous to any
sin, especially prior to its coming into the flesh, when it could have possessed no merit either
way, either evil or good. How, then, can you say: “If, therefore, the soul, which could not be
sinful, deserved to be sinful, it yet did not remain in sin, because as it was prefigured in
Christ it was bound not to be in a sinful state, even as it was unable to be”? Now, just for a
little consider what it is you say, and desist from repeating such a statement. How did the
soul deserve, and how was it unable, to be sinful? How, I pray you tell me, did that deserve
to be sinful which never lived sinfully? How, I ask again, was that made sinful which was
not able to be sinful? Or else, if you mean your phrase, “was unable,” to imply inability apart
from the flesh, how in that case did the soul deserve to be sinful, and by reason of what
desert was it sent into the flesh, when previous to its union with the flesh it was not able to
be sinful, so as to deserve any evil at all?</p>

he might be reckoned among those who are purified by the confession of martyrdom, yet
you cannot tell whether he was not baptized. For, to say nothing of the opinion that he might
have been sprinkled with the water which gushed at the same time with the blood out of
the Lord’s side,2445 as he hung on the cross next to Him, and thus have been washed with
a baptism of the most sacred kind, what if he had been baptized in prison, as in after times
some under persecution were enabled privately to obtain? or what if he had been baptized
previous to his imprisonment? If, indeed, he had been, the remission of his sins which he
would have received in that case from God would not have protected him from the sentence
of public law, so far as appertained to the death of the body. What if, being already baptized,
he had committed the crime and incurred the punishment of robbery and lawlessness, but
yet received, by virtue of repentance added to his baptism, forgiveness of the sins which,
though baptized, he had committed? For beyond doubt his faith and piety appeared to the
Lord clearly in his heart, as they do to us in his words. If, indeed, we were to conclude that
all those who have quitted life without a record of their baptism died unbaptized, we should
calumniate the very apostles themselves; for we are ignorant when they were, any of them,
baptized, except the Apostle Paul.2446 If, however, we could regard as an evidence that they
were really baptized the circumstance of the Lord’s saying to St. Peter, “He that is washed
needeth not save to wash his feet,”2447 what are we to think of the others, of whom we do
not read even so much as this,—Barnabas, Timothy, Titus, Silas, Philemon, the very evangelists
Mark and Luke, and innumerable others, about whose baptism God forbid that we
should entertain any doubt, although we read no record of it? As for Dinocrates, he was a
child of seven years of age; and as children who are baptized so old as that can now recite
the creed and answer for themselves in the usual examination, I know not why he may not
be supposed after his baptism to have been recalled by his unbelieving father to the sacrilege
and profanity of heathen worship, and for this reason to have been condemned to the pains
from which he was liberated at his sister’s intercession. For in the account of him you have
never read, either that he was never a Christian, or died a catechumen. But for the matter

<p>If you wish to be a catholic, do not venture to believe, to say, or to teach that “they whom
the Lord has predestinated for baptism can be snatched away from his predestination, or
die before that has been accomplished in them which the Almighty has predestined.” There
is in such a dogma more power than I can tell assigned to chances in opposition to the power
of God, by the occurrence of which casualties that which He has predestinated is not permitted
to come to pass. It is hardly necessary to spend time or earnest words in cautioning the
man who takes up with this error against the absolute vortex of confusion into which it will
absorb him, when I shall sufficiently meet the case if I briefly warn the prudent man who is
ready to receive correction against the threatening mischief. Now these are your words: “We
say that some such method as this must be had recourse to in the case of infants who, being
predestinated for baptism, are yet, by the failing of this life, hurried away before they are
born again in Christ.” Is it then really true that any who have been predestinated to baptism
are forestalled before they come to it by the failing of this life? And could God predestinate
anything which He either in His foreknowledge saw would not come to pass, or in ignorance
knew not that it could not come to pass, either to the frustration of His purpose or the discredit
of His foreknowledge? You see how many weighty remarks might be made on this
subject; but I am restrained by the fact of having treated on it a little while ago, so that I
content myself with this brief and passing admonition.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—His Eighth Error. (See Above in Book II. 13 <del>IX.</del>.)</head>
<p>Refuse, if you wish to be a catholic, to believe, or to say, or to teach that “it is of infants,
who are forestalled by death before they are born again in Christ, that the Scripture says,
‘Speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit
beguile his soul. Therefore God hastened to take him away from among the wicked; for his
soul pleased the Lord; and being made perfect in a short time he fulfilled long seasons.’”2448
For this passage has nothing to do with those to whom you apply it, but rather belongs to
those who, after they have been baptized and have progressed in pious living, are not permitted
to tarry long on earth,—having been made perfect, not with years, but with the grace
of heavenly wisdom. This error however, of yours, by which you think that this scripture
was spoken of infants who die unbaptized, does an intolerable wrong to the holy laver itself,
if an infant, who could have been “hurried away” after baptism, has been “hurried away”
before this, for this reason:—“lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile
his soul.” As if this “wickedness,” and this “deceit which beguiles the soul,” and changes it
for the worse, if it be not before taken away, is to be believed to be in baptism itself! In a
word, since his soul had pleased God, He hastened to remove him out of the midst of iniquity;
and he tarried not for ever so little while, in order to fulfil in him what He had predestinated;
but preferred to act in opposition to His predestined purpose, and actually hastened lest
what had pleased Him so well in the unbaptized child should be exterminated by his baptism!
As if the dying infant would perish in that, whither we ought to run with him in our arms
in order to save him from perdition. Who, therefore, in respect of these words of the Book
of Wisdom, could believe, or say, or write, or quote them as having been written concerning
infants who die without baptism, if he only reflected upon them with proper consideration?</p>

<p>If you wish to be a catholic, I pray you, neither believe, nor say, nor teach that “there
are some mansions outside the kingdom of God which the Lord said were in His Father’s

Father (apud Patrem meum) many mansions;” although, if He had even expressed Himself
so, the mansions could hardly be supposed to have any other situation than in the house of
His Father; but He plainly says, “In my Father’s house are many mansions.”2449 Now, who
would be so reckless as to separate some parts of God’s house from the kingdom of God; so
that, whilst the kings of the earth are found reigning, not in their house only, nor only in
their own country, but far and wide, even in regions across the sea, the King who made the

<p>You may, however, not improbably contend that all things, it is true, belong to the
kingdom of God, because He reigns in heaven, reigns on earth, in the depths beneath, in
paradise, in hell (for where does He not reign, since His power is everywhere supreme?);
but that the kingdom of heaven is one thing, into which none are permitted to enter, according
to the Lord’s own true and settled sentence, unless they are washed in the laver of regeneration,
while quite another thing is the kingdom over the earth, or over any other parts of
creation, in which there may be some mansions of God’s house; but these, although appertaining
to the kingdom of God, belong not to that kingdom of heaven where God’s kingdom
exists with an especial excellence and blessedness; and that it hence happens that, while no
parts and mansions of God’s house can be rudely separated from the kingdom of God, yet
not all the mansions are prepared in the kingdom of heaven; and still, even in the abodes
which are not situated in the kingdom of heaven, those may live happily, to whom, if they
are even unbaptized, God has willed to assign such habitations. They are no doubt in the
kingdom of God, although (as not having been baptized) they cannot possibly be in the
kingdom of heaven.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
<pb n="986"/>
<head>Chapter 17.—Where the Kingdom of God May Be Understood to Be.</head>
<p>Now, they who say this, do no doubt seem to themselves to say a good deal, because
theirs is only a slight and careless view of Scripture; nor do they understand in what sense
we use the phrase, “kingdom of God,” when we say of it in our prayers, “Thy kingdom
come;”2450 for that is called the kingdom of God, in which His whole family shall reign with
Him in happiness and for ever. Now, in respect of the power which He possesses over all
things, he is of course even now reigning. What, therefore, do we intend when we pray that
His kingdom may come unless that we may deserve to reign with Him? But even they will
be under His power who shall have to suffer the pains of eternal fire. Well, then, do we mean
to predicate of these unhappy beings that they too will be in the kingdom of God? Surely it
is one thing to be honoured with the gifts and privileges of the kingdom of God, and another
thing to be restrained and punished by the laws of the same. However, that you may have
a very manifest proof that on the one hand the kingdom of heaven must not be parcelled
out to the baptized, and other portions of the kingdom of God be given to the unbaptized,
as you seem to have determined, I beg of you to hear the Lord’s own words; He does not
say, “Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
or heaven;” but His words are, “he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” His discourse
with Nicodemus on the subject before us runs thus: “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except
a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Observe, He does not here say,
the kingdom of heaven, but the kingdom of God. And then, on Nicodemus asking Him in
reply, “How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his
mother’s womb and be born?” the Lord, in explanation, repeats His former statement more
plainly and openly: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born again of water and
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” Observe again, He uses the same
phrase, the kingdom of God, notthe kingdom of heaven.2451 It is worthy of remark, that while
He varies two expressions in explaining them the second time (for after saying, “Except a
man be born again,” He interprets that by the fuller expression, “Except a man be born of
water and the Spirit;” and in like manner He explains, “he cannot see,” by the completer
phrase, “he cannot enter into”), He yet makes no variation here; He said “the kingdom of
God” the first time, and He afterwards repeated the same phrase exactly. It is not now necessary
to raise and discuss the question, whether the kingdom of God and the kingdom of
heaven must be understood as involving different senses, or whether only one thing is described
under two designations. It is enough to find that no one can enter into the kingdom
of God, except he be washed in the laver of regeneration. I suppose you perceive by this
time how wide of the truth it is to separate from the kingdom of God any mansions that are
<note type="footnote">2450 Matt. vi. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">2451 John iii. 3–6.</note>

<pb n="987"/>
placed in the house of God. And as to the idea which you have entertained that there will
be found dwelling among the various mansions, which the Lord has told us abound in His
Father’s house, some who have not been born again of water and the Spirit, I advise you, if
you will permit me, not to defer amending it, in order that you may hold the catholic faith.</p>

<p>Again, if you wish to be a catholic, I pray you, neither believe, nor say, nor teach that
“the sacrifice of Christians ought to be offered in behalf of those who have departed out of
the body without having been baptized.” Because you fail to show that the sacrifice of the
Jews, which you have quoted out of the books of the Maccabees,2452 was offered in behalf
of any who had departed this life without circumcision. In this novel opinion of yours, which
you have advanced against the authority and teaching of the whole Church, you have used
a very arrogant mode of expression. You say, “In behalf of these, I most certainly decide
that constant oblations and incessant sacrifices must be offered up on the part of the holy
priests.” Here you show, as a layman, no submission to God’s priests for instruction; nor
do you associate yourself with them (the least you could do) for inquiry; but you put yourself
before them by your proud assumption of judgment. Away, my son, with all this pretension;
men walk not so arrogantly in the Way, which the Humble Christ taught that He Himself
is.2453 No man enters through His narrow gate with so proud a disposition as this.</p>

<p>Once more, if you desire to be a catholic, do not believe, or say, or teach that “some of
those persons who have departed this life without Christ’s baptism, do not in the meantime
go into the kingdom of heaven, but into paradise; yet afterwards in the resurrection of the
dead they attain also to the blessedness of the kingdom of heaven.” Even the Pelagian heresy
was not daring enough to grant them this, although it holds that infants do not contract
original sin. You, however, as a catholic, confess that they are born in sin; and yet by some
unaccountable perverseness in the novel opinion you put forth, you assert that they are absolved
from that sin with which they were born, and admitted into the kingdom of heaven
without the baptism which saves. Nor do you seem to be aware how much below Pelagius
himself you are in your views on this point. For he, being alarmed by that sentence of the
Lord which does not permit unbaptized persons to enter into the kingdom of heaven, does
not venture to send infants thither, although he believes them to be free from all sin;
whereas you have so little regard for what is written, “Except a man be born again of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,”2454 that (to say nothing of the
error which induces you recklessly to sever paradise from the kingdom of God) you do not
hesitate to promise to certain persons, whom you, as a catholic, believe to be born under
guilt, both absolution from this guilt and the kingdom of heaven, even when they die without
baptism. As if you could possibly be a true catholic because you build up the doctrine of
original sin against Pelagius, if you show yourself a new heretic against the Lord, by pulling
down His statement respecting baptism. For our own part, beloved brother, we do not desire
thus to gain victories over heretics: vanquishing one error by another, and, what is still
worse, a less one by a greater. You say, “Should any one perhaps be reluctant to allow that
paradise was temporarily bestowed in the meantime on the souls of the dying thief and of
Dinocrates, while there still remains to them the reversion of the kingdom of heaven at the
resurrection, seeing that the principal passage stands in the way of the opinion, ‘Except a
man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven,’
he may still hold my ungrudging assent on this point; only let him do full honour to both
the effect and the aim2455 of the divine mercy and foreknowledge.” These are your own
words, and in them you express your agreement with the man who says that paradise is
conferred on certain unbaptized for a time, in such a sense that at the resurrection there is
in store for them the reward of the kingdom of heaven, in opposition to “that principal
passage” which has determined that none shall enter into that kingdom who has not been
born again of water and the Holy Ghost. Pelagius was afraid to oppose himself to this
<note type="footnote">2454 John iii. 5.</note>

<pb n="990"/>
“principal passage” of the Gospel, and he did not believe that any (whom he still did not
suppose to be sinners) would enter into the kingdom of heaven unbaptized. You, on the
contrary, acknowledge that infants have original sin, and yet you absolve them from it
without the laver of regeneration, and send them for a temporary residence in paradise, and
subsequently permit them to enter even into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Now these errors, and such as these, with whatever others you may perhaps be able to
discover in your books on a more attentive and leisurely perusal, I beg of you to correct, if
you possess a catholic mind; in other words, if you spoke in perfect sincerity when you said,
that you were not over-confident in yourself that what statements you had made were all
capable of proof; and that your constant aim was not to maintain even your own opinion,
if it were shown to be improbable; and that it gave you much pleasure, if your own judgment
were condemned, to adopt and pursue better and truer sentiments. Well now, my dear
brother, show that you said this in no fallacious sense; so that the catholic Church may rejoice
in your capacity and character, as possessing not only genius, but prudence withal, and
piety, and moderation, rather than that the madness of heresy should be kindled by your
contentious persistence in these errors. Now you have an opportunity of showing also how
sincerely you expressed your feelings in the passage which immediately follows the satisfactory
statement which I have just now mentioned of yours. “For,” you say, “as it is the mark
of every highest aim and laudable purpose to transfer one’s self readily to truer views; so it
shows a depraved and obstinate judgment to refuse to return promptly to the pathway of
reason.” Well, then, show yourself to be influenced by this high aim and laudable purpose,
and transfer your mind readily to truer views; and do not display a depraved and obstinate
judgment by refusing to return promptly to the pathway of reason. For if your words were
uttered in frank sincerity, if they were not mere sound of the lips, if you really felt them in
your heart, then you cannot but abhor all delay in accomplishing the great good of correcting
yourself. It was not, indeed, much for you to allow, that it showed a depraved and obstinate
judgment to refuse to return to the pathway of reason, unless you had added “promptly.”
By adding this, you showed us how execrable is his conduct who never accomplishes the
reform; inasmuch as even he who effects it but tardily appears to you to deserve so severe
a censure, as to be fairly described as displaying a depraved and obstinate mind. Listen,
therefore, to your own admonition, and turn to good account mainly and largely the fruitful
resources of your eloquence; that so you may promptly return to the pathway of reason,
more promptly, indeed, than when you declined therefrom, at an unstable period of your
age, when you were fortified with too little prudence and less learning.</p>

<p>What these particular errors are, I have, to the best of my ability, already explained. But
I will run over them again with a brief recapitulation. One is, “That God did not make the
soul out of nothing, but out of His own self.” A second is, that “just as God who gives is
Himself ever existent, so is He ever giving souls through infinite time.” The third is, that
“the soul lost some merit by the flesh, which it had had previous to the flesh.” The fourth
is, that “the soul by means of the flesh recovers its ancient condition, and is born again
through the very same flesh by which it had deserved to be polluted.” The fifth is, that “the
soul deserved to be sinful, previous to any sin.” The sixth is, that “infants which are forestalled
by death before they are baptized, may yet attain to forgiveness of their original sins.” The
seventh is, that “they whom the Lord has predestinated to be baptized may be taken away
from his predestination, or die before that has been accomplished in them which the Almighty
has predestined.” The eighth is, that “it is of infants who are fore-stalled by death, before
they are born again in Christ, that the Scripture says, ‘Speedily was he taken away, lest
wickedness should alter his understanding,’” with the remainder of the passage to the same
effect in the Book of Wisdom. The ninth is, that “there are outside the kingdom of God
some of those mansions which the Lord said were in His Father’s house.” The tenth is, that
“the sacrifice of Christians ought to be offered in behalf of those who have departed out of
the body without being baptized.” The eleventh is, that “some of those persons who have
departed this life without the baptism of Christ do not in the meanwhile go into the kingdom,
but into paradise; afterwards, however, in the resurrection of the dead, they attain even to
the blessedness of the kingdom of heaven.”</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Obstinacy Makes the Heretic.</head>
<p>Well, now, as for these eleven propositions, they are extremely and manifestly perverse
and opposed to the catholic faith; so that you should no longer hesitate to root them out
and cast them away from your mind, from your words, and from your pen, if you are desirous
that we should rejoice not only at your having come over to our catholic altars, but at your
being really and truly a catholic. For if these dogmas of yours are severally maintained with
pertinacity, they may possibly engender as many heresies as they number opinions.
Wherefore consider, I pray you, how dreadful it is that they should be all concentrated in
one person, when they would, if held severally by various persons, be every one of them
damnable in each holder. If, however, you would in your own person cease to fight contentiously
in their defence, nay, would turn your arms against them by faithful words and
writings, you would acquire more praise as the censurer of your own self than if you directed
any amount of right criticism against any other person; and your amendment of your own
errors would bring you more admiration than if you had never entertained them. May the
Lord be present to your heart and mind, and by His Spirit pour into your soul such readiness
in humility, such light of truth, such sweetness of love, and such peaceful piety, that you
may prefer being a conqueror of your own spirit in the truth, than of any one else who
gainsays it with his errors. But I do not by any means wish you to think, that by holding
these opinions you have departed from the catholic faith, although they are unquestionably
opposed to the catholic faith; if so be you are able, in the presence of that God whose eye
infallibly searches every man’s heart, to look back on your own words as being truly and
sincerely expressed, when you said that you were not over-confident in yourself as to the
opinions you had broached, that they were all capable of proof; and that your constant aim
was not to persist in your own sentiments, if they were shown to be improbable; inasmuch
as it was a real pleasure to you, when any judgment of yours was condemned, to adopt and
pursue better and truer thoughts. Now such a temper as this, even in relation to what may
have been said in an uncatholic form through ignorance, is itself catholic by the very purpose
and readiness of amendment which it premeditates. With this remark, however, I must now
end this volume, where the reader may rest a while, ready to renew his attention to what is

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—The Personal Character of This Book.</head>
<p>I Must now, in the sequel of my treatise, request you to hear what I desire to say to you
concerning myself—as I best can; or rather as He shall enable me in whose hand are both
ourselves and our words. For you blamed me on two several occasions, even going so far as
to mention my name. In the beginning of your book you spoke of yourself as being perfectly
conscious of your own want of skill, and as being destitute of the support of learning; and,
when you mentioned me, bestowed on me the complimentary phrases of “most learned”
and “most skilful.” But yet, all the while, on those subjects in which you seemed to yourself
to be perfectly acquainted with what I either confess my ignorance of, or presume with no
unbecoming liberty to have some knowledge of, you—young as you are, and a layman
too—did not hesitate to censure me, an old man and a bishop, and a person withal whom
in your own judgment you had pronounced most learned and most skilful. Well, for my
own part, I know nothing about my great learning and skill; nay, I am very certain that I
possess no such eminent qualities; moreover, I have no doubt that it is quite within the scope
of possibility, that it may fall to the lot of even an unskilful and unlearned man occasionally
to know what a learned and skilful person is ignorant of; and in this I plainly commend you,
that you have preferred to merely personal regard a love of truth,—for if you have not understood
the truth, yet at any rate you have thought it such. This you have done no doubt
with temerity, because you thought you knew what you were really ignorant of; and without
restraint, because, having no respect of persons, you chose to publish abroad whatever was
in your mind. You ought therefore to understand how much greater our care should be to
recall the Lord’s sheep from their errors; since it is evidently wrong for even the sheep to
conceal from the shepherds whatever faults they have discovered in them. O that you censured
me in such things as are indeed worthy of just blame! For I must not deny that both
in my conduct and in my writings there are many points which may be censured by a sound
judge without temerity. Now, if you would select any of these for your censure, I might be

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—The Points Which Victor Thought Blameworthy in Augustin.</head>
<p>And they are these: The first, that I did not venture to make a definite statement
touching the origin of those souls which have been given, or are being given, to human beings,
since the first man—because I confess my ignorance of the subject; the second, because I
said I was sure the soul was spirit, not body. Under this second point, however, you have
included two grounds of censure: one, because I refused to believe the soul to be corporeal;
the other, because I affirmed it to be spirit. For to you the soul appears both to be body and
not to be spirit. I must therefore request your attention to my own defence against your
censure, and ask you to embrace the opportunity which my self-defence affords you of
learning what points there are in yourself also which require your amendment. Recall, then,
the words of your book in which you first mentioned my name. “I know,” you say, “many
men of very great reputation who when consulted have kept silence, or admitted nothing
clearly, but have withdrawn from their discussions everything definite when they commence
their exposition. Of such character are the contents of sundry writings which I have read at
your house by a very learned man and renowned bishop, called Augustin. The truth is, I
suppose, they have with an overweening modesty and diffidence investigated the mysteries
of this subject, and have consumed within themselves the judgment of their own treatises,
and have professed themselves incapable of determining anything on this point. But, I assure
you, it appears to me excessively absurd and unreasonable that a man should be a stranger
to himself; or that a person who is supposed to have acquired the knowledge of all things,
should regard himself as unknown to his very self. For what difference is there between a
man and a brute beast, if he knows not how to discuss and determine his own quality and
nature? so that there may justly be applied to him the statement of Scripture: ‘Man, although
he was in honour, understood not; he is like the cattle, and is compared with them.’2456 For
when the good and gracious God created everything with reason and wisdom, and produced
man as a rational animal, capable of understanding, endowed with reason, and lively with
sensation,—because by His prudent arrangement He assigns their place to all creatures
which do not participate in the faculty of reason,—what more incongruous idea could be
suggested, than that God had withheld from him the simple knowledge of himself? The
wisdom of this world, indeed, is ever aiming with much effort to attain to the knowledge of
truth; its researches, no doubt, fall short of the aim, from its inability to know through what
agency it is permitted that truth should be ascertained; but yet there are some things on the
nature of the soul, near (I might even say, akin) to the truth which it has attempted to discern.
Under these circumstances, how unbecoming and even shameful a thing it is, that any man
of religious principle should either have no intelligent views on this very subject, or prohibit
himself from acquiring any!”</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—How Much Do We Know of the Nature of the Body?</head>
<p>Well, now, this extremely lucid and eloquent castigation which you have inflicted on
our ignorance lays you so strictly under the necessity of knowing every possible thing which
appertains to the nature of man, that, should you unhappily be ignorant of any particular,
you must (and remember it is not I, but you, that have made the necessity) be compared
with “the cattle.” For although you appear to aim your censure at us more especially, when
you quote the passage, “Man, although he was in honour, understood not,” inasmuch as we
(unlike yourself) hold an honourable place in the Church; yet even you occupy too honourable
a rank in nature, not to be preferred above the cattle, with which according to your
own judgment you will have to be compared, if you should happen to be ignorant on any
of the points which manifestly appertain to your nature. For you have not merely aspersed
with your censure those who are affected with the same ignorance as I am myself labouring
under, that is to say, concerning the origin of the human soul (although I am not indeed
absolutely ignorant even on this point, for I know that God breathed into the face of the
first man, and that “man then became a living soul,”2457—a truth, however, which I could
never have known by myself, unless I had read of it in the Scripture); but you asked in so
many words, “What difference is there between a man and a brute beast, if he knows not
how to discuss and determine his own quality and nature?” And you seem to have entertained
your opinion so distinctly, as to have thought that a man ought to be able to discuss and
determine the facts of his own entire quality and nature so clearly, that nothing concerning
himself should escape his observation. Now, if this is really the truth of the matter, I must
now compare you to “the cattle,” if you cannot tell me the precise number of the hairs of
your head. But if, however far we may advance in this life, you allow us to be ignorant of
sundry facts appertaining to our nature, I then want to know how far your concession extends,
lest, perchance, it may include the very point we are now raising, that we do not by
any means know the origin of our soul; although we know,—a thing which belongs to
faith,—beyond all doubt, that the soul is a gift to man from God, and that it still is not of
the same nature as God Himself. Do you, moreover, think that each person’s ignorance of
his own nature must be exactly on the same level as your ignorance of it? Must everybody’s
knowledge, too, of the subject be equal to what you have been able to attain to? So that if he
is so unfortunate as to possess a slightly larger amount of ignorance than yourself, you must
compare him with cattle; and on the same principle, if any one shall be ever so little wiser
than yourself on this subject, he will have the pleasure of comparing you with equal justice
to the aforesaid cattle. I must therefore request you to tell me, to what extent you permit us
to be ignorant of our nature so as to save our distance from the formidable cattle; and I beg
you besides duly to reflect, whether he is not further removed from cattle who knows his
<note type="footnote">2457 Gen. ii. 7.</note>

<pb n="999"/>
ignorance of any part of the subject, than he is who thinks he knows what in fact he knows
not. The entire nature of man is certainly spirit, soul, and body; therefore, whoever would
alienate the body from man’s nature, is unwise. Those medical men, however, who are called
anatomists have investigated with careful scrutiny, by dissecting processes, even living men,
so far as men have been able to retain any life in the hands of the examiners; their researches
have penetrated limbs, veins, nerves, bones, marrow, the internal vitals; and all to discover
the nature of the body. But none of these men have ever thought of comparing us with the
cattle, because of our ignorance of their subject. But perhaps you will say that it is those who
are ignorant of the nature of the soul, not of the body, who are to be compared with the
brute beasts. Then you ought not to have expressed yourself at starting in the way you have
done. Your words are not, “For what difference is there between a man and cattle, if he is
ignorant of the nature and quality of the soul;” but you say, “if he knows not how to discuss
and determine his own nature and quality.” Of course our quality and our nature must be
taken account of together with the body, but at the same time the investigation of the several
elements of which we are composed is conducted in each case separately. For my own part,
indeed, if I wished to display how far it was in my power to treat scientifically and intelligently
the entire field of man’s nature, I should have to fill many volumes; not to mention how
many topics there are which I must confess my ignorance of.</p>

<head>Chapter 4 <del>III.</del>—Is the Question of Breath One that Concerns the Soul, or Body, or
What?</head>
<p>But to what, in your judgment, does that which we discussed in our former book concerning
the breath of man belong?—to the nature of the soul, seeing that it is the soul which
effects it in man; or to that of the body, since the body is moved by the soul to effect it; or
to that of this air, by whose alternation of action it is discovered to effect it; or rather to all
three, that is to say, to the soul as that which moves the body, and to the body which by its
motion receives and emits the breath, and also to the circumambient air which raises by its
entrance, and by its departure depresses? And yet you were evidently ignorant of all this,
learned and eloquent though you are, when you supposed, and said, and wrote, and read
in the presence of the crowd assembled to hear your opinion, that it was out of our own
nature that we inflated a bag, and yet had no diminution of our nature at all by the operation;
although you might most easily ascertain how we accomplish the process, not by any tedious
examination of the pages either of human or of inspired writings, but by a simple investigation
of your own physical action, whenever you liked. This, then, being the case, how can I
trust you to teach me concerning the origin of souls,—a subject which I confess myself to
be ignorant of,—you who are actually ignorant of what you are doing unintermittingly with
your nose and mouth, and of why you are doing it? May the Lord bring it to pass that you
may be advised by me, and accept rather than resist so manifest a truth, and one so ready
to your hand. May you also not interrogate your lungs about the bag inflation in such a
temper as to prefer inflating them in opposition to me, rather than acquiesce in their tuition,
when they answer your inquiry with entire truth,—not by speech and altercation, but by
breath and respiration. Then I could bear with you patiently while you correct and reproach
me for my ignorance of the origin of souls; nay, I could even warmly thank you, if, besides
inflicting on me rebuke, you would convince me with truth. For if you could teach me the
truth I am ignorant of, it would be my duty to bear with all patience any blows you might

<head>Chapter 5 <del>IV.</del>—God Alone Can Teach Whence Souls Come.</head>
<p>Now with respect to the question between us, I confess to your loving self2458 I greatly
desire to know one of two things if I can,—either concerning the origin of souls, of which
I am ignorant, or whether this knowledge is within our reach so long as we are in the present
life. For what if our controversy touches the very points of which it is enjoined to us, “Seek
not out the things that are too high for thee, neither search the things that are above thy
strength; but whatever things the Lord hath commanded and taught thee, think thereupon
for evermore.”2459 This, then, is what I desire to know, either from God Himself, who knows
what He creates, or even from some competently learned man who knows what he is saying,
not from a person who is ignorant of the breath he heaves. It is not everybody who recollects
his own infancy; and do you suppose that a man is able, without divine instruction, to know
whence he began to exist in his mother’s womb,—especially if the knowledge of human
nature has so completely eluded him as to leave him ignorant, not only of what is within
him, but of that also which is added to his nature from without? Will you, my dearest
brother, be able to teach me, or any one else, whence human beings at their birth are ensouled,
2460 when you still know not how it is that their life is so sustained by food, that they
are certain to die if the aliment is withdrawn for a while? Or will you be able to teach me,
or any one else, whence men obtain their souls, when you are still actually ignorant whence
bags, when inflated, get the filling? My only wish, as you are ignorant whence souls have
their origin, is, that I may on my side know whether such knowledge is attainable by me in
this present life. If this be one of the things which are too high for us, and which we are
forbidden to seek out or search into, then we have good grounds for fearing lest we should
sin, not by our ignorance of it, but our quest after it. For we ought not to suppose that a
subject, to fall under the category of the things which are too high for us, must appertain to
the nature of God, and not to our own.</p>

<head>Chapter 6 <del>V.</del>—Questions About the Nature of the Body are Sufficiently Mysterious,
and Yet Not Higher Than Those of the Soul.</head>
<p>What do you say to the statement, that amongst the works of God there are some which
it is more difficult to know than even God Himself,—so far, indeed, as He can be an object
of knowledge to us at all? For we have learnt that God is a Trinity; but to this very day we
do not know how many kinds of animals, not even of land animals which were able to enter
Noah’s ark,2461 He has created—unless by some happy chance you have ascertained this
fact. Again, in the Book of Wisdom it is written, “For if they were able to prevail so much,
that they could know and estimate the world; how is it that they did not more easily find
out the Lord thereof?”2462 Is it because the subject before us is within us that it is therefore
not too high for us? For it must be granted that the nature of our soul is a more internal
thing than our body. As if the soul has been no better able to explore the body itself externally
by the eyes of that body than internally by its own means. For what is there in the inward
parts of the body where the soul does not exist? But yet, even with regard to these several
inner and vital portions of our frame, the soul has examined and searched them out by the
bodily eyes; and all that it has succeeded in learning of them it has acquired by means of the
eyes of the body; and, without doubt, all the material substance was there, even when the
soul knew not of it. Since also our inward parts are incapable of living without the soul, it
follows that the soul has been more able to give them life than to know them. Well, then, is
the soul’s body a higher object for its knowledge than the soul’s own self? And therefore if
it wishes to inquire and consider when human seed is converted into blood, when into solid
flesh; when the bones begin to harden, and when to fill with marrow; how many kinds of
veins and nerves there are; by what channels and circuits the former serve for irrigation and
the latter for ligature to the entire body; whether the skin is to be reckoned among the nerves,
and the teeth among the bones,—for they show some difference, inasmuch as they have no
marrow; and in what respect the nails differ from both, being similar to them in hardness,
while they possess a quality in common with the hair, in being capable of growing and being
cut; what, again, is the use of those veins wherein air, instead of blood, circulates, which
they call the arteries2463—if, I repeat, the soul desired to come to know these and similar
points respecting the nature of its body, ought it then to be said to a man, “Seek not out the
things that are too high for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength?” But,
<note type="footnote">2461 Gen. vii. 8, 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2462 Wisd. xiii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2463 These vessels which carry the blood from the heart were formerly supposed, from being found empty
after death, to contain only air; and hence, indeed, their name,—for “the artery” was originally the windpipe.
Comp. Cicero (De Nat. Deor. ii. 55, 138): “Sanguis per venas in omne corpus diffunditur, et spiritus per arterias”:
i.e. Blood is diffused throughout the body by the veins, and air by the arteries.</note>

<pb n="1003"/>
if the inquiry be made into the soul’s own origin, of which subject it knows nothing, the
matter then, forsooth, is not too high or beyond one’s strength to be capable of apprehension?
And you deem it an absurd thing, and incompatible with reason, for the soul not to know
whether it is inbreathed by God, or whether it is derived from the parents, although it does
not remember this event as soon as it is past, and reckons it among the things which it has
forgotten beyond recall,—like infancy, and all other stages of life which followed close upon
birth, though doubtless, when they happened, they were not unaccompanied with sensation.
But yet you do not deem it absurd or unreasonable that it should be ignorant of the body
which is subject to it, and should know nothing whatever about incidents pertaining to it
which are not in the category of things that are past, but of present facts, —as to whether it
sets the veins in motion in order to produce life in the body, but the nerves in order to operate
by the limbs of the body; and if so, why it does not move the nerves except at its especial
will, whereas it affects the pulsations of the veins without intermission, even without willing;
from what part of the body that which they call the ἡγεμονικόν (the authoritative part of
the soul, the reason) exercises its universal rule, whether from the heart or from the brain,
or by a distribution, the motions from the heart and the sensations from the brain,—or from
the brain, both the sensations and voluntary motions, but from the heart, the involuntary
pulsations of the veins; and once more, if it does both of these from the brain, how is it that
it has the sensations, even without willing, while it does not move the limbs except it wills?
Inasmuch, then, as only the soul itself does all this in the body, how is it that it knows not
what it does? or whence its power to do it? And it is no disgrace to it to be so ignorant. Then
do you suppose it to be a discredit if it knows not whence or how it was itself made, since
it certainly did not make itself? Well, then, none know how or whence the soul effects all
its action in the body; do you not therefore think that it, too, appertains to those things
which are said to be “too high for us, and above our strength”?</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>VI.</del>—We Often Need More Teaching as to What is Most Intimately
Ours Than as to What is Further from Us.</head>
<p>But I have to put to you a far wider question arising out of our subject. Why should
only a very few know why all men do what they do? Perhaps you will tell me, Because they
have learnt the art of anatomy or experiment, which are both comprised in the physician’s
education, which few obtain, while others have refused to acquire the information, although
they might, of course, if they had liked. Here, then, I say nothing of the point why many try
to acquire this information, but cannot, because they are hindered by a slow intellect (which,
however, is a very strange fact) from learning of others what is done by their own selves and
in their own selves. But this is a very important question which I now ask, Why I should
have no need of art to know that there is a sun in the heavens, and a moon, and other stars;
but must have the aid of art to know, on moving my finger, whence the act begins,—from
the heart, or the brain, or from both, or from neither: why I do not require a teacher to know
what is so much higher than me; but must yet wait for some one else to learn whence that
is done by me which is done within me? For although we are said to think in our heart, and
although we know what our thoughts are, without the knowledge of any other person, yet
we know not in what part of the body we have the heart itself, where we do our thinking,
unless we are taught it by some other person, who yet is ignorant of what we think. I am
not unaware that when we hear that we should love God with our whole heart, this is not
said of that portion of our flesh which lies under our ribs, but of that power that originates
our thoughts. And this is properly designated by this name, because, as motion does not
cease in the heart whence the pulsation of the veins radiates in every direction, so in the
process of thought we do not rest in the act itself and abstain from further pondering. But
although every sensation is imparted even to the body by the soul, how is it that we can
count our external limbs, even in the dark and with closed eyes, by the bodily sense which
is called “touch,” but we know nothing of our internal functions in the very central region
of the soul itself, where that power is present which imparts life and animation to all else,—a
mystery this which, I apprehend, no medical men of any kind, whether empirics, or anatomists,
or dogmatists, or methodists,2464 or any man living, have any knowledge of?</p>

<p>And whosoever shall have attempted to fathom such knowledge may not improperly
have addressed to him the words we have before quoted, “Seek not out the things that are
too high for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength.” Now it is not a
question of mere altitude, such as is beyond our stature, but it is an elevation which our intelligence
cannot reach, and a strength which our mental power cannot cope with. And yet
it is neither the heaven of heavens, nor the measure of the stars, nor the scope of sea and
land, nor the nethermost hell; it is our own selves that we are incapable of comprehending;
it is our own selves, who, in our too great height and strength, transcend the humble limits
of our own knowledge; it is our own selves, whom we are incapable of embracing, although
we are certainly not beside ourselves. But we are not to be compared with cattle simply because
we do not perfectly discover what we ourselves are: and yet you think that we deserve
the humiliating comparison, if we have forgotten what we were, even though we knew it
once. My soul is not now being derived from my parents, is not now receiving insufflation
from God. Whichever of these two processes He used, He used when He created me; He is
not at this moment using it of me, or within me. It is past and gone,—not a present thing,
nor a recent one to me. I do not even know whether I was aware of it and then forgot it; or
whether I was unable, even at the time when it was done, to feel and to know it.</p>

that we possess memory, understanding, and will; who boast of ourselves as having a great
knowledge of our own nature;—observe, I say, how entirely ignorant we are of what avail
to us is our memory, or our understanding, or our will. A certain man who from his youth
has been a friend of mine, named Simplicius, is a person of accurate and astonishing memory.
I once asked him to tell me what were the last lines but one of all the books of Virgil; he
immediately answered my question without the least hesitation, and with perfect accuracy.
I then asked him to repeat the preceding lines; he did so. And I really believe that he could
have repeated Virgil line after line backward. For wherever I wished, I made trial whether
he could do it, and he did it. Similarly in prose, from any of Cicero’s orations, which he had
learnt by heart, he would perform a similar feat at our request, by reciting backwards as far
as we wished. Upon our expressing astonishment, he called God to witness that he had no
idea of this ability of his previous to that trial. So far, therefore, as memory is concerned,
his mind only then learnt its own power; and such discovery would at no time be possible
except by trial and experiment. Moreover, he was of course the very same man before he
tried his powers; how was it, then, that he was ignorant of himself?</p>

<p>We often assume that we shall retain a thing in our memory; and so thinking, we do
not write it down. But afterwards, when we wish to recall it, it refuses to come to mind; and
we are then sorry that we thought it would return to memory, or that we did not secure it
in writing so as to prevent its escape; and lo, on a sudden, without our seeking it, it occurs
to us. Then does it follow that we were not ourselves when we thought this? And that we
cease to be the same thing that we were, when we are no longer able to think it? Now how
does it happen that I know not how we are abstracted from, and denied to, ourselves; and
similarly am ignorant how we are restored and returned to ourselves? As if we are other
persons, and elsewhere, when we seek, but fail to find, what we deposited in our memory;
and are ourselves incapable of returning to ourselves, as if we were situated somewhere else;
but afterwards return again, on finding ourselves out. For where do we make our quest,
except in our own selves? And what is it we search for, except our own selves? As if we were
not actually at home in our persons, but had gone somewhither. Do you not observe, even
with alarm, so deep a mystery? And what is all this but our own nature—not what it has
been, but such as it now is? And observe how much more we seek than we comprehend. I
have often believed that I could understand a question which had been submitted to me, if
I were to bestow thought upon it. Well, I have bestowed the thought, but have not been able
to solve the question; and many a time I have not so believed, and yet have been able to determine

<p>But perhaps you despise me for confessing all this, and will in consequence compare
me with “cattle.” For myself, however, I will not cease to advise you, or (if you refuse to
listen to me) at all events to warn you, to acknowledge rather this common infirmity, in
which virtue is perfected; lest, by assuming unknown things to be known, you fail to attain

are unable; which you would never seek to understand, unless you hoped some day to succeed
in your research. Thus you also are ignorant of the powers of your own understanding, who
profess to know all about your own nature, and decline to follow me in my confession of
ignorance. Well, there is also the will; what am I to say about that, where certainly free choice
is ostentatiously claimed by us? The blessed Apostle Peter, indeed, was willing to lay down
his life for the Lord. He was no doubt sincere in his willingness; nor was he treacherous to
the Lord when he made the promise. But his will was entirely ignorant of its own powers.
Therefore the great apostle, who had discovered his Master to be the Son of God, was unknown
to himself. Thus we are quite aware respecting ourselves that we will a thing, or “nill”

<head>Chapter 12 [VIII.]—The Apostle Paul Could Know the Third Heaven and Paradise,
But Not Whether He Was in the Body or Not.</head>
<p>See therefore how many facts of our nature, not of the past but of the present time, and
not pertaining to the body only, but also to our inner man, we know nothing about, without
deserving to be compared with the brute beasts. And yet this is the opprobrious comparison
which you have thought me worthy of, because I have not complete knowledge of the past
origin of my soul—although I am not wholly ignorant of it, inasmuch as I know that it was
given me by God, and yet that it is not out of God. But when can I enumerate all the particulars
relating to the nature of our spirit and our soul of which we are ignorant? Whereas
we ought rather to utter that exclamation before God, which the Psalmist uttered: “The
knowledge of Thee is too wonderful for me; it is very difficult, I cannot attain to it.”2465
Now why did he add the words for me, except because he conjectured how incomprehensible
was the knowledge of God for himself, inasmuch as he was unable to comprehend even his
own self? The apostle was caught up into the third heaven, and heard unspeakable words,
which it is not lawful for a man to utter; and whether this had happened to him in the body
or out of the body, he declares himself unable to say;2466 but yet he has no fear of encountering
from you comparison with the cattle. His spirit knew that it was in the third heaven,
in paradise; but knew not whether it was in the body. The third heaven, of course, and
paradise were not the Apostle Paul himself; but his body and soul and spirit were himself.
Behold, then, the curious fact: he knew the great things—lofty and divine—which were not
himself; but that which appertained to his own nature he was ignorant of. Who in the vast
knowledge of such occult things can help being astonished at his great ignorance of his own
existence? Who, in short, would believe it possible, if one who errs not had not told us, that
“we know not what we should pray for as we ought”?2467 Where, then, ought our bent and
purpose mainly to be—to “reach forth to those things which are before”? And yet you
compare me to cattle, if among the things which are behind I have forgotten anything concerning
my own origin—although you hear the same apostle say: “Forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the
mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”2468</p>

<head>Chapter 13 <del>IX.</del>—In What Sense the Holy Ghost is Said to Make Intercession for
Us.</head>
<p>Do you perhaps also think me ridiculous and like the irrational beasts, because I said,
“We know not what we should pray for as we ought”? Perhaps this is not quite so intolerable.
For since, in the dictates of a sound and righteous judgment, we prefer our future to our
past; and since our prayer must have reference not to what we have been, but what we shall
be, it is of course much more injurious not to know what we should pray for, than to be ignorant
of the manner of our origin. But recollect whose words I repeated, or read them
again for yourself, and reflect whence they come; and do not pelt me with your reproaches,
lest the stone you throw should alight on a head you would not wish. For it is the great
teacher of the Gentiles, the Apostle Paul himself, who said, “For we know not what we should
pray for as we ought.”2469 And he not only taught this lesson by word, but also illustrated
it by his example. For, contrary to his own advantage and the promotion of his own salvation,
he once in his ignorance prayed that “the thorn in the flesh might depart from him,” which
he said had been given to him “lest he should be exalted above measure by the abundance
of the revelations which were given him.”2470 But the Lord loved him, and so did not do
what he had requested Him to do. Nevertheless, when the apostle said, “We know not what
we should pray for as we ought,” he immediately added, “But the Spirit Himself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And He that searcheth the hearts
knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because He maketh intercession for the saints according
to the will of God”2471—that is to say, He makes the saints offer intercessions. He,
of course, is that Spirit “whom God hath sent into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father;”2472
and “by whom we cry, Abba, Father;”2473 for both expressions are used by the apostle—both
that we have received the Spirit who cries, Abba, Father; and also that it is through Him that
we cry, Abba, Father. His object is to explain by these varied statements in what sense he
used the word “crying:” he meant causing to cry; so that it is we who cry at His instance and
impulse. Let Him therefore teach me this too, whenever He pleases, if He knows it to be
expedient for me, that I should know whence I derive my origin as regards my soul. But let
me be taught by that Spirit who searches the deep things of God; not by a man who knows
nothing of the breath which inflates a bag. However, be it far from me to compare you with
brutes because of this piece of ignorance; because it arose not from incurable inability, but
from sheer inadvertence.</p>

<head>Chapter 14 <del>X.</del>—It is More Excellent to Know That the Flesh Will Rise Again and
Live for Evermore, Than to Learn Whatever Scientific Men Have Been Able to
Teach Us Concerning Its Nature.</head>
<p>But although the questions which arise touching the origin of souls are “higher,” no
doubt, than that which treats of the source whence the breath comes which we inhale and
exhale, you yet believe that those things are “higher” which you have learnt out of the Holy
Scriptures, from which we derive what we learn by faith; and such as are not traceable by
any human minds. Of course it is far more excellent to know that the flesh will rise again
and will live for evermore, than any thing that scientific men have been able to discover in
it by careful examination, which the soul perceives by no outward sense, although its presence
quickens all the things of which it is ignorant. It is also far better to know that the soul,
which has been born again and renewed in Christ, will be blessed for ever, than to discover
all that we are ignorant of touching its memory, understanding, and will. Now these subjects,
which I have designated as more excellent and as better, we could by no means find out,
unless we believed them on the testimony of the inspired Scriptures. These Scriptures you
perhaps think you so thoroughly believe, that you do not hesitate to draw out of them a
definite theory about the origin of souls. Well, then, first of all, if it be as you suppose, you
ought never to have attributed to human nature itself what man knows by discussion and
inquiry about his own nature and quality, but to God’s gift. Now you asked: “Wherein does
a man differ from the cattle, if he is ignorant of this?” But why need we read any thing, in
order to know this, if we ought already to know it by the very fact that we are different from
cattle? For just as you do not read anything to me for the purpose of teaching me that I am
alive (my own nature making it impossible that I should be ignorant of this fact), so if it is
an attribute of nature to know this other matter, why do you produce passages of Scripture
for me to believe concerning this subject? Is it then only those persons who read them that
differ from the cattle? Are we not so created as to be different from brute animals, even before
we can acquire the art of reading? Pray, tell me how it is that you put in so high a claim for
our nature, that by the very circumstance of its differing from cattle it already knows how
to discuss and inquire into the origin of souls; while at the same time you make it so inexpert
in this knowledge, as to be unable by human endowment to know this without it believe
the divine testimonies.</p>

<head>Chapter 15 <del>XI.</del>—We Must Not Be Wise Above What is Written.</head>
<p>But then, again, you are mistaken in this matter; for the passages of Scripture which
you chose to produce for the solution of this question of yours, do not prove the point. For
it is another thing which they prove, without which we cannot really lead a pious life, namely,
that we have in God the giver, creator, and fashioner of our souls. But how He does this for
them, whether by inbreathing them as new, or by deriving them from the parents, they do
not tell us—except in the instance of that one soul which He gave to the first man. Read attentively
what I have written to that servant of God, our brother Renatus;2474 for inasmuch
as I have pointed it all out to him there, it is not necessary for me to repeat my proofs here.
But you would like me to follow your example in definiteness of theory, and so thrust myself
into such difficulties as you have surrounded yourself with. Involved in these, you have
spoken many stout words against the catholic faith; if, however, you would faithfully and
humbly bethink yourself and consider, you would assuredly see how greatly it would have
profited you, if you had only known how to be natural and consistent in your ignorance;
and how this advantage is still open to you, if you were even now able to maintain such
propriety. Now, since understanding so pleases you in man’s nature (for, truly enough, if
our nature were without it, we should not be different from brute beasts, so far as our souls
are concerned), understand, I beg of you, what it is that you do not understand, lest you
should understand nothing: and do not despise any man who, in order that he may truly
understand, understands that he does not understand that which he does not understand.2475
With regard, however, to the passage in the inspired psalm, “Man, being in honour, understandeth
not; he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like unto them;”2476 read and
understand these words, that you may rather with a humble spirit guard against the opprobrium
yourself, than arrogantly throw it out against another person. The passage applies to
those who regard only that as a life worth living which they live in the flesh—having no
hope after death—just like “cattle;” it has no reference to those who never deny their
knowledge of what they actually know, and always acknowledge their ignorance of what
they really do not know; who, in point of fact, are aware of their weakness, rather than
confident of their strength.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Ignorance is Better Than Error. Predestination to Eternal Life, and
Predestination to Eternal Death.</head>
<p>Do not, my son, let senile timidity displease your youthful confidence. For my own part,
indeed, if I proved unequal, either under the teaching of God or of some spiritual instructor,
to the task of understanding the subject of our present inquiry on the origin of souls, I am
more prepared to vindicate God’s righteous will, that we should remain in ignorance on
this point, as on many others, than to say in my rashness what either is so obscure that I
can neither bring it home to the intelligence of other people, nor understand it myself; or
certainly even to help the cause of the heretics who endeavour to persuade us that the souls
of infants are entirely free from guilt, on the ground, forsooth, that such guilt would only
recoil on God as its Author, for having compelled innocent souls (for the help of which He
knew beforehand no laver of regeneration was prepared) to become sinful, by assigning
them to sinful flesh without any provision for that grace of baptism which should prevent
their incurring eternal damnation. For the fact undoubtedly is, that numberless souls of
infants pass out of the body before they are baptized. God forbid that I should cast about
for any futile effort to dilute this stern fact, and say what you have yourself said: “That the
soul deserved to be polluted by the flesh, and to become sinful, though it previously had no
sin, by reason of which it could be rightly said to have incurred this desert.” And again:
“That even without baptism original sins may be remitted.” And once more: “That even the
kingdom of heaven is at last bestowed on those who have not been baptized.” Now, if I were
not afraid to utter these and similar poisonous allegations against the faith, I should probably
not be afraid to propound some definite theory on this subject. How much better, then, is
it, that I should not separately dispute and affirm about the soul, what I am ignorant of; but
simply hold what I see the apostle has most plainly taught us: That owing to one man all
pass into condemnation who are born of Adam2477 unless they are born again in Christ,
even as He has appointed them to be regenerated, before they die in the body, whom He
predestinated to everlasting life, as the most merciful bestower of grace; whilst to those
whom He has predestinated to eternal death, He is also the most righteous awarder of
punishment not only on account of the sins which they add in the indulgence of their own
will, but also because of their original sin, even if, as in the case of infants, they add nothing
thereto. Now this is my definite view on that question, so that the hidden things of God may
keep their secret, without impairing my own faith.</p>

<head>Chapter 17 <del>XII.</del>—A Twofold Question to Be Treated Concerning the Soul; Is It
“Body”? and is It “Spirit”? What Body is.</head>
<p>And now, as far as the Lord vouchsafes to enable me, I must reply also to that allegation
of yours, in which, speaking of the soul, you again mention my name, and say, “We do not,
as the very able and learned bishop Augustin professes, allow it to be incorporeal and also
a spirit.” We have therefore, first, to discuss the question, whether the soul is to be deemed
incorporeal, as I have said; or corporeal, as you hold. Then, secondly, whether in our
Scriptures it is called a spirit—although not the whole but its own separate part is also
properly called spirit.2478 Well, I should, to begin with, like to know how you define body.
For if that is not “body” which does not consist of limbs of flesh, then the earth cannot be
a body, nor the sky, nor a stone, nor water, nor the stars, nor anything of the kind. If, however,
a “body” is whatever consists of parts, whether greater or less, which occupy greater or
smaller local spaces, then all the things which I have just mentioned are bodies; the air is a
body; the visible light is a body; and so are all the things which the apostle has in view, when
he says, “There are celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial.”2479</p>
<note type="footnote">2478 [The author seems here to have such texts as 1 Thess. v. 23 in mind (see below, chs. 19 and 36), and to
mean that sometimes the whole inner man is called “spirit,” and sometimes “spirit” is distinguished from
“soul.”—W.]</note>

<head>Chapter 18.—The First Question, Whether the Soul is Corporeal; Breath and Wind,
Nothing Else Than Air in Motion.</head>
<p>Now whether the soul is such a substance, is an extremely nice and subtle question.
You, indeed, with a promptitude for which I very greatly congratulate you, affirm that God
is not a body. But then, again, you give me some anxiety when you say, “If the soul lacks
body, so as to be (as some persons are pleased to suppose) of hollow emptiness, of airy and
futile substance.” Now, from these words you seem to believe, that everything which lacks
body is of an empty substance. Well, if this is the case, how do you dare to say that God
lacks body, without fearing the consequence that He is of an empty substance? If, however,
God has not a body, as you have just allowed; and if it be profane to say that He is of an
empty substance; then not everything which lacks body is an empty substance. And therefore
a person who contends that the soul is incorporeal does not necessarily mean, that it is of
an empty and futile substance; for he allows that God, who is not an empty being, is at the
same time incorporeal. But observe what great difference there is between my actual assertion,
and what you suppose me to say. I do not say that the soul is an airy substance; if I did, I
should admit that it is a body. For air is a body; as all who understand what they say declare,
whenever they speak concerning bodily substances. But you, because I called the soul incorporeal,
supposed me not only to predicate mere emptiness of it, but, as the result of such
predication, to say that it is “an airy substance;” whereas I must have said both that it has
not corporeity, which air has, and that what is filled with air could not be empty. And your
own bag similes failed to remind you of this. For when the bags are inflated, what is it but
air that is pressed into them? And they are so far from being empty, that by reason of their
distension they become even ponderous. But perhaps the breath seems to you to be a different
thing from air; although your very breath is nothing else than air in motion; and what this
is, can be seen from the shaking of a fan. With respect to any hollow vessels, which you may
suppose to be empty, you may ascertain with certainty that they are really full, by lowering
them straight into the water, with the mouth downwards. You see no water can get in, by
reason of the air with which they are filled. If, however, they are lowered either in the opposite
way, with mouth upward, or aslant, they then fill, as the water enters at the same opening
where the air passes out and escapes. This could be, of course, more easily proved by performing
the experiment, than by a description in writing. This, however, is not the time or
place for longer delay on the subject; for whatever may be your perception of the nature of
the air, as to whether it has corporeity or not, you certainly ought not to suppose me to have
said that the soul is an aerial thing, but absolutely incorporeal. And this even you acknowledge
God to be, whom you do not dare to describe as an empty substance, while you cannot but
admit that He has an essence which is unchangeable and almighty. Now, why should we
fear that the soul is an empty void, if it be incorporeal, when we confess that God is incorporeal,
and at the same time deny Him to be an empty void? Thus it was within the compet-

<pb n="1016"/>
ency of an Incorporeal Being to create an incorporeal soul, even as the living God made
living man; although, as the unchangeable and the almighty, He communicated not these
attributes to the changeable and far inferior creature.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">

<head>Chapter 19 <del>XIII.</del>—Whether the Soul is a Spirit.</head>
<p>But again, why you would have the soul to be a body, and refuse to deem it a spirit, I
cannot see. For if it is not a spirit, on the ground that the apostle named it with distinction
from the spirit, when he said, “I pray God your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved,”
2480 the same is a good reason why it is not a body, inasmuch as he named the body,
too, as distinct from it. If you affirm that the soul is a body, although they are both distinctly
named; you should allow it to be a spirit, although these are also distinctly named. Indeed,
the soul has a much greater claim to be regarded by you as a spirit than a body; because you
acknowledge the spirit and the soul to be of one substance, but deny the soul and the body
to be of one substance. On what principle, then, is the soul a body, when its nature is different
from that of a body; and not a spirit, although its nature and a spirit’s is one and the same?
Why, according to your argument, must you not confess that even the spirit is a body? For
otherwise, if the spirit is not a body, and the soul is a body, the soul and the spirit are not
of one and the same substance. You, however, allow them both (although believing them
to be two separate things) to have one substance. Therefore, if the soul is a body, the spirit
is a body also; for under no other condition can they be regarded as being of one and the
same nature. On your own principles, therefore, the statement of the apostle, who mentions,
“Your spirit, and soul, and body,” must imply three bodies; yet the body, which has likewise
the name of flesh, is of a different nature. And of these three bodies, as you would call them,
of which one is of a different, and the other two of one and the same substance, the entire
human being is composed—one thing and one existence. Now, although you assert this, yet
you will not allow that the two which are of one and the same substance, that is, the soul
and the spirit, should have the one designation of spirit; whilst the two things which are not
of one and the same substance ought, as you suppose, to have the one name of body.</p>

<head>Chapter 20 <del>XIV.</del>—The Body Does Not Receive God’s Image.</head>
<p>But I pass by all this, lest the discussion between us should degenerate into one of names
rather than things. Let us, then, see whether the inner man be the soul, or the spirit, or both.
I observe, however, that you have expressed your opinion on the point in writing, calling
the inner man the soul; for of this you spoke when you said: “And as the substance congealed,
which was incapable of comprehension, it would produce another body within the body
rounded and amassed by the force and twirl of its own nature, and thus an inner man would
begin to appear, who, being moulded in a corporeal sheath would in its lineaments be shaped
after the likeness of its outer man.” And from this you draw the following inference: “God’s
breath, therefore, made the soul; yea, that breath from God was made the soul, an image,
substantial, corporeal according to its own nature, like its own body, and conformed to its
image.” After this you proceed to speak of the spirit, and say: “This soul which had its origin
from the breath of God could not exist without an innermost sense and intellect of its own;
and such is the spirit.” As I, then, understand your statement, you mean the inner man to
be the soul, and the inmost one to be the spirit; as if the latter were inferior to the soul, as
this is to the body. Whence it comes to pass, that just as the body receives another body
pervading its own inner cavity, which (as you suppose) is the soul; so in its turn must the
soul be regarded as having its interior emptiness also, where it could receive the third body,
even the spirit; and thus the whole man consists of three, the outer, the inner, and the inmost.
Now, do you not yet perceive what great absurdities follow in your wake, when you attempt
the asseveration that the soul is corporeal? Tell me, I pray you, which of the two is it that is
to be renewed in the knowledge of God, after the image of Him that created him? 2481 The
inner, or the inmost? For my own part, indeed, I do not see that the apostle, besides the inner
and the outer man, knows anything of another man inside the inner one, that is, of an inmost
man. But you must decide which it is you would have to be renewed after the image of God.
How is he to receive this, who has already got the image of the outer man? For if the inner
man has run throughout the limbs of the outward one, and congealed (for this is the term
you have used; as if a molten shape were formed out of soft clay, which was thickened out
of the dust), how, if this same figure which has been impressed upon it, or rather expressed
out of a body, is to retain its place, could it be refashioned after the image of God? Is it to
have two images—God’s from above, that of the body from below—as is said in the case of
money, “Heads and Tails”?2482 Will you perhaps say, that the soul received the bodily image,
and that the spirit takes God’s image, as if the former were contiguous to the body, and the
latter to God; and that, therefore, it is really the inmost man which is refashioned after the

<pb n="1019"/>
image of God, and not the inner man? Well, but this pretence is useless. For if the inmost
man is as entirely diffused through all the members of the soul, as the inner man of the soul
is through the limbs of the body; even it has now, through the soul, received the image of
the body, as the soul moulded the same; and thus it results that it has no means whereby to
receive God’s image, while the afore-mentioned image of the body remains impressed upon
it; except as in the case of the money which I have just quoted, where there is one form on
the upper surface, and another on the lower one. These are the absurd lengths to which you
are driven, whether you will or no, when you apply to the consideration of the soul the
material ideas of bodily substances. But, as even you yourself with perfect propriety confess,
God is not a body. How, then, could a body receive His image? “I beseech you, brother, that
you be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind;”2483
and cherish not “the carnal mind, which is death.”2484</p>

<p>But you say: “If the soul is incorporeal, what was it that the rich man saw in hell? He
certainly recognised Lazarus; he did [not2485] know Abraham. Whence arose to him the
knowledge of Abraham, who had died so long before?” By using these words, I suppose that
you do not think a man can be recognised and known without his bodily form. To know
yourself, therefore, I imagine that you often stand before your looking-glass, lest by forgetting
your features you should be unable to recognise yourself. But let me ask you, what man does
anybody know more than himself; and whose face can he see less than his own? But who
could possibly know God, whom even you do not doubt to be incorporeal, if knowledge
could not (as you suppose) accrue without bodily shape; that is, if bodies alone can be recognised?
What Christian, however, when discussing subjects of such magnitude and difficulty,
can give such little heed to the inspired word as to say, “If the soul be incorporeal, it must
of necessity lack form”? Have you forgotten that in that word you have read of “a form of
doctrine”? 2486 Have you forgotten, too, that it is written concerning Christ Jesus, previous
to His clothing Himself with humanity, that He was “in the form of God”?2487 How, then,
can you say, “If the soul is incorporeal, it must of necessity lack form;” when you hear of
“the form of God,” whom you acknowledge to be incorporeal; and so express yourself, as if
form could not possibly exist except in bodies?</p>

<p>You also say, that “names cease to be given, when form is not distinguished; and that,
where there is no designation of persons, there is no giving of names.” Your aim is to prove
that Abraham’s soul was corporeal, inasmuch as he could be addressed as “Father Abraham.”
Now, we have already said, that there is form even where there is no body. If, however, you
think that where there are not bodies there is no assigning of names, I must beg of you to
count the names which occur in this passage of Scripture, “But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance,”2488 and tell
me whether you do not recognise the very things of which these are the names; or whether
you recognise them so as to descry some outlines of bodies. Come, tell me, to mention only
love, for instance, what are its members, its figure, its colour? For if you are not yourself
empty-headed, these appurtenances cannot possibly be regarded by you as an empty thing.
Then you go on to say: “The look and form must, of course, be corporeal of him whose help
is implored.” Well, let men hear what you say; and let no one implore God’s help, because
no one can possibly see anything corporeal in Him.</p>

<p>“In short,” you say, “members are in this parable ascribed to the soul, as if it were really
a body.” You will have it, that “by the eye the whole head is understood,” because it is said,
that “he lifted up his eyes.” Again you say, that “by tongues are meant jaws, and by finger
the hand,” because it is said, “Send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
and cool my tongue.”2489 And yet to save yourself from the inconsistency of ascribing corporeal
qualities to God, you say that “by these terms must be understood incorporeal functions
and powers;” because with the greatest propriety you insist on it, that God is not corporeal.
What is the reason, therefore, that the names of these limbs do not argue corporeity
in God, although they do in the case of the soul? Is it that these terms must be understood
literally when spoken of the creature, and only metaphorically and figuratively when predicated
of the Creator? Then you will have to give us wings of literal bodily substance, since it
is not the Creator, but only a human creature, who said, “If I should take my wings like a
dove.”2490 Moreover, if the rich man of the parable had a bodily tongue, on the ground of
his exclaiming, “Let him cool my tongue,” it would look very much as if our tongue, even
while we are in the flesh, itself possessed material hands, because it is written, “Death and
life are in the hands of the tongue.”2491 I suppose it is even to yourself self-evident, that sin
is neither a creature nor a bodily substance; why, then, has it a face? For do you not hear
the psalmist say, “There is no peace in my bones, in the face of my sins”?2492</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Abraham’s Bosom—What It Means.</head>
<p>As to your supposing that “the Abraham’s bosom referred to is corporeal,” and your
further assertion, that “by it is meant his whole body,” I fear that you must be regarded (even
in such a subject) as trying to joke and raise a laugh, instead of acting gravely and seriously.
For you could not else be so foolish as to think that the material bosom of one person could
receive so many souls; nay, to use your own words, “bear the bodies of as many meritorious
men as the angels carry thither, as they did Lazarus.” Unless it happen to be your opinion,
that his soul alone deserved to find its way to the said bosom. If you are not, then, in fun,
and do not wish to make childish mistakes, you must understand by “Abraham’s bosom”
that remote and separate abode of rest and peace in which Abraham now is; and that what
was said to Abraham2493 did not merely refer to him personally, but had reference to his
appointment as the father of many nations,2494 to whom he was presented for imitation as
the first and principal example of faith; even as God willed Himself to be called “the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,” although He is the God of an innumerable
company.</p>

<head>Chapter 25 <del>XVII.</del>—The Disembodied Soul May Think of Itself Under a Bodily
Form.</head>
<p>You must not, however, suppose that I say all this as if denying it to be possible that the
soul of a dead man, like a person asleep, may think either good or evil thoughts in the
similitude of his body. For, in dreams, when we suffer anything harsh and troublesome, we
are, of course, still ourselves; and if the distress do not pass away when we awake, we experience
very great suffering. But to suppose that they are veritable bodies in which we are
hurried, or flit, about hither and thither in dreams, is the idea of a person who has thought
only carelessly on such subjects; for it is in fact mainly by these imaginary sights that the
soul is proved to be non-corporeal; unless you choose to call even the objects which we see
so often in our dreams, besides ourselves, bodies, such as the sky, the earth, the sea, the sun,
the moon, the stars, and rivers, mountains, trees, or animals. Whoever takes these phantoms
to be bodies, is incredibly foolish; although they are certainly very like bodies. Of this character
also are those phenomena which are demonstrably of divine significance, whether
seen in dreams or in a trance. Who can possibly trace out or describe their origin, or the
material of which they consist? It is, beyond question, spiritual, not corporeal. Now things
of this kind, which look like bodies, but are not really corporeal, are formed in the thoughts
of persons when they are awake, and are held in the depths of their memories, and then out
of these secret recesses, by some wonderful and ineffable process, they come out to view in
the operation of our memory, and present themselves as if palpably before our eyes. If,
therefore, the soul were a material body, it could not possibly contain so many things and
such large forms of bodily substances in its scope of thought, and in the spaces of its memory;
for, according to your own definition, “it does not exceed this external body in its own
corporeal substance.” Possessing, therefore, no magnitude of its own, what capacity has it
to hold the images of vast bodies, spaces, and regions? What wonder is it, then, if it actually
itself appears to itself in the likeness of its own body, even when it appears without a body?
For it never appears to itself in dreams with its own body; and yet in the very similitude of
its own body it runs hither and thither through known and unknown places, and beholds
many sad and joyous sights. I suppose, however, that you really would not, yourself, be so
bold as to maintain that there is true corporeity in that form of limb and body which the
soul seems to itself to possess in dreams. For at that rate that will be a real mountain which
it appears to ascend; and that a material house which it seems to enter; and that a veritable
tree, with real wood and bulk, beneath which it apparently reclines; and that actual water
which it imagines itself to drink. All the things with which it is conversant, as if they were
corporeal, would be undoubted bodies, if the soul were itself corporeal, as it ranges about
amongst them all in the likeness of a body.</p>

<head>Chapter 26 <del>XVIII.</del>—St. Perpetua Seemed to Herself, in Some Dreams, to Have
Been Turned into a Man, and Then Have Wrestled with a Certain Egyptian.</head>
<p>Some notice must be taken of sundry accounts of martyrs’ visions, because you have
thought proper to derive some of your evidence therefrom. St. Perpetua, for instance, seemed
to herself in dreams to be wrestling with an Egyptian, after being changed into a man. Now,
who can doubt that it was her soul in that apparent bodily form, not her body, which, of
course, remained in her own sex as a woman, and lay on the bed with her senses steeped in
sleep, whilst her soul was struggling in the similitude of a man’s body? What have you to
say to this? Was that male likeness a veritable body, or was it no body at all, although possessing
the appearance of a body? Choose your alternative. If it was a body, why did it not
maintain its sexual integrity? For in that woman’s flesh were found no virile functions of
generation, whence by any such process as that which you call congelation could be moulded
this similitude of a man’s body. We will conclude then, if you please, that, as her body was
still alive while she slept, notwithstanding the wrestling of her soul, she remained in her
own natural sex, enclosed, of course, in all her proper limbs which belong to her in her living
state, and was still in possession of that bodily shape and the lineaments of which she had
been originally formed. She had not resigned, as she would by death, her joints and limbs;
nor had she withdrawn from the transposing power, which arises from the operation of the
power of death, any of her members which had already received their fixed form. Whence,
then, did her soul get that virile body in which she seemed to wrestle with her adversary?
If, however, this [male likeness] was not a body, although such a semblance of one as admitted
the sensation in it of a real struggle or a real joy, do you not by this time see, as far as may
be, that there can be in the soul a certain resemblance of a bodily substance, while the soul
is not itself a body?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Is the Soul Wounded When the Body is Wounded?</head>
<p>What, then, if some such thing is exhibited among the departed; and souls recognise
themselves among them, not, indeed, by bodies, but by the semblances of bodies? Now,
when we suffer pain, if only in our dreams, although it is only the similitude of bodily limbs
which is in action, and not the bodily limbs themselves, still the pain is not merely in
semblance, but in reality; as is also the case in the instance of joyous sensations. Inasmuch,
however, as St. Perpetua was not yet dead, you probably are unwilling to lay down a precise
rule for yourself from that circumstance (although it bears strongly on the question), as to
what nature you will suppose those semblances of bodies to partake of, which we have in
our dreams. If you allow them to be like bodies, but not bodies actually, then the entire
question would be settled. But her brother Dinocrates was dead; she saw him with the wound
which he received while alive, and which caused his death. Where is the ground for the
earnest contention to which you devoted your efforts, when you laboured to show, that
when a limb is cut off, the soul must not be supposed as suffering a like amount of loss by
amputation? Observe, the wound was inflicted on the soul of Dinocrates, expelling it by its
force from his body, when it was inhabiting that body. How, then, can your opinion be
correct, that “when the limbs of the body are cut off, the soul withdraws itself from the
stroke, and after condensation retires to other parts, so that no portion of it is amputated
with the wound inflicted on the body,” even if the person be asleep and unconscious when
the loss of limb is suffered? So great is the vigilance which you have ascribed to the soul,
that even should the stroke fall on any part of the flesh without its knowledge, when it is
absorbed in the visions of dreams, it would instantly, and by a providential instinct, withdraw
itself, and so render it impossible for any blow, or injury, or mutilation to be inflicted upon
it. However, you may, as much as you will, ransack your ingenuity for an answer to the
natural question, how the soul withdraws the portions of its own existence, and retreats
within itself, so that, whenever a limb of the body is cut off or broken, it does not suffer any
amputation or fracture in itself; but I cannot help asking you to look at the case of Dinocrates,
and to explain to me why his soul did not withdraw from that part of his body which received
the mortal wound, and so escape from suffering in itself what was plainly enough seen in
his face, even after his body was dead? Is it, perchance, your good pleasure that we should
suppose the phenomena in question to be rather the semblances of bodies than the reality;
so that as that which is really no wound seems to be a wound, so that which is no body at
all wears the appearance of corporeity? If, indeed, the soul can be wounded by those who
wound the body, should we not have good reason to fear that it can be killed also by those
who kill the body? This, however, is a fate which the Lord Himself most plainly declares it
to be impossible to happen.2495 And the soul of Dinocrates could not at any rate have died
<note type="footnote">2495 Matt. x. 28.</note>

<pb n="1027"/>
of the blow which killed his body: its wound, too, was only an apparent one; for not being
corporeal, it was not really wounded, as the body had been; possessing the likeness of the
body, it shared also the resemblance of its wound. Still it may be further said, that in its
unreal body the soul felt a real misery, which was signified by the shadow of the body’s
wound. It was from this real misery that he earned deliverance by the prayers of his holy
sister.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Is the Soul Deformed by the Body’s Imperfections?</head>
<p>Now, again, what means it that you say, “The soul acquires form from the body, and
grows and extends with the increase of the body,” without keeping in view what a monstrosity
the soul of either a young man or an old man would become if his arm had been amputated
when he was an infant? “The hand of the soul,” you say, “contracts itself, so that it is not
amputated with the hand of the body, and by condensation it shrinks into other parts of the
body.” At this rate the aforesaid arm of the soul will be kept, wherever it holds its ground,
as short as it was at first when it received the form of the body, because it has lost the form
by the growth of which it might itself have increased at an equal degree of expansion. Thus
the soul of the young man or the old man who lost his hand in his infancy advances with
two hands, indeed (because the one which shrank back escaped the amputation of the
bodily limb), but one of these was the hand of an adult, young or old, according to the hypothesis,
while the other was only an infant’s hand, just as it was when the amputation
happened. Such souls, believe me, are not made in the mould and form of the body, but
they are fictitiously framed under the deformed stamp of error. It seems to me impossible
for you to be rescued from this error, unless with God’s help you fully and calmly examine
the visions of those who dream, and from these convince yourself that some forms are not
real bodies, but only the semblances of bodies. Now, although even those objects which we
suppose to be like bodies are of the same class,2496 yet so far as the dead are concerned, we
can form an after guess about them from persons who are asleep. For it is not in vain that
Holy Scripture describes as “asleep” those who are dead2497 were it only because in a certain
sense “sleep is akin to death.”2498</p>

<head>Chapter 29 <del>XIX.</del>—Does the Soul Take the Body’s Clothes Also Away with It?</head>
<p>If, indeed, the soul were body, and the form were also a corporeal figure in which it sees
itself in dreams, on the ground that it received its expression from the body in which it is
enclosed: not a human being, if he lost a limb, would in dreams see himself bereft of the
amputated member, although actually deprived of it. On the contrary, he would always appear
to himself entire and unmutilated, from the circumstance that no part has been cut away
from the soul itself. But since persons sometimes see themselves whole and sometimes
mutilated in limb, when this happens to be their actual plight, what else does this fact show
than that the soul, both in respect of other things seen by it in dreams and in reference to
the body, bears about, hither and thither, not their reality, but only their resemblance? The
soul’s joy, however, or sadness, its pleasure or pain, are severally real emotions, whether
experienced in actual or in apparent bodies. Have you not yourself said (and with perfect
truth): “Aliments and vestments are not wanted by the soul, but only by the body”? Why,
then, did the rich man in hell crave for the drop of water?2499 Why did holy Samuel appear
after his death (as you have yourself noticed) clothed in his usual garments?2500 Did the
one wish to repair the ruins of the soul, as of the flesh, by the aliment of water? Did the
other quit life with his clothes on him? Now in the former case there was a real suffering,
which tormented the soul; but not a real body, such as required food. While the latter might
have seemed to be clothed, not as being a veritable body, but a soul only, having the semblance
of a body with a dress. For although the soul extends and contracts itself to suit the
members of the body, it does not similarly adapt itself to the clothes, so as to fit its form to
them.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—Is Corporeity Necessary for Recognition?</head>
<p>But who is able to trace out what capacity of recognition even souls which are not good
possess after death when relieved of the corruptible bodies, so as to be able by an inner sense
to observe and recognise either souls that are evil like themselves, or even good ones, either
in states which are actually not corporeal, but the semblances of bodies; or else in good or
evil affections of the mind, in which there occur no lineaments whatever of bodily members?
Whence arises the fact that the rich man in the parable, though in torments, recognised
“Father Abraham,” whose face and figure he had never seen, but the semblance of whose
body his soul, though incorporeal, was able to comprehend?2501 But who could rightly say
that he had known any man, except in so far as he has had means of knowing his life and
disposition, which have, of course, neither material substance nor colours? It is in this way
that we know ourselves more certainly than any others, because our own consciousness and
disposition are all before us. This we plainly perceive, and yet we see therein no similitude
of a bodily substance. But we do not perceive this inner quality of our nature in another
man, even if he be present before our eyes; though in his absence we recollect his features,
and recognise them, and think of them. Our own features, however, we cannot in the same
manner recollect, and recognise, and think of; and yet with most perfect truth we say that
we are ourselves better known to ourselves than he is, so manifest is it where lies the stronger
and truer knowledge of man.</p>

non-corporeal likenesses of bodies (and by this we can have a view of ourselves also, as not
otherwise than like to bodies); and a third, by which we gain a still surer and stronger insight
into objects fitted for its faculty, which are neither corporeal nor are like bodily substances,—
such as faith, hope, charity,—things which have neither complexion, nor passion,
nor any such thing: on which of these functions ought we to dwell more intently, and to
some degree more familiarly, and where be renewed in the knowledge of God after the image

members characteristic of man and woman, being no semblance merely of body, but actual
body, is either a male or a female, whether you will or no, precisely as it appears to be a man
or a woman. But if your opinion be correct, and the soul is a body, even a living body, then
it both possesses swelling and pendent breasts, and lacks a beard, it has a womb, and all the
generative organs of a woman, yet is not a woman after all. Will not mine, then, be a statement
more consistent with truth: the soul, indeed, has an eye and has a tongue, has a finger, and
all other members which resemble those of the body, and yet the whole is the semblance of
a body, not a body really? My statement is open to a general test; everybody can prove it in
himself, when he brings home to his mind the image of absent friends; he can prove it with
certainty when he recalls the figures both of himself and other persons, which have occurred
to him in his dreams. On your part, however, no example can throughout nature be produced
of such a monstrosity as you have imagined, where there is a woman’s real and living body,

<head>Chapter 33.—The Phenix After Death Coming to Life Again.</head>
<p>Now, what you say about the phenix has nothing whatever to do with the subject before
us. For the phenix symbolizes the resurrection of the body; it does not do away with the sex
of souls; if indeed, as is thought, he is born afresh after his death. I suppose, however, that
you thought your discourse would not be sufficiently plausible unless you declaimed a good
deal about the phenix, after the fashion of young people. Now do you find in the body of
your bird male organs of generation and not a male bird; or female ones, and not a female?
But, I beg of you, reflect on what it is you say,—what theory you are trying to construct, and
to recommend for our acceptance. You say that the soul, spread through all the limbs of the
body, grew stiff by congelation, and received the entire shape of the whole body from the
crown of the head to the soles of the feet, and from the inmost marrow to the skin’s outward
surface. At this rate it must have received, in the case of a female body, all the inner appurtenances
of a woman’s body, and yet not be a woman! Why, pray, are all the members
feminine in a true living body, and yet the whole no woman? And why all be male, and the
result not a man? Who can be so presumptuous as to believe, and profess, and teach all this?
Is it that souls never generate? Then, of course, mules and she-mules are not male and female.
Is it that souls without bodies of flesh would be unable to cohabit? Well, but this deprivation
is shared by castrated men; and yet, although both the process and the motion be taken
from them, their sex is not removed—some slender remnant of their male members being
still left to them. Nobody ever said that a eunuch is not a male. What now becomes of your
opinion, that the souls even of eunuchs have the generative organs unimpaired, and that
these organs will remain entire, on your principle, in their souls, even when they are clean
removed from their bodily structure? For you say, the soul knows how to withdraw itself
when that part of the flesh begins to be cut off, so that the form which has been removed
when amputated is not lost; but although spread over it by condensation, it retires by an
extremely rapid movement, and so buries itself within as to be kept quite safe; yet that cannot,
forsooth, be a male in the other world which carries with it thither the whole appendage of
male organs of generation, and which, if it had not even other signs in the body, was a male
by reason of those organs alone. These opinions, my son, have no truth in them; if you will
not allow that there is sex in the soul, there cannot be a body either.</p>

<head>Chapter 34 <del>XXI.</del>—Prophetic Visions.</head>
<p>Not every semblance of a body is itself a body. Fall asleep and you will see this; but when
you awake again, carefully discern what it is you have seen. For in your dreams you will
appear to yourself as if endued with a body; but it really is not your body, but your soul; nor
is it a real body, but the semblance of a body. Your body will be lying on the bed, but the
soul walking; the tongue of your body will be silent, but that of your soul in the dream will
talk; your eyes will be shut, but your soul will be awake; and, of course, the limbs of your
body stretched out in your bed will be alive, not dead. Consequently that congealed form,
as you regard it, of your soul is not yet extracted, as it were, out of its sheath; and yet in it is
seen the whole and perfect semblance of your fleshly frame. Belonging to this class of
similitudes of corporeity, which are not real bodies, though they seem to be such, are all
those appearances which you read of in the Holy Scriptures in the visions even of the
prophets, without, however, understanding them; by which are also signified the things
which come to pass in all time—present, past, and future. You make mistakes about these,
not because they are in themselves deceptive, but because you do not accept them as they
ought to be taken. For in the same apocalyptic vision where “the souls of the martyrs” are
seen,2502 there is also beheld “a lamb as it were slain, having seven horns:”2503 there are also
horses and other animals figuratively described with all consistency;2504 and lastly, there
were the stars falling, and the earth rolled up like a book;2505 nor does the world, in spite
of all, then actually collapse. If therefore we understand all these things wisely, although we

ones, appear in this manner,2506 whenever they appear in the likeness of human beings or
of any bodies whatever; or whether they possess real bodies, and show themselves in this
veritable state of corporeity; or, again, whether by persons when dreaming, indeed, or in a
trance they are perceived in these forms—not in bodies, but in the likeness of bodies—while
to persons when awake they present real bodies which can be seen, and, if necessary, actually
touched. Such questions as these, however, I do not deem it at all requisite to investigate
and fully treat in this book. By this time enough has been advanced respecting the soul’s
incorporeity. If you would rather persist in your opinion that it is corporeal, you must first
of all define what “body” means; lest, peradventure, it may turn out that we are agreed about
the thing itself, but labouring to no purpose about its name. The absurd conclusions, however,
to which you would be reduced if you thought of such a body in the soul, as are those substances
which are called “bodies” by all learned men,—I mean such as occupy portions of
space, smaller ones for their smaller parts, and larger ones for their larger,—by means of
the different relations of length and breadth and thickness, I venture to think you are by

<head>Chapter 36 <del>XXII.</del>—He Passes on to the Second Question About the Soul, Whether
It is Called Spirit.</head>
<p>It now remains for me to show how it is that while the designation spirit is rightly predicated
of a part of the soul, not the whole of it,—even as the apostle says, “Your whole
spirit, and soul, and body;”2507 or, according to the much more expressive statement in the
Book of Job, “Thou wilt separate my soul from my spirit,”2508—yet the whole soul is also
called by this name; although this question seems to be much more a question of names
than of things. For since it is certainly a fact that there is a something in the soul which is
properly called “spirit,” while (this being left out of question) it is also designated with equal
propriety “soul,” our present contention is not about the things themselves;2509 mainly because
I on my side certainly admit, and you on your part say the same, that that is properly
called spirit by which we reason and understand, and yet that these things are distinguishingly
designated, as the apostle says “your whole spirit, and soul, and body.” This spirit, however,
the same apostle appears also to describe as mind; as when he says, “So then with the mind
I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.” 2510 Now the meaning of this is
precisely what he expresses in another passage thus: “For the flesh lusteth against the spirit,
and the spirit against the flesh.”2511 What he designates mind in the former place, he must
be understood to call spirit in the latter passage. Not as you interpret the statement, “The
whole mind is meant, which consists of soul and spirit,”—a view which I know not where
you obtained. By our “mind,” indeed, we usually understand nothing but our rational and
intellectual faculty; and thus, when the apostle says, “Be ye renewed in the spirit of your
mind,”2512 what else does he mean than, Be ye renewed in your mind? “The spirit of the
mind” is, accordingly, nothing else than the mind, just as “the body of the flesh” is nothing
but the flesh; thus it is written, “In putting off the body of the flesh,”2513 where the apostle
calls the flesh “the body of the flesh.” He designates it, indeed, in another point of view as
the spirit of man, which he quite distinguishes from the mind: “If,” says he, “I pray with the

tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my mind is unfruitful.”2514 We are not now, however,
speaking of that spirit which is distinct from the mind; and this involves a question relating
to itself which is really a difficult one. For in many ways and in divers senses the Holy
Scriptures make mention of the spirit; but with respect to that we are now speaking of, by
which we exercise reason, intelligence, and wisdom, we are both agreed that it is called (and
indeed rightly called) “spirit,” in such a sense as not to include the entire soul, but a part of
it. If, however, you contend that the soul is not the spirit, on the ground that the understanding
is distinctly called “spirit,” you may as well deny that the whole seed of Jacob is called
Israel, since, apart from Judah, the same appellation was distinctly and separately borne by
the ten tribes which were then organized in Samaria. But why need we linger any longer
here on this subject?</p>

<head>Chapter 37 <del>XXIII.</del>—Wide and Narrow Sense of the Word “Spirit.”</head>
<p>But now, with a view to our easier elucidation, I beg you to observe that what is the soul
is also designated spirit in the scripture which narrates an incident in our Lord’s death, thus,
“He bowed His head and gave up the spirit.”2515 Now, when you hear or read these words,
you wish to understand them as if the whole were signified by a part, and not because that
which is the soul may also be called spirit. But I shall, for the purpose of being able the more
readily to prove what I say, actually summon yourself with all promptitude and convenience
as my witness. For you have defined spirit in such terms that cattle appear not to have a
spirit, but a soul. Irrational animals are so called, because they have not the power of intelligence
and reason. Accordingly, when you admonished man himself to know his own nature,
you spoke as follows: “Now, inasmuch as the good God has made nothing without a purpose,
He has produced man himself as a rational animal, capable of intelligence, endowed with
reason, and enlivened by sensibility, so as to be able to distribute in a wise arrangement all
things that are void of reason.” In these words of yours you have plainly asserted what is
certainly most true, that man is endowed with reason and capable of intelligence, which, of
course, animals void of reason are not. And you have, in accordance with this view, quoted
a passage of Scripture, and, adopting its language, have compared men of no understanding
to the cattle, which, of course, have not intellect.2516 A statement the like to which occurs
in another passage of Scripture: “Be ye not as the horse or as the mule, which have no understanding.”
2517 This being the case, I want you also to observe in what terms you have
defined and described the spirit when trying to distinguish it from the soul: “This soul,” you
say, “which has its origin from the breath of God, could not have possibly been without an
inner sense and intellect of its own; and this is the spirit.” A little afterwards you add: “And
although the soul animates the body, yet inasmuch as it possesses sense, and wisdom, and
vigour, there must needs be a spirit.” And then somewhat further on you say: “The soul is
one thing, and the spirit—which is the soul’s wisdom and sense—is another.” In these words
you plainly enough indicate what you take the spirit of man to mean; that it is even our rational
faculty, whereby the soul exercises sense and intelligence,—not, indeed, the sensation
which is felt by the bodily senses, but the operation of that innermost sense from which
arises the term sentiment. Owing to this it is, no doubt, that we are placed above brute animals,
since these are unendowed with reason. These animals therefore have not spirit,—that
is to say, intellect and a sense of reason and wisdom,—but only soul. For it is of these that
it was spoken, “Let the waters bring forth the creeping creatures that have a living soul;”2518

<note type="footnote">2516 Ps. xlix. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">2517 Ps. xxxii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2518 Gen. i. 20.</note>

<pb n="1039"/>
and again, “Let the earth bring forth the living soul.”2519 In order, indeed, that you may
have the fullest and clearest assurance that what is the soul is in the usage of the Holy
Scriptures also called spirit, the soul of a brute animal has the designation of spirit. And of
course cattle have not that spirit which you, my beloved brother, have defined as being distinct
from the soul. It is therefore quite evident that the soul of a brute animal could be
rightly called “spirit” in a general sense of the term; as we read in the Book of Ecclesiastes,
“Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of men, whether it goeth upward; and the spirit of the
beast, whether it goeth downward into the earth?”2520 In like manner, touching the devastation
of the deluge, the Scripture testifies, “All flesh died that moved upon the earth, both
of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth,
and every man: and all things which have the spirit of life.”2521 Here, if we remove all the
windings of doubtful disputation, we understand the term spirit to be synonymous with
soul in its general sense. Of so wide a signification is this term, that even God is called “a
spirit;”2522 and a stormy blast of the air, although it has material substance, is called by the
psalmist the “spirit” of a tempest.2523 For all these reasons, therefore, you will no longer
deny that what is the soul is called also spirit; I have, I think, adduced enough from the pages
of Holy Scripture to secure your assent in passages where the soul of the very brute beast,
which has no understanding, is designated spirit. If, then, you take and wisely consider what
has been advanced in our discussion about the incorporeity of the soul, there is no further
reason why you should take offence at my having said that I was sure the soul was not body,
but spirit,—both because it is proved to be not corporeal, and because in its general sense
it is denominated spirit.</p>

<head>Chapter 38 <del>XXIV.</del>—Victor’s Chief Errors Again Pointed Out.</head>
<p>Wherefore if you take these books, which I have with a sincere and affectionate interest
written in answer to your opinions, and read them with a reciprocal love for me; if you attend
to what you have yourself declared in the beginning of your first book, and “are anxious not
to insist on any opinion of your own, if it be found an improbable one,”2524 then I beseech
you to beware especially of those eleven errors which I warned you of in the preceding book
of this treatise.2525 Do not say, that “the soul is of God in such a sense that He created it not
out of no, nor out of another, but out of His own nature;” or that, “as God who gives is
Himself ever existent, so is He ever giving souls through infinite time;” or that “the soul lost
some merit through the flesh, which it had previous to the flesh;” or that “the soul by means
of the flesh repairs its ancient condition, and is born again through the very same flesh, by
which it had deserved to be polluted;” or that “the soul deserved to be sinful even prior to
sin;” or that “infants who die without the regeneration of baptism, may yet attain to forgiveness
of their original sins;” or that “they whom the Lord has predestinated to be baptized
can be taken away from His predestination, or die before that has been accomplished in
them which the Almighty had predetermined;” or that “it is of those who expire before they
are baptized that the Scripture says, ‘Speedily was he taken away, lest wickedness should
alter his understanding,’”—with the remainder of the passage to the same effect; or that
“there are some mansions outside the kingdom of God, belonging to the ‘many,’ which the
Lord said were in His Father’s house;” or that “the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ
ought to be offered in behalf of those who have departed out of the body without being
baptized;” or that “any of those persons who die without Christ’s baptism, are received for
a while into paradise, and afterwards attain even to the blessedness of the kingdom of
heaven.” Above all things, beware of these opinions, my son, and, as you wish to be the
vanquisher of error, do not rejoice in the surname of “Vincentius.” And when you are ignorant
on any subject, do not think that you know it; but in order to get real knowledge, learn
how to be ignorant. For we commit a sin by affecting to be ignorant of nothing among “the
secret things of God;” by constructing random theories about unknown things, and taking
them for known; and by producing and defending errors as if they were truth. As for my
own ignorance on the question whether the souls of men are created afresh at every birth,
or are transmitted by the parents (an ignorance which is, however, modified by my belief,
which it would be impious to falter in, that they are certainly made by the Divine Creator,
though not of His own substance), I think that your loving self will by this time be persuaded
that it either ought not to be censured at all, or, if it ought, that it should be done by a man
who is capable by his learning of removing it altogether; and so also with respect to my

other opinions, that while souls have in them the incorporeal semblances of bodies, they
are not themselves bodies; and that, without impairing the natural distinction between soul
and spirit, the soul is in a general sense actually designated spirit. If, indeed, I have unfortunately
failed to persuade you, I must leave it rather to my readers to determine whether
what I have advanced ought not to have convinced you.</p>

<head>Chapter 39.—Concluding Admonition.</head>
<p>If, as may possibly be the case, you desire to know whether there are many other points
which appear to me to require emendation in your books, it cannot be troublesome for you
to come to me,—not, indeed, as a scholar to his master, but as a person in his prime to one
full of years, and as a strong man to a weak one. And although you ought not to have published
your books, still there is a greater and a truer glory in a man’s being censured, when
he confesses with his own lips the justice of his correction, than in being lauded out of the
mouth of any defender of error. Now, while I should be unwilling to believe that all those
who listened to your reading of the afore-mentioned books, and lavished their praises on
you, had either previously held for themselves the opinions which sound doctrine disapproves
of, or were induced by you to entertain them, I still cannot help thinking that they had the
keenness of their mind blunted by the impetuous and constant flow of your elocution, and
so were unable to bestow adequate attention on the contents of your discourse; or else, that
when they were in any case capable of understanding what you said, it was less for any very
clear statement of the truth that they praised you than for the affluence of your language,
and the facility and resources of your mental powers. For praise, and fame, and kindly regard
are very commonly bestowed on a young man’s eloquence in anticipation of the future,
though as yet it lacks the mellowed perfection and fidelity of a fully-informed instructor.
In order, then, that you may attain to true wisdom yourself, and that what you say may be
able not only to delight, but even edify other people, it behoves you, after removing from
your mind the dangerous applause of others, to keep conscientious watch over your own
words.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Introduction: Address to Boniface.</head>
<p>I Had indeed known you by the praise of your renowned fame; and by very numerous
and veracious messengers I had learned how full you were of the grace of God, most blessed
and venerable Pope Boniface! But after my brother Alypius saw you even in bodily presence;
and, having been received by you with all kindness and sincerity, held, at the bidding of affection,
conversations with you; and living with you, and, although only for a short time,
united with you in earnest affection, poured out to your mind both himself and me; and
brought you back to me in his mind:—the more assured was your friendship, the greater
became in me the conviction of your holiness. For you, who mind not high things, however
loftily you are placed, did not disdain to be a friend of the lowly and to return the love bestowed
upon you. For what else is friendship which has its name from no other source than
love,2527 and is nowhere faithful but in Christ, in whom alone it can be eternal and happy?
Whence, also, having received a greater assurance by means of that brother, through whom
I have learned to know you more familiarly, I have ventured to write something to your
blessedness concerning those things which at this juncture are claiming by a later stimulus
the episcopal care, as far as we are able, to vigilance on behalf of the Lord’s flock.</p>

<p>For the new heretics, enemies of the grace of God which is given by Jesus Christ our
Lord to small and great, although they are already shown more openly to need to be avoided
by a manifest disapprobation, still do not cease by their writings to try the hearts of the less
cautious and less learned. And these must certainly be answered, lest they should confirm
themselves or their friends in that wicked error; even if we were not afraid that they might
deceive some one of the catholics by their plausible discourse. But since they do not cease
to growl at the entrances to the Lord’s fold, and from every side to tear open approaches
with a view to tear in pieces the sheep redeemed at such a price; and since the pastoral watchtower
is common to all of us who discharge the office of the episcopate (although you are
prominent therein on a loftier height), I do what I can in respect of my small portion of the
charge, as the Lord condescends by the aid of your prayers to grant me power, to oppose to
their pestilent and crafty writings, healing and defensive writings, so that the madness with
which they are raging may either itself be cured, or may be prevented from hurting others.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Why He Addresses His Book to Boniface.</head>
<p>But these words which I am answering to their two letters,—the one, to wit, which Julian
is said to have sent to Rome, that by its means, as I believe, he might find or make as many
allies as he could; and the other, which eighteen so-called bishops, sharers in his error, dared
to write to Thessalonica, not to any and every body, but to the bishop of that place itself,
with a view of tempting him by their craftiness and bringing him over, if it could be done,
to their views;—these words which, as I said, I am writing in answer to those two letters of
theirs in respect of that argument, I have determined to address especially to your sanctity,
not so much for your learning as for your examination and, if perchance anything should
displease you, for your correction. For my brother intimated to me that you yourself condescended
to give those letters to him, which could not come into your hands except by the
most watchful diligence of my brethren, your sons. And I thank your most sincere kindness
to me that you have been unwilling that those letters of the enemies of God’s grace should
be hidden from me, seeing that in them you have found my name calumniously as well as
openly expressed. But I hope from my Lord God that not without the reward which is in
heaven do those tear me with their scurrilous teeth to whom I oppose myself on behalf of
the little ones, that they may not be left for destruction to the deceitful flatterer Pelagius,
but may be presented for deliverance to the truthful Saviour Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 4 <del>II.</del>—The Calumny of Julian,—That the Catholics Teach that Free Will

<p>Let us now, therefore, reply to Julian’s letter. “Those Manicheans say,” says he, “with
whom now we do not communicate,—that is, the whole of them with whom we differ,—that
by the sin of the first man, that is, of Adam, free will perished: and that no one has now the
power of living well, but that all are constrained into sin by the necessity of their flesh.” He
calls the catholics Manicheans, after the manner of that Jovinian who a few years ago, as a
new heretic, destroyed the virginity of the blessed Mary, and placed the marriage of the
faithful on the same level with her sacred virginity. And he did not object this to the catholics
on any other ground than that he wished them to seem to be either accusers or condemners
of marriage.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Free Choice Did Not Perish With Adam ’s Sin. What Freedom Did
Perish.</head>
<p>But in defending free will they hasten to confide rather in it for doing righteousness
than in God’s aid, and to glory every one in himself, and not in the Lord.2528 But who of us
will say that by the sin of the first man free will perished from the human race? Through
sin freedom indeed perished, but it was that freedom which was in Paradise, to have a full
righteousness with immortality; and it is on this account that human nature needs divine
grace, since the Lord says, “If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed”
2529—free of course to live well and righteously. For free will in the sinner up to this
extent did not perish,—that by it all sin, especially they who sin with delight and with love
of sin; what they are pleased to do gives them pleasure. Whence also the apostle says, “When
ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.”2530 Behold, they are shown
to have been by no means able to serve sin except by another freedom. They are not, then,
free from righteousness except by the choice of the will, but they do not become free from
sin save by the grace of the Saviour. For which reason the admirable Teacher also distinguished
these very words: “For when ye were the servants,” says he, “of sin, ye were free
from righteousness. What fruit had ye, then, in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
for the end of those things is death. But now being freed from sin and become servants to
God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.”2531 He called them “free”
from righteousness, not “freed;” but from sin not “free,” lest they should attribute this to
themselves, but most watchfully he preferred to say “freed,” referring this to that declaration
of the Lord, “If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.”2532 Since, then,
the sons of men do not live well unless they are made the sons of God, why is it that this
writer wishes to give the power of good living to free will, when this power is not given save
by God’s grace through Jesus Christ our Lord, as the gospel says: “And as many as received
Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God”?2533</p>

<head>Chapter 6 <del>III.</del>—Grace is Not Given According to Merits.</head>
<p>But lest perchance they say that they are aided to this,—that they may “have power to
become the sons of God,” but that they may deserve to receive this power they have first
“received Him” by free will with no assistance of grace (because this is the purpose of their
endeavour to destroy grace, that they may contend that it is given according to our deservings);
lest perchance, then, they so divide that evangelical statement as to refer merit to
that portion of it wherein it is said, “But as many as received Him,” and then say that in that
which follows, “He gave them power to become the sons of God,” grace is not given freely,
but is repaid to this merit; if it is asked of them what is the meaning of “received Him,” will
they say anything else than “believed on Him”? And in order, therefore, that they may know
that this also pertains to grace, let them read what the apostle says: “And that ye be in
nothing terrified by your adversaries, which indeed is to them a cause of perdition, but of
your salvation, and that of God; for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to
believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.”2534 Certainly he said that both were given.
Let them read what he said also: “Peace be to the brethren, and love, with faith from God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”2535 Let them also read what the Lord Himself says:
“No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me shall draw him.”2536 Where,
lest any one should suppose that anything else is said in the words “come to me” than “believe
in me,” a little after, when He was speaking of His body and blood, and many were offended
at His discourse, He says, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and life; but
there are some of you which believe not.”2537 Then the Evangelist added, “For Jesus knew
from the beginning who they were that believed, and who should betray Him. And He said,
Therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given him of my
Father.”2538 He repeated, to wit, the saying in which He had said, “No man can come unto
me, except the Father who hath sent me shall draw him.” And He declared that He said this
for the sake of believers and unbelievers, explaining what He had said, “except the Father
who hath sent me shall draw him,” by repeating the very same thing in other words in that
which He said, “except it were given him of my Father.” Because he is drawn to Christ to
whom it is given to believe on Christ. Therefore the power is given that they who believe
on Him should become the sons of God, since this very thing is given, that they believe on
Him. And unless this power be given from God, out of free will there can be none; because
it will not be free for good if the deliverer have not made it free; but in evil he has a free will

<head>Chapter 7.—He Concludes that He Does Not Deprive the Wicked of Free Will.</head>
<p>It is not, therefore, true, as some affirm that we say, and as that correspondent of yours
ventures moreover to write, that “all are forced into sin,” as if they were unwilling, “by the
necessity of their flesh;” but if they are already of the age to use the choice of their own mind,
they are both retained in sin by their own will, and by their own will are hurried along from
sin to sin. For even he who persuades and deceives does not act in them, except that they
may commit sin by their will, either by ignorance of the truth or by delight in iniquity, or
by both evils,—as well of blindness as of weakness. But this will, which is free in evil things
because it takes pleasure in evil, is not free in good things, for the reason that it has not been
made free. Nor can a man will any good thing unless he is aided by Him who cannot will
evil,—that is, by the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. For “everything which is
not of faith is sin.” 2539 And thus the good will which withdraws itself from sin is faithful,
because the just lives by faith.2540 And it pertains to faith to believe on Christ. And no man
can believe on Christ—that is, come to Him—unless it be given to him.2541 No man,
therefore, can have a righteous will, unless, with no foregoing merits, he has received the
true, that is, the gratuitous grace from above.</p>

<p>These proud and haughty people will not have this; and yet they do not maintain free
will by purifying it, but demolish it by exaggerating it. For they are angry with us who say
these things, for no other reason than that they disdain to glory in the Lord. Yet Pelagius
feared the episcopal judgment of Palestine; and when it was objected to him that he said
that the grace of God is given according to our merits, he denied that he said so, and condemned
those who said this with an anathema.2542 And yet nothing else is found to be de-

<head>Chapter 9 <del>V.</del>—Another Calumny of Julian,—That “It is Said that Marriage is Not
Appointed by God.”</head>
<p>But now let us see what follows. “They say also,” he says, “that those marriages which
are now celebrated were not appointed by God, and this is to be read in Augustin’s book,2544
against which I replied in four books. And the words of this Augustin our enemies have
taken up by way of hostility to the truth.” To these most calumnious words I see that a brief
answer must be made, because he repeats them afterwards when he wishes to insinuate what
such men as they would say, as if against my words. On that point, with God’s assistance, I
must contend with him as far as the matter shall seem to demand. Now, therefore, I reply
that marriage was ordained by God both then, when it was said, “Therefore shall a man
leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be two in one
flesh,”2545 and now, wherefore it is written, “A woman is joined to a man by the Lord.”2546
For nothing else is even now done than that a man cleave to his wife, and they become two
in one flesh. Because concerning that very marriage which is now contracted, the Lord was
consulted by the Jews whether it was lawful for any cause to put away a wife. And to the
testimony of the law on the occasion mentioned, He added, “What, therefore, God hath
joined together, let not man put asunder.”2547 The Apostle Paul also applied this witness
of the law when he admonished husbands that their wives should be loved by them.2548
Away, then, with the notion that in my book that man should read anything opposed to
these divine testimonies! But either by not understanding, or rather by calumniating, he
seeks to twist what he reads into another meaning. But I wrote my book, against which he
mentions that he replied in four books, after the condemnation of Pelagius and Coelestius.
And this, I have thought, must be said, because that man avers that my words had been
taken up by his enemies in hostility to the truth, lest any one should think that these new
heretics were condemned as enemies of the grace of Christ on account of this book of mine.
But in that book is found the defence rather than the censure of marriage.</p>

Condemned.</head>
<p>“They say also,” says he, “that sexual impulse and the intercourse of married people
were devised by the devil, and that therefore those who are born innocent are guilty, and
that it is the work of the devil, not of God, that they are born of this diabolical intercourse.
And this, without any ambiguity, is Manicheism.” Nay, as I say that marriage was appointed
by God for the sake of the ordinance of the begetting of children, so I say that the propagation
of children to be begotten could not have taken place without sexual impulse, and without
intercourse of husband and wife, even in Paradise, if children were begotten there. But
whether such impulse and intercourse would have existed, as is now the case with shameful
lust, if no one had sinned, here is the question concerning which I shall argue hereafter, if
God will.</p>

<p>Yet what it is they wish, what they purpose, to what result they are striving to bring the
matter, the words that are added by that writer declare, when he asserts that I say, “that
therefore they who are born innocent are guilty, and that it is the work of the devil, not of
God, that they are born of this diabolical intercourse.” Since, therefore, I neither say that
this intercourse of husband and wife is diabolical, especially in the case of believers, which
is effected for the sake of generating children who are afterwards to be regenerated; nor that
any men are made by the devil, but, in so far as they are men, by God; and nevertheless that
even of believing husband and wife are born guilty persons (as if a wild olive were produced
from an olive),2549 on account of original sin, and on this account they are under the devil
unless they are born again in Christ, because the devil is the author of the fault, not of the
nature: what, on the other hand, are they labouring to bring about who say that infants inherit
no original sin, and therefore are not under the devil, except that that grace of God in
infants may be made of no effect, by which He has plucked us out, as the apostle says, from
the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love?2550
<del>VII.</del> When, indeed, they deny that infants are in the power of darkness even before the
help of the Lord the deliverer, they are in such wise praising in them the Creator’s work as
to destroy the mercy of the Redeemer. And because I confess this both in grown-up people
and in infants, he says that this is without any ambiguity Manicheism, although it is the
most ancient catholic dogma by which the new heretical dogma of these men is overturned.</p>

<p>“They say,” says he, “that the saints in the Old Testament were not without sins,—that
is that they were not free from crimes even by amendment, but they were seized by death

were freed from sins,—not by their own power, because “cursed is every one that hath put
his hope in man,”2551 and without any doubt those are under this curse whom also the
sacred Psalm notifies, “who trust in their own strength;”2552 nor by the old covenant which
gendereth to bondage,2553 although it was divinely given by the grace of a sure dispensation;
nor by that law itself, holy and just and good as it was, where it is written, “Thou shalt not
covet,”2554 since it was not given as being able to give life, but it was added for the sake of
transgression until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; but I say that
they were freed by the blood of the Redeemer Himself, who is the one Mediator of God and
man, the man Christ Jesus.2555 But those enemies of the grace of God, which is given to
small and great through Jesus Christ our Lord, say that the men of God of old were of a

<head>Chapter 13 <del>VIII.</del>—The Fifth Calumny,—That It is Said that Paul and the Rest of
the Apostles Were Polluted by Lust.</head>
<p>He says, “They say that even the Apostle Paul, even all the apostles, were always polluted
by immoderate lust.” What man, however profane he may be, would dare to say this? But
doubtless this man thus misrepresents because they contend that what the apostle said, “I
know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing, for to will is present with me,
but how to perform that which is good I find not,”2556 and other such things, he said not
of himself, but that he introduced the person of somebody else, I know not who, who was
suffering these things. Wherefore that passage in his epistle must be carefully considered
and investigated, that their error may not lurk in any obscurity of his. Although, therefore,
the apostle is here arguing broadly, and with great and lasting conflict maintaining grace
against those who were boasting in the law, yet we do come upon a few matters which pertain
to the matter in hand. On which subject he says: “Because by the law there shall no flesh be
justified in His sight. For by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of
God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the
righteousness of God by the faith of Jesus Christ unto all them that believe. For there is no
difference. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by
His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”2557 And again: “Where is boasting?
It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No; but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude
that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.”2558 And again: “For the
promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through
the law, but by the righteousness of faith. For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is
made void, and the promise made of none effect. Because the law worketh wrath, for where
no law is, there is no transgression.”2559 And in another place: “Moreover, the law entered
that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded grace did much more abound.”2560
In still another place: “For sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under law,
but under grace.”2561 And again in another place: “Know ye not, brethren (for I speak to
them that know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man so long as he liveth? For
the woman which is under a husband is joined to her husband by the law so long as he liveth;
but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband.”2562 And a little after:

“Therefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that ye
should belong to another, who has risen from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto
God. For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins which are by the law did work in
our members to bring forth fruit unto death, but now we are delivered from the law of death
in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of
the letter.”2563 With these and such like testimonies that teacher of the Gentiles showed
with sufficient evidence that the law could not take away sin, but rather increased it, and
that grace takes it away; since the law knew how to command, to which command weakness
gives way, while grace knows to assist, whereby love is infused.2564 And lest any one, on
account of these testimonies, should reproach the law, and contend that it is evil, the apostle,
seeing what might occur to those who ill understand it, himself proposed to himself the
same question. “What shall we say, then?” said he. “Is the law sin? Far from it. But I did not
know sin except by the law.”2565 He had already said before, “For by the law is the knowledge
of sin.” It is not, therefore, the taking away, but the knowledge of sin.</p>

<pb n="1061"/>
<head>Chapter 14.—That the Apostle is Speaking in His Own Person and that of Others
Who Are Under Grace, Not Still Under Law.</head>
<p>And from this point he now begins—and, it was on account of this that I undertook the
consideration of these things—to introduce his own person, and to speak as if about himself;
where the Pelagians will not have it that the apostle himself is to be understood, but say that
he has transfigured another person into himself,—that is, a man placed still under the law,
not yet freed by grace. And here, indeed, they ought at least to concede that “in the law no
one is justified,” as the same apostle says elsewhere; but that the law avails for the knowledge
of sin, and for the transgression of the law itself, so that sin, being known and increased,
grace may be sought for through faith. But they do not fear that those things should be understood
concerning the apostle which he might also say concerning his past, but they fear
those things which follow. For here he says: “I had not known lust if the law had not said,
Thou shall not covet. But the occasion being taken, sin wrought in me by the commandment
all manner of lust. For without the law sin was dead. But I was alive without the law once,
but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died, and the commandment which
was for life was found for me to be death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment,
deceived me, and by it slew me. Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment
holy, just, and good. Was, then, that which is good made death unto me? By no means. But
sin, that it might appear sin, worked death to me by that which is good, that the sinner or
the sin might become by the commandment excessive.” All these things, as I have said, the
apostle can seem to have commemorated from his past life: so that from what he says, “For
I was alive without the law once,” he may have wished his first age from infancy to be understood,
before the years of reason; but in that he added, “But when the commandment came,
sin revived, but I died,” he would fain show himself able to receive the commandment, but
not to do it, and therefore a transgressor of the law.</p>

<pb n="1062"/>
<head>Chapter 15 <del>IX.</del>—He Sins in Will Who is Only Deterred from Sinning by Fear.</head>
<p>Nor let us be disturbed by what he wrote to the Philippians: “Touching the righteousness
which is in the law, one who is without blame.” For he could be within in evil affections a
transgressor of the law, and yet fulfil the open works of the law, either by the fear of men or
of God Himself; but by terror of punishment, not by love and delight in righteousness. For
it is one thing to do good with the will of doing good, and another thing to be so inclined
by the will to do evil, that one would actually do it if it could be allowed without punishment.
For thus assuredly he is sinning within in his will itself, who abstains from sin not by will
but by fear. And knowing himself to have been such in these his internal affections, before
the grace of God which is through Jesus Christ our Lord, the apostle elsewhere confesses
this very plainly. For writing to the Ephesians, he says: “And you, though ye were dead in
your trespasses and sins, wherein sometime ye walked according to the course of this world,
according to the prince of the power of the air, of that spirit that now worketh in the children
of disobedience, in whom also we all at one time had our conversation in the lusts of our
flesh, doing the will of our flesh and our affections, and were by nature the children of wrath,
even as others also: but God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved
us even when we were dead in sins, quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we
are saved.” Again to Titus he says: “For we ourselves also were sometime foolish and unbelieving,
erring, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and
holding one another in hatred.” Such was Saul when he says that he was, touching the
righteousness which is in the law, without reproach. For that he had not pressed on in the
law, and changed his character so as to be without reproach after this hateful life, he plainly
shows in what follows, when he says that he was not changed from these evils except by the
grace of the Saviour. For adding also this very thing, here as well as to the Ephesians, he
says: “But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour shone forth, not by works of
righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing
of regeneration, and of the renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom He shed on us most abundantly,
through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified by His grace we should be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.”</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<pb n="1063"/>
<head>Chapter 16.—How Sin Died, and How It Revived.</head>
<p>And what he says in that passage of the Epistle to the Romans, “Sin, that it might appear
sin, wrought death to me by that which is good,”2566 agrees with the former passages where
he said, “But I had not known sin but by the law, for I had not known lust unless the law
had said, Thou shalt not covet.”2567 And previously, “By the law is the knowledge of sin,”
for he said this also here, “that it might appear sin;” that we might not understand what he
had said, “For without law sin was dead,” except in the sense as if it were not, “it lies hidden,
it does not appear, it is completely ignored, as if it were buried in I know not what darkness
of ignorance.” And in that he says, “And I was alive once without the law,” what does he
say except, I seemed to myself to live? And with respect to what he added, “But when the
commandment came, sin revived,” what else is it but sin shone forth, became apparent?
Nor yet does he say lived, but revived. For it had lived formerly in Paradise, where it sufficiently
appeared, admitted in opposition to the command given; but when it is inherited by
children coming into the world, it lies concealed, as if it were dead, until its evil, resisting
righteousness, is felt by its prohibition, when one thing is commanded and approved, another
thing delights and rules: then, in some measure sin revives in the knowledge of the man that
is born, although it had lived already for some time in the knowledge of the man as at first
made.</p>

<head>Chapter 17 <del>X.</del>—“The Law is Spiritual, But I Am Carnal,” To Be Understood of
Paul.</head>
<p>But it is not so clear how what follows can be understood concerning Paul. “For we
know,” says he, “that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal.”2568 He does not say, “I was,” but,
“I am.” Was, then, the apostle, when he wrote this, carnal? or does he say this with respect
to his body? For he was still in the body of this death, not yet made what he speaks of elsewhere:
“It is sown a natural body, it shall be raised a spiritual body.”2569 For then, of the
whole of himself, that is, of both parts of which he consists, he shall be a spiritual man, when
even the body shall be spiritual. For it is not absurd that in that life even the flesh should be
spiritual, if in this life in those who still mind earthly things even the spirit itself may be
carnal. Thus, then, he said, “But I am carnal,” because the apostle had not yet a spiritual
body, as he might say, “But I am mortal,” which assuredly he could not be understood to
have said except in respect of his body, which had not yet been clothed with immortality.
Moreover, in reference to what he added, “sold under sin,”2570 lest any one think that he
was not yet redeemed by the blood of Christ, this also may be understood in respect of that
which he says: “And we ourselves, having the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves
groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.”2571
For if in this respect he says that he was sold under sin, that as yet his body has not been
redeemed from corruption; or that he was sold once in the first transgression of the commandment
so as to have a corruptible body which drags down the soul;2572 what hinders
the apostle here from being understood to say about himself that which he says in such wise
that it may be understood also of himself, even if in his person he wishes not himself alone,
but all, to be received who had known themselves as struggling, without consent, in spiritual
delight with the affection of the flesh?</p>

<p>Or by chance do we fear what follows, “For that which I do I know not, for what I will
I do not, but what I hate that I do,”2573 lest perhaps from these words some one should
suspect that the apostle is consenting to the evil works of the concupiscence of the flesh?
But we must consider what he adds: “But if I do that which I will not, I consent to the law
that it is good.” For he says that he rather consents to the law than to the concupiscence of
the flesh. For this he calls by the name of sin. Therefore he said that he acted and laboured
not with the desire of consenting and fulfilling, but from the impulse of lusting itself. Hence,
then, he says, “I consent to the law that it is good.” I consent because I do not will what it
does not will. Afterwards he says, “Now, then, it is no more I that do it, but sin which
dwelleth in me.”2574 What does he mean by “now then,” but, now at length, under the grace
which has delivered the delight of my will from the consent of lust? For, “it is not I that do
it,” cannot be better understood than that he does not consent to set forth his members as
instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. For if he lusts and consents and acts, how can he
be said not to do the thing himself, even although he may grieve that he does it, and deeply
groan at being overcome?</p>

<p>And now does not what follows most plainly show whence he spoke? “For I know that
in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing”?2575 For if he had not explained what
he said by the addition of “that is, in my flesh,” it might, perchance, be otherwise understood,
when he said, “in me.” And therefore he repeats and urges the same thing in another form:
“For to will is present with me, but to perform that which is good is not.”2576 For this is to
perform that which is good, that a man should not even lust. For the good is incomplete
when one lusts, even although a man does not consent to the evil of lust. “For the good that
I would,” says he, “I do not; but the evil that I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would
not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.”2577 This he repeated impressively,
and as it were to stir up the most slothful from slumber: “I find then that the law,” said he,
“is for me wishing to do good, since evil is present with me.”2578 The law, then, is for one
who would do good, but evil is present from lust, though he does not consent to this who
says, “It is no longer I that do it.”</p>

<p>And he declares both more plainly in what follows: “For I delight in the law of God after
the inward man; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,
and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.”2579 But in that
he said, “bringing me into captivity,” he can feel emotion without consenting to it. Whence,
because of those three things, two, to wit, of which we have already argued, in that he says,
“But I am carnal,” and “Sold under sin,” and this third, “Bringing me into captivity in the
law of sin, which is in my members,” the apostle seems to be describing a man who is still
living under the law, and is not yet under grace. But as I have expounded the former two
sayings in respect of the still corruptible flesh, so also this latter may be understood as if he
had said, “bringing me into captivity,” in the flesh, not in the mind; in emotion, not in
consent; and therefore “bringing me into captivity,” because even in the flesh there is not
an alien nature, but our own. As, therefore, he himself expounded what he had said, “For I
know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing,” so also now out of the exposition
of that we ought to learn the meaning of this passage, as if he had said, “Bringing me
into captivity,” that is, “my flesh,” “to the law of sin, which is in my members.”</p>

shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our
Lord!” And thence he concludes: “Therefore I myself with the mind serve the law of God,
but with the flesh the law of sin.”2580 To wit, with the flesh, the law of sin, by lusting; but
with the mind, the law of God, by not consenting to that lust. “For there is now no condemnation
to those who are in Christ Jesus.”2581 For he is not condemned who does not consent
to the evil of the lust of the flesh. “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
thee free from the law of sin and death,” so that, to wit, the lust of the flesh may not appropriate
to itself thy consent. And what follows more and more demonstrates the same
meaning. But moderation must be used.</p>

<p>And it had once appeared to me also that the apostle was in this argument of his describing
a man under the law.2582 But afterwards I was constrained to give up the idea by those
words where he says, “Now, then, it is no more I that do it.” For to this belongs what he says
subsequently also: “There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus.” And because I do not see how a man under the law should say, “I delight in the law
of God after the inward man;” since this very delight in good, by which, moreover, he does
not consent to evil, not from fear of penalty, but from love of righteousness (for this is meant

<head>Chapter 23 <del>XI.</del>—What It is to Be Delivered from the Body of This Death.</head>
<p>For when he says also, “Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”2583 who
can deny that when the apostle said this he was still in the body of this death? And certainly
the wicked are not delivered from this, to whom the same bodies are returned for eternal
torment. Therefore, to be delivered from the body of this death is to be healed of all the
weakness of fleshly lust, and to receive the body, not for penalty, but for glory. With this
passage also those words are sufficiently in harmony: “Ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the
redemption, of our body.” For surely we groan with that groaning wherein we say, “O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” That also where
he says, “For what I do, I know not;” what else is it than: “I will not, I do not approve, I do
not consent, I do not do”? Otherwise it is contrary to what he said above, “By the law is the
knowledge of sin,” and, “I had not known sin but by the law,” and, “Sin, that it might appear
sin, worked death in me by that which is good.” For how did he know sin, of which he was
ignorant, by the law? How does sin which is not known appear? Therefore it is said, “I know
not,” for “I do not,” because I myself commit it with no consent of mine; in the same way
in which the Lord will say to the wicked, “I know you not,”2584 although, beyond a doubt,
nothing can be hid from Him; and as it is said, “Him who had not known sin,”2585 which
means who had not done sin, for He had not known what He condemned.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—He Concludes that the Apostle Spoke in His Own Person, and that of
Those Who are Under Grace.</head>
<p>On the careful consideration of these things, and things of the same kind in the context
of that apostolical Scripture, the apostle is rightly understood to have signified not, indeed,
himself alone in his own person, but others also established under grace, and with him not
yet established in that perfect peace in which death shall be swallowed up in victory.2586
And concerning this he afterwards says, “But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because
of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. If, then, the Spirit of Him that raised
up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also
quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.”2587 Therefore, after our
mortal bodies have been quickened, not only will there be no consent to sinning, but even
the lust of the flesh itself, to which there is no consent, will not remain. And not to have this
resistance to the spirit in the mortal flesh, was possible only to that man who came not by
the flesh to men. And that the apostles, because they were men, and carried about in the
mortality of this life a body which is corrupted and weighs down the soul, 2588 were, therefore,
“always polluted with excessive lust,” as that man injuriously affirms, be it far from me to
say. But I do say that although they were free from consent to depraved lusts, they nevertheless
groaned concerning the concupiscence of the flesh, which they bridled by restraint with
such humility and piety, that they desired rather not to have it than to subdue it.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—In What Sense Lust is Called Sin in the Regenerate.</head>
<p>But concerning that concupiscence of the flesh of which they speak, I believe that they
are deceived, or that they deceive; for with this even he that is baptized must struggle with
a pious mind, however carefully he presses forward, and is led by the Spirit of God. But although
this is called sin, it is certainly so called not because it is sin, but because it is made
by sin, as a writing is said to be some one’s “hand” because the hand has written it. But they
are sins which are unlawfully done, spoken, thought, according to the lust of the flesh, or
to ignorance—things which, once done, keep their doers guilty if they are not forgiven. And
this very concupiscence of the flesh is in such wise put away in baptism, that although it is
inherited by all that are born, it in no respect hurts those that are born anew. And yet from
these, if they carnally beget children, it is again derived; and again it will be hurtful to those
that are born, unless by the same form it is remitted to them as born again, and remains in
them in no way hindering the future life, because its guilt, derived by generation, has been
put away by regeneration; and thus it is now no more sin, but is called so, whether because
it became what it is by sin, or because it is stirred by the delight of sinning, although by the
conquest of the delight of righteousness consent is not given to it. Nor is it on account of
this, the guilt of which has already been taken away in the laver of regeneration, that the
baptized say in their prayer, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors;”2590 but
on account of sins which are committed, whether in consentings to it, when what is right
is overcome by that which pleases, or when by ignorance evil is accepted as if it were good.
And they are committed, whether by acting, or by speaking, or—and this is the easiest and
the quickest—by thinking. From all which things what believer ever will boast that he has
his heart pure? or who will boast that he is pure from sin?2591 Certainly that which follows
in the prayer is said on account of concupiscence: “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil.” “For every one,” as it is written, “is tempted when he is drawn away of his
own concupiscence, and enticed; then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth
forth sin.”2592</p>

<head>Chapter 28 <del>XIV.</del>—Many Without Crime, None Without Sin.</head>
<p>All these products of concupiscence, and the old guilt of concupiscence itself, are put
away by the washing of baptism. And whatever that concupiscence now brings forth, if they
are not those products which are called not only sins, but even crimes, are purified by that
method of daily prayer when we say, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive,” and by the sincerity
of alms-giving. For no one is so foolish as to say that that precept of our Lord does
not refer to baptized people: “Forgive and it shall be forgiven you, give and it shall be given
you.”2593 But none could rightly be ordained a minister in the Church if the apostle had
said, “If any is without sin,” where he says, “If any is without crime;”2594 or if he had said,
“Having no sin,” where he says, “Having no crime.”2595 Because many baptized believers
are without crime, but I should say that no one in this life is without sin,—however much
the Pelagians are inflated, and burst asunder in madness against me because I say this: not
because there remains anything of sin which is not remitted in baptism; but because by us
who remain in the weakness of this life such sins do not cease daily to be committed, as are
daily remitted to those who pray in faith and work in mercy. This is the soundness of the
catholic faith, which the Holy Spirit everywhere sows,—not the vanity and presumption of
spirit of heretical pravity.</p>

and, to make use of his word, virility, without which there can be no intercourse, was so
appointed by God that there was in it nothing to be ashamed of. For it was not fit that His
creature should blush at the work of his Creator; but by a just punishment the disobedience
of the members was the retribution to the disobedience of the first man, for which disobedience
they blushed when they covered with fig-leaves those shameful parts which previously

<head>Chapter 32 <del>XVI.</del>—The Aprons Which Adam and Eve Wore.</head>
<p>For they did not use for themselves tunics to cover their whole bodies after their sin,
but aprons,2596 which some of the less careful of our translators have translated as “coverings.”
And this indeed is true; but “covering” is a general name, by which may be understood
every kind of clothing and veil. And ambiguity ought to be avoided, so that, as the Greek
called them περιζώματα, by which only the shameful parts of the body are covered, so also
the Latin should either use the Greek word itself, because now custom has come to use it
instead of the Latin, or, as some do, use the word aprons,2597 or, as others have better named
them, wrestling aprons.2598 Because this name is taken from that ancient Roman custom
whereby the youth covered their shameful parts when they were exercised naked in the field;
whence even at this day they are called campestrati,2599 since they cover those members
with the girdle. Although, if those members by which sin was committed were to be covered
after the sin, men ought not indeed to have been clothed in tunics, but to have covered their
hand and mouth, because they sinned by taking and eating. What, then, is the meaning,
when the prohibited food was taken, and the transgression of the precept had been committed,
of the look turned towards those members? What unknown novelty is felt there, and
compels itself to be noticed? And this is signified by the opening of the eyes. For their eyes
were not closed, either when Adam gave names to the cattle and birds, or when Eve saw the
trees to be beautiful and good; but they were made open—that is, attentive—to consider; as
it is written of Agar, the handmaid of Sarah, that she opened her eyes and saw a well,2600
although she certainly had not had them closed before. As, therefore, they were so suddenly
ashamed of their nakedness, which they were daily in the habit of looking upon and were
not confused, that they could now no longer bear those members naked, but immediately
took care to cover them; did not they—he in the open, she in the hidden impulse—perceive
those members to be disobedient to the choice of their will, which certainly they ought to
have ruled like the rest by their voluntary command? And this they deservedly suffered,
because they themselves also were not obedient to their Lord. Therefore they blushed that
they in such wise had not manifested service to their Creator, that they should deserve to
lose dominion over those members by which children were to be procreated.</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—The Shame of Nakedness.</head>
<p>This kind of shame—this necessity of blushing—is certainly born with every man, and
in some measure is commanded by the very laws of nature; so that, in this matter, even
virtuous married people are ashamed. Nor can any one go to such an extreme of evil and
disgrace, as, because he knows God to be the author of nature and the ordainer of marriage,
to have intercourse even with his wife in any one’s sight, or not to blush at those impulses
and seek secrecy, where he can shun the sight not only of strangers, but even of all his own
relatives. Therefore let human nature be permitted to acknowledge the evil that happens to
it by its own fault, lest it should be compelled either not to blush at its own impulses, which
is most shameless, or else to blush at the work of its Creator, which is most ungrateful. Of
this evil, nevertheless, virtuous marriage makes good use for the sake of the benefit of the
begetting of children. But to consent to lust for the sake of carnal pleasure alone is sin, although
it may be conceded to married people with permission.</p>

<head>Chapter 34 <del>XVII.</del>—Whether There Could Be Sensual Appetite in Paradise Before
the Fall.</head>
<p>But, while maintaining, ye Pelagians, the honourableness and fruitfulness of marriage,
determine, if nobody had sinned, what you would wish to consider the life of those people
in Paradise, and choose one of these four things. For beyond a doubt, either as often as ever
they pleased they would have had intercourse; or they would bridle lust when intercourse
was not necessary; or lust would arise at the summons of will, just at the time when chaste
prudence would have perceived beforehand that intercourse was necessary; or, with no lust
existing at all, as every other member served for its own work, so for its own work the organs
of generation also would obey the commands of those that willed, without any difficulty.
Of these four suppositions, choose which you please; but I think you will reject the two
former, in which lust is either obeyed or resisted. For the first one would not be in accordance
with so great a virtue, and the second not in harmony with so great a happiness. For be the
idea far from us, that the glory of so great a blessedness as that should either be most basely
enslaved by always following a preceding lust, or, by resisting it, should not enjoy the most
abounding peace. Away, I say, with the thought that that mind should either be gratified by
consenting to satisfy the concupiscence of the flesh, arising not opportunely for the sake of
procreation, but with unregulated excitement, or that that quiet should find it necessary to
restrain it by refusing.</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—Desire in Paradise Was Either None at All, or It Was Obedient to the
Impulse of the Will.</head>
<p>But whichever you choose of the two other alternatives, there is no necessity for striving
against you with any disputation. For even if you should refuse to elect the fourth, in which
there is the highest tranquillity of all the obedient members without any lust, since already
the urgency of your arguments has made you hostile to it; that will doubtless please you
which I have put in the third place, that that carnal concupiscence, whose impulse attains
to the final pleasure which much delights you, should never arise in Paradise except at the
bidding of the will when it would be necessary for procreation. If it is agreeable to you to
arrange this in Paradise, and if, by means of such a concupiscence of the flesh which should
neither anticipate, nor impede, nor exceed the bidding of the will, it appears to you that
children could have been begotten, I have no objection. For, as far as I am concerned in this
matter, it is enough for me that such a concupiscence of the flesh is not now among men,
as you concede there might have been in that place of happiness. For what it now is, the
sense of all men certainly confesses, although with modesty; because it both solicits with
excessive and importunate uneasiness the chaste, even when they are unwilling and are
checking it by moderation, and frequently withdraws itself from the willing and inflicts itself
on the unwilling; so that, by its disobedience, it testifies that it is nothing else than the punishment
of that first disobedience. Whence, reasonably, both then the first men when they
covered their nakedness, and now whoever considers himself to be a man, every no less
modest than immodest person is confounded at it—far be it from us to say by the work of
God, but—by the penalty of the first and ancient sin. You, however, not for the sake of religious
reasoning, but for excited contention,—not on behalf of human modesty, but for your
own madness, that even the concupiscence of the flesh itself should not be thought to be
currupted, and original sin to be derived from it,—are endeavouring by your argument to
recall it absolutely, such as it now is, into Paradise; and to contend that that concupiscence
could have been there which would either always be followed by a disgraceful consent, or
would sometimes be restrained by a pitiable refusal. I, however, do not greatly care what it
delights you to think of it. Still, whatever of men is born by its means, if he is not born again,
without doubt he is damned; and he must be under the dominion of the devil, if he is not
delivered thence by Christ.</p>

own will; but that in a good work he is always assisted by God’s grace, while in evil he is incited

are the work of God; but in so far as they are sinners, they are under the devil, unless they
are plucked from thence by Him who became the Mediator between God and man, for no
other reason than because He could not be a sinner from men. And that no one is forced
by God’s power unwillingly either into evil or good, but that when God forsakes a man, he
deservedly goes to evil, and that when God assists, without deserving he is converted to
good. For a man is not good if he is unwilling, but by the grace of God he is even assisted
to the point of being willing; because it is not vainly written, “For it is God that worketh in

<p>But you think that a man is so aided by the grace of God in a good work, that in stirring
up his will to that very good work you believe that grace does nothing; for this your own
words sufficiently declare. For why have you not said that a man is incited by God’s grace
to a good work, as you have said that he is incited to evil by the suggestions of the devil, but
have said that in a good work he is always aided by God’s grace?—as if by his own will, and
without any grace of God, he undertook a good work, and were then divinely assisted in
the work itself, for the sake, that is to say, of the merits of his good will; so that grace is
rendered as due,—not given as not due,—and thus grace is made no more grace.2603 But
this is what, in the Palestinian judgment, Pelagius with a deceitful heart condemned,—that
the grace of God, namely, is given according to our merits. Tell me, I beseech you, what
good, Paul, while he was as yet Saul, willed, and not rather great evils, when breathing out
slaughter he went, in horrible darkness of mind and madness, to lay waste the Christians?2604
For what merits of a good will did God convert him by a marvellous and sudden calling
from those evils to good things? What shall I say, when he himself cries, “Not by works of
righteousness that we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us”?2605 What is
that which I have already mentioned2606 as having been said by the Lord, “No one can come
to me,”—which is understood as “believe on me,”—unless it were given him of my Father”?
2607 Whether is this given to him who is already willing to believe, for the sake of the
merits of a good will? or rather is the will itself, as in the case of Saul, stirred up from above,
that he may believe, even although he is so averse from the faith as even to persecute the
believers? For how has the Lord commanded us to pray for those who persecute us? Do we
pray thus that the grace of God may be recompensed them for the sake of their good will,
and not rather that the evil will itself may be changed into a good one? Just as we believe
that at that time the saints whom he was persecuting did not pray for Saul in vain, that his
will might be converted to the faith which he was destroying. And indeed that his conversion
was effected from above, appeared even by a manifest miracle. But how many enemies of
Christ are at the present day suddenly drawn by God’s secret grace to Christ! And if I had
not set down this word from the gospel, what things would that man have said in this behalf
concerning me, since even now he is stirring, not against me, but against Him who cries,
“No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him”!2608 For He does

not say, “except He lead him,” so that we can thus in any way understand that his will precedes.
For who is “drawn,” if he was already willing? And yet no man comes unless he is
willing. Therefore he is drawn in wondrous ways to will, by Him who knows how to work
within the very hearts of men. Not that men who are unwilling should believe, which cannot

<head>Chapter 38 <del>XX.</del>—The Power of God’s Grace is Proved.</head>
<p>That this is true we do not surmise by human conjecture, but we discern by the most
evident authority of the divine Scriptures. It is read in the books of the Chronicles: “Also in
Judah, the hand of God was made to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the
king and of the princes in the word of the Lord.”2609 Also by Ezekiel the prophet the Lord
says, “I will give them another heart, and a new spirit will I give them; and I will take away
their stony heart out of their flesh, and I will give them an heart of flesh, that they may walk
in my commandments and observe my judgments and do them.”2610 And what is that which
Esther the queen prays when she says, “Give me eloquent speech in my mouth, and enlighten
my words in the sight of the lion, and turn his heart to hatred of him that fighteth against
us”?2611 How does she say such things as these in her prayer to God, if God does not work
His will in men’s hearts? But perchance the woman was foolish in praying thus. Let us see,
then, whether the desire of the petitioner was vainly sent on in advance, and whether the
result did not follow as of one who heard. Lo, she goes in to the king. We need not say much.
And because she did not approach him in her own order, under the compulsion of her great
necessity, “he looked upon her,” as it is written, “like a bull in the impulse of his indignation.
And the queen feared, and her colour was changed through faintness, and she bowed herself
upon the head of her maid, who went before her. And God changed him, and converted his
indignation into mildness.”2612 Now what need is there to relate what follows, where the
divine Scripture testifies that God fulfilled what she had asked for by working in the heart
of the king nothing other than the will by which he commanded, and it was done as the
queen had asked of him? And now God had heard her that it should be done, who changed
the heart of the king by a most secret and efficacious power before he had heard the address
of the woman beseeching him, and moulded it from indignation to mildness,—that is, from
the will to hurt, to the will to favour,—according to that word of the apostle, “God worketh
in you to will also.” Did the men of God who wrote these things—nay, did the Spirit of God
Himself, under whose guidance such things were written by them—assail the free will of
man? Away with the notion! But He has commended both the most righteous judgment
and the most merciful aid of the Omnipotent in all cases. For it is enough for man to know
that there is no unrighteousness with God. But how He dispenses those benefits, making

<head>Chapter 39 <del>XXI.</del>—Julian’s Fifth Objection Concerning the Saints of the Old Testament.</head>
<p>“We say,” says he, “that the saints of the Old Testament, their righteousness being perfected
here, passed to eternal life,—that is, that by the love of virtue they departed from all
sins; because those whom we read of as having committed any sin, we nevertheless know
to have amended themselves.” Of whatever virtue you may declare that the ancient righteous
men were possessed, nothing saved them but the belief in the Mediator who shed His blood
for the remission of their sins. For their own word is, “I believed, and therefore I spoke.”2614
Whence the Apostle Paul also says, “And we having the same Spirit of faith, according as it
is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.”2615
What is “the same Spirit,” but that Spirit whom these righteous men also had who said such
things? The Apostle Peter also says, “Why do ye wish to put a yoke upon the heathen, which
neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? But, by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
we believe that we shall be saved, even as they.”2616 You who are enemies to this grace do
not wish this, that the ancients should be believed to have been saved by the same grace of
Jesus Christ; but you distribute the times according to Pelagius,2617 in whose books this is
read, and you say that before the law men were saved by nature, then by the law, lastly by
Christ, as if to men of the two former times, that is to say, before the law and under the law,
the blood of Christ had not been necessary; making void what is said: “For there is one God
and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”2618</p>

All, and Concerning the Baptism of Infants.</head>
<p>They say, “We confess that the grace of Christ is necessary to all, both to grown-up
people and to infants; and we anathematize those who say that a child born of two baptized
people ought not to be baptized.” I know in what sense you say such things as these—not
according to the Apostle Paul, but according to the heretic Pelagius;—to wit, that baptism
is necessary for infants, not for the sake of the remission of sins, but only for the sake of the
kingdom of heaven; for you give them outside the kingdom of heaven a place of salvation
and life eternal, even if they have not been baptized. Nor do you regard what is written,
“Whosoever believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he who believeth not shall be
condemned.”2619 For which reason, in the Church of the Saviour, infants believe by means
of other people, even as they have derived those sins which are remitted them in baptism
from other people. Nor do you think thus, that they cannot have life who have been without
the body and blood of Christ, although He said Himself, “Unless ye eat my flesh and drink
my blood, ye shall have no life in you.”2620 Or if you are forced by the words of the gospel
to confess that infants departing from the body cannot have either life or salvation unless
they have been baptized, ask why those who are not baptized are compelled to undergo the
judgment of the second death, by the judgment of Him who condemns nobody undeservingly,
and you will find what you do not want,—original sin!</p>

which they declare concerning us, and a full agreement shall be made; but if they will not,
know ye that they are Manicheans, and abstain from their company;”—this is rather to be
despised than rebuked. For which of us hesitates to pronounce an anathema against the
Manicheans, who say that from the good God neither proceed men, nor was ordained
marriage, nor was given the law, which was ministered to the Hebrew people by Moses! But
against the Pelagians also, not without reason, we pronounce an anathema, for that they are
so hostile to God’s grace, which comes through Jesus Christ our Lord, as to say that it is
given not freely, but according to our merits, and thus grace is no more grace;2621 and place
so much in free will by which man is plunged into the abyss, as to say that by making good
use of it man deserves grace,—although no man can make good use of it except by grace,
which is not repaid according to debt, but is given freely by God’s mercy. And they so contend
that infants are already saved, that they dare deny that they are to be saved by the Saviour.
And holding and disseminating these execrable dogmas, they still over and above constantly
demand a hearing, when, as condemned, they ought to repent.</p>

<p>He undertakes to examine the second letter of the Pelagians, filled, like the first, with calumnies

incurred by the Roman clergy in the latter condemnation of Pelagius and Coelestius
by Zosimus, showing that the Pelagian dogmas were never approved at Rome, although
for some time, by the clemency of Zosimus, Coelestius was mercifully dealt with, with a
view to leading him to the correction of his errors. He shows that, under the name of grace,
Catholics neither assert a doctrine of fate, nor attribute respect of persons to God; although
they truly say that God’s grace is not given according to human merits, and that the first
desire of good is inspired by God; so that a man does not at all make a beginning of a
change from bad to good, unless the unbought and gratuitous mercy of God effects that
beginning in him.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Introduction; The Pelagians Impeach Catholics as Manicheans.</head>
<p>Let me now consider a second letter, not of Julian’s alone, but common to him with
several bishops, which they sent to Thessalonica; and let me answer it, with God’s help, as
I best can. And lest this work of mine become longer than the necessity of the subject itself
requires, what need is there to refute those things which do not contain the insidious poison
of their doctrine, but seem only to plead for the acquiescence of the Eastern bishops for
their assistance, or, on behalf of the catholic faith, against the profanity, as they say, of the
Manicheans; with no other view except, a horrible heresy being presented to them, whose
adversaries they profess themselves to be, to lie hid as the enemies of grace in praise of
nature? For who at any time has stirred any question of these matters against them? or what
catholic is displeased because they condemn those whom the apostle foretold as departing
from the faith, having their conscience seared, forbidding to marry, abstaining from meats
that they think unclean, not thinking that all things were created by God?2622 Who at any
time constrained them to deny that every creature of God is good, and there is no substance
which the supreme God has not made, except God Himself, who was not made by any? It
is not such things as these, which it is plain are catholic truths, that are rebuked and condemned
in them; because not alone the catholic faith holds in detestation the Manichean
impiety as exceedingly foolish and mischievous, but also all heretics who are not Manicheans.
Whence even these Pelagians do well to utter an anathema against the Manicheans, and to
speak against their errors. But they do two evil things, for which they themselves must also
be anathematized—one, that they impeach catholics under the name of Manicheans, the
other, that they themselves also are introducing the heresy of a new error. For they are not
therefore sound in the faith because they are not labouring under the disease of the
Manicheans. The kind of pestilence is not always one and the same—as in the bodies, so
also in the minds. As, therefore, the physician of the body would not have pronounced a
man free from peril of death whom he might have declared free from dropsy, if he had seen
him to be sick of some other mortal disease; so truth is not acknowledged in their case because
they are not Manicheans, if they are raving in some other kind of perversity. Wherefore
what we anathematize with them is one thing, what we anathematize in them is another.
For we hold in abhorrence with them what is rightly offensive to them also; just as, never-
theless, we hold in abhorrence in them that for which they themselves are rightly offensive.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—The Heresies of the Manicheans and Pelagians are Mutually Opposed,
and are Alike Reprobated by the Catholic Church.</head>
<p>The Manicheans say that the good God is not the Creator of all natures; the Pelagians
that God is not the Purifier, the Saviour, the Deliverer of all ages among men. The catholic
Church condemns both; as well maintaining God’s creation against the Manicheans, that
no nature may be denied to be framed by Him, as maintaining against the Pelagians that in
all ages human nature must be sought after as ruined. The Manicheans rebuke the concupiscence
of the flesh, not as if it were an accidental vice, but as if it were a nature bad from
eternity; the Pelagians approve it as if it were no vice, but even a natural good. The catholic
faith condemns both, saying to the Manicheans, “It is not nature, but it is vice;” saying to
the Pelagians, “It is not of the Father, but it is of the world;” in order that both may allow it
as an evil sickness to be cured—the former by ceasing to believe it, as it were, incurable, the
latter by ceasing to proclaim it as laudable. The Manicheans deny that to a good man the
beginning of evil came from free will; the Pelagians say that even a bad man has free will
sufficiently to perform the good commandment. The catholic Church condemns both,
saying to the former, “God made man upright,”2623 and saying to the latter, “If the Son shall
make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”2624 The Manicheans say that the soul, as a particle
of God, has sin by the commixture of an evil nature; the Pelagians say that the soul is upright,
not indeed a particle, but a creature of God, and has not even in this corruptible life any sin.
The catholic Church condemns both, saying to the Manicheans, “Either make the tree good
and its fruit good, or make the tree evil and its fruit evil,”2625 which would not be said to
man who cannot make his own nature, unless because sin is not nature, but vice; and saying
to the Pelagians, “If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.”2626 In these diseases, opposed as they are to one another, the Manicheans and the
Pelagians are at issue, with dissimilar will but with similar vanity, separated by different
opinions, but close together by a perverse mind.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—How Far the Manicheans and Pelagians are Joined in Error; How Far
They are Separated.</head>
<p>Still, indeed, they alike oppose the grace of Christ, they alike make His baptism of no
account, they alike dishonour His flesh; but, moreover, they do these things in different
ways and for different reasons. For the Manicheans assert that divine assistance is given to
the merits of a good nature, but the Pelagians, to the merits of a good will. The former say,
God owes this to the labours of His members; the latter say, God owes this to the virtues of
His servants. In both cases, therefore, the reward is not imputed according to grace, but
according to debt. The Manicheans contend, with a profane heart, that the washing of regeneration—
that is, the water itself—is superfluous, and is of no advantage. But the Pelagians
assert that what is said in holy baptism for the putting away of sins is of no avail to infants,
as they have no sin; and thus in the baptism of infants, as far as pertains to the remission of
sins, the Manicheans destroy the visible element, but the Pelagians destroy even the invisible
sacrament. The Manicheans dishonour Christ’s flesh by blaspheming the birth from the
Virgin; but the Pelagians by making the flesh of those to be redeemed equal to the flesh of
the Redeemer. Since Christ was born, not of course in sinful flesh, but in the likeness of
sinful flesh, while the flesh of the rest of mankind is born sinful. The Manicheans, therefore,
who absolutely abominate all flesh, take away the manifest truth from the flesh of Christ;
but the Pelagians, who maintain that no flesh is born sinful, take away from Christ’s flesh
its special and proper dignity.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—The Two Contrary Errors.</head>
<p>Let the Pelagians, then, cease to object to the catholics that which they are not, but let
them rather hasten to amend what they themselves are; and let them not wish to be considered
deserving of approval because they are opposed to the hateful error of the
Manicheans, but let them acknowledge themselves to be deservedly hateful because they do
not put away their own error. For two errors may be opposed to one another, although both
are to be reprobated because both are alike opposed to the truth. For if the Pelagians are to
be loved because they hate the Manicheans, the Manicheans should also be loved because
they hate the Pelagians. But be it far from our catholic mother to choose some to love on
the ground that they hate others, when by the warning and help of the Lord she ought to
avoid both, and should desire to heal both.</p>

<head>Chapter 5 <del>III.</del>—The Calumny of the Pelagians Against the Clergy of the Roman
Church.</head>
<p>Moreover, they accuse the Roman clergy, writing, “That, driven by the fear of a com-
mand, they have not blushed to be guilty of the crime of prevarication; so that, contrary to
their previous judgment, wherein by their proceedings they had assented to the catholic
dogma, they subsequently pronounced that the nature of men is evil.” Nay, but the Pelagians
had conceived, with a false hope, that the new and execrable dogma of Pelagius or Coelestius
could be made acceptable to the catholic intelligences of certain Romans, when those crafty
spirits—however perverted by a wicked error, yet not contemptible, since they appeared
rather to be deserving of considerate correction than of easy condemnation—were treated
with somewhat more of lenity than the stricter discipline of the Church required. For while
so many and such important ecclesiastical documents were passing and repassing between
the Apostolical See and the African bishops, 2627—and, moreover, when the proceedings
in this matter in that see were completed, with Coelestius present and making answer,—what
sort of a letter, what decree, is found of Pope Zosimus, of venerable memory, wherein he
prescribed that it must be believed that man is born without any taint of original sin? Absolutely
he never said this—never wrote it at all. But since Coelestius had written this in his
pamphlet, among those matters, merely, on which he confessed that he was still in doubt
and desired to be instructed, the desire of amendment in a man of so acute an intellect, who,
if he could be put right, would assuredly be of advantage to many, and not the falsehood of
the doctrine, was approved. And therefore his pamphlet was called catholic, because this
also is the part of a catholic disposition,—if by chance in any matters a man thinks differently
from what the truth demands, not with the greatest accuracy to define those matters, but,
if detected and demonstrated, to reject them. For it was not to heretics, but to catholics, that
the apostle was speaking when he said, “Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus
minded; and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.”2628
This was thought to have been the case in him when he replied that he consented to the
letters of Pope Innocent of blessed memory, in which all doubt about this matter was removed.
And in order that this might be made fuller and more manifest in him, matters were
delayed until letters should come from Africa, in which province his craftiness had in some
sort become more evidently known. And afterwards these letters came to Rome containing
this, that it was not sufficient for men of more sluggish and anxious minds that he confessed
his general consent to the letters of Bishop Innocent, but that he ought openly to anathematize
the mischievous statements which he had made in his pamphlet; lest if he did not do
so, many people of better intelligence should rather believe that in his pamphlet those

<pb n="1098"/>
poisons of the faith had been approved by the catholic see, because it had been affirmed by
that see that that pamphlet was catholic, than that they had been amended because of his
answer that he consented to the letters of Pope Innocent. Then, therefore, when his presence
was demanded, in order that by certain and clear answers either the craft of the man or his
correction might plainly appear and remain doubtful to no one, he withdrew himself and
refused the examination. Neither would the delay which had already been made for the advantage
of others have taken place, if it could not be of advantage to the pertinacity and
madness of those who were excessively perverse. But if, which be far from the case, it had
so been judged in the Roman Church concerning Coelestius or Pelagius, that those dogmas
of theirs, which in themselves and with themselves Pope Innocent had condemned, should
be pronounced worthy of approval and maintenance, the mark of prevarication would rather
have to be branded on the Roman clergy for this. But now, when the first letters of the most
blessed Pope Innocent, in reply to the letters of the African bishops, 2629 would have equally
condemned this error which these men are endeavouring to commend to us; and his successor,
the holy Pope Zosimus, would never have said, never have written, that this dogma
which these men think concerning infants is to be held; nay, would even have bound
Coelestius by a repeated sentence, when he endeavoured to clear himself, to a consent to the
above-mentioned letters of the Apostolic See;—assuredly, whatever in the meanwhile was
done more leniently concerning Coelestius, provided the stability of the most ancient and
robust faith were maintained, was the most merciful persuasion of correction, not the most
pernicious approval of wickedness; and that afterwards, by the same priesthood, Coelestius
and Pelagius were condemned by repeated authority, was the proof of a severity, for a little
while intermitted, at length of necessity to be carried out, not a denial of a previously-known
truth or a new acknowledgment of truth.</p>

<p>But what need is there for us to delay longer in speaking of this matter, when there are
extant here and there proceedings and writings drawn up, where all those things just as they
were transacted may be either learnt or recalled? For who does not see in what degree
Coelestius was bound by the interrogations of your holy predecessor and by the answers of
Coelestius, whereby he professed that he consented to the letters of Pope Innocent, and
fastened by a most wholesome chain, so as not to dare any further to maintain that the original
sin of infants is not put away in baptism? Because these are the words of the venerable
Bishop Innocent concerning this matter to the Carthaginian Council: “For once,” he said,
“he bore free will; but, using his advantage inconsiderately, and falling into the depths of
apostasy, he was overwhelmed, and found no way whereby he could rise from thence; and,
deceived for ever by his liberty, he would have lain under the oppression of this ruin, if the
advent of Christ had not subsequently for his grace delivered him, and, by the purification
of a new regeneration, purged all past sin by the washing of His baptism.”2630 What could
be more clear or more manifest than that judgment of the Apostolical See? To this Coelestius
professed that he assented, when it was said to him by your holy predecessor, “Do you
condemn all those things that are bandied about under your name?” and he himself replied,
“I condemn them in accordance with the judgment of your predecessor Innocent, of blessed
memory.” But among other things which had been uttered under his name, the deacon
Paulinus had objected to Coelestius that he said “that the sin of Adam was prejudicial to
himself alone, and not to the human race, and that infants newly born were in the same
condition in which Adam was before his sin.”2631 Accordingly, if he would condemn the
views objected to by Paulinus with a truthful heart and tongue, according to the judgment
of the blessed Pope Innocent, what could remain to him afterwards whence he could contend
that there was no sin in infants resulting from the past transgression of the first man, which
would be purged in holy baptism by the purification of the new regeneration? But he showed
that he had answered deceitfully by the final event, when he withdrew himself from the examination,
lest he should be compelled, according to the African rescripts, absolutely to
mention and anathematize the very words themselves concerning this question which he
wrote in his tractate.</p>

<p>What was that which the same pope replied to the bishops of Numidia concerning this
very cause, because he had received letters from both Councils, as well from the Council of
Carthage as from the Council of Mileve—does he not speak most plainly concerning infants?
For these are his words:2632 “For what your Fraternity2633 asserts that they preach, that infants
can be endowed with the rewards of eternal life even without the grace of baptism, is
excessively silly; for unless they shall eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood,
they shall not have life in themselves.2634 And they who maintain this as being theirs without
regeneration, appear to me to wish to destroy baptism itself, since they proclaim that these
have that which we believe is not to be conferred on them without baptism.” What does the
ungrateful man say to this, when the Apostolic See had already spared him on his profession,
as if he were corrected by its most benignant lenity? What does he say to this? Will infants
after the end of their life, even if while they live they are not baptized in Christ, be in eternal
life, or will they not? If he should say, “They will,” how then did he answer that he had
condemned what had been uttered under his name “according to the judgment of Innocent,
of blessed memory”? Lo, Pope Innocent, of blessed memory, says that infants have not life
without Christ’s baptism, and without partaking of Christ’s body and blood. If he should
say, “They will not,” how then, if they do not receive eternal life, are they certainly by consequence
condemned in eternal death if they derive no original sin?</p>

<p>What do they say to these things who dare also to write their mischievous impieties,
and dare to send them to the Eastern bishops? Coelestius is held to have given consent to
the letters of the venerable Innocent; the letters themselves of the prelate mentioned are
read, and he writes that infants who are not baptized cannot have life. And who will deny
that, as a consequence, they have death, if they have not life? Whence, then, in infants, is so
wretched a penalty as that, if there is no original fault? How, then, are the Roman clergy
charged with prevarication by those forsakers of the faith and opponents of grace under
Bishop Zosimus, as if they had had any other view in the subsequent condemnation of
Coelestius and Pelagius than that which they had in a former one under Innocent? Because,
certainly, since by the letters of the venerable Innocent concerning the abode of infants in
eternal death unless they were baptized in Christ, the antiquity of the catholic faith shone
forth, assuredly he would rather be a prevaricator from the Roman Church who should
deviate from that judgment; and since with God’s blessing this did not happen, but that
judgment itself was constantly maintained in the repeated condemnation of Coelestius and
Pelagius, let them understand that they themselves are in the position wherein they accuse
others of being, and let them hereafter be healed of their prevarication from the faith. Because
the catholic faith does not say that the nature of man is bad in as far as he was made man
at first by the Creator; nor now is what God creates in that nature when He makes men from
men, his evil; but what he derives from that sin of the first man.</p>

<p>And now we must look to those things which they objected to us in their letters, and
briefly mentioned. And to these this is my answer. We do not say that by the sin of Adam
free will perished out of the nature of men; but that it avails for sinning in men subjected
to the devil; while it is not of avail for good and pious living, unless the will itself of man
should be made free by God’s grace, and assisted to every good movement of action, of
speech, of thought. We say that no one but the Lord God is the maker of those who are born,
and that marriage was ordained not by the devil, but by God Himself; yet that all are born
under sin on account of the fault of propagation, and that, therefore, all are under the devil
until they are born again in Christ. Nor are we maintaining fate under the name of grace,
because we say that the grace of God is preceded by no merits of man. If, however, it is
agreeable to any to call the will of the Almighty God by the name of fate, while we indeed
shun profane novelties of words, we have no use for contending about words.</p>

it well to object this to us, that we assert fate under the name of grace, I first of all looked
into those words of theirs which follow. For thus they have thought that this was to be objected
to us: “Under the name,” say they, “of grace, they so assert fate as to say that unless
God inspired unwilling and resisting man with the desire of good, and that good imperfect,
he would neither be able to decline from evil nor to lay hold of good.” Then a little after,
where they mention what they maintain, I gave heed to what was said by them about this
matter. “We confess,” say they, that baptism is necessary for all ages, and that grace, moreover,
assists the good purpose of everybody; but yet that it does not infuse the love of virtue into
a reluctant one, because there is no acceptance of persons with God.”2635 From these words
of theirs, I perceived that for this reason they either think, or wish it to be thought, that we
assert fate under the name of grace, because we say that God’s grace is not given in respect
of our merits, but according to His own most merciful will, in that He said, “I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.”2636 Where,
by way of consequence, it is added, “Therefore it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.”2637 Here any one might be equally foolish in
thinking or saying that the apostle is an assertor of fate. But here these people sufficiently
lay themselves open; for when they malign us by saying that we maintain fate under the
name of grace, because we say that God’s grace is not given on account of our merits, beyond
a doubt they confess that they themselves say that it is given on account of our merits; thus
their blindness could not conceal and dissimulate that they believe and think thus, although,
when this view was objected to him, Pelagius, in the episcopal judgment of Palestine, with
crafty fear condemned it. For it was objected to him from the words of his own disciple
Coelestius, indeed, that he himself also was in the habit of saying that God’s grace is given
on account of our merits. And he in abhorrence, or in pretended abhorrence, of this, did
not delay, with his lips at least, to anathematize it;2638 but, as his later writings indicate, and
the assertion of those followers of his makes evident, he kept it in his deceitful heart, until
afterwards his boldness might put forth in letters2639 what the cunning of a denier had then
hidden for fear. And still the Pelagian bishops do not dread, and at least are not ashamed,
to send their letters to the catholic Eastern bishops, in which they charge us with being as-

<head>Chapter 11 <del>VI.</del>—The Accusation of Fate is Thrown Back Upon the Adversaries.</head>
<p>But is it true, O children of pride, enemies of God’s grace, new Pelagian heretics, that
whoever says that all man’s good deservings are preceded by God’s grace, and that God’s
grace is not given to merits, lest it should not be grace if it is not given freely but be repaid
as due to those who deserve it, seems to you to assert fate? Do not you yourselves also say,
whatever be your purpose, that baptism is necessary for all ages? Have you not written in
this very letter of yours that opinion concerning baptism, and that concerning grace, side
by side? Why did not baptism, which is given to infants, by that very juxtaposition admonish
you what you ought to think concerning grace? For these are your words: “We confess that
baptism is necessary for all ages, and that grace, moreover, assists the good purpose of
everybody; but yet that it does not infuse the love of virtue into a reluctant one, because
there is no acceptance of persons with God.” In all these words of yours, I for the meanwhile
say nothing of what you have said concerning grace. But give a reason concerning baptism,
why you should say that it is necessary for all ages; say why it is necessary for infants. Assuredly
because it confers some good upon them; and that same something is neither small
nor moderate, but of great account. For although you deny that they contract the original
sin which is remitted in baptism, yet you do not deny that in that laver of regeneration they
are adopted from the sons of men unto the sons of God; nay, you even preach this. Tell us,
then, how the infants, whoever they are, that are baptized in Christ and have departed from
the body, received so lofty a gift as this, and with what preceding merits. If you should say
that they have deserved this by the piety of their parents, it will be replied to you, Why is
this benefit sometimes denied to the children of pious people and given to the children of
the wicked? For sometimes the offspring born from religious people, in tender age, and thus
fresh from the womb, is forestalled by death before it can be washed in the laver of regeneration,
and the infant born of Christ’s foes is baptized in Christ by the mercy of Christians,—
the baptized mother bewails her own little one not baptized, and the chaste virgin
gathers in to be baptized a foreign offspring, exposed by an unchaste mother. Here, certainly,
the merits of parents are wanting, and even by your own confession the merits of the infants
themselves are wanting also. For we know that you do not believe this of the human soul,
that it has lived somewhere before it inhabited this earthly body, and has done something
either of good or of evil for which it might deserve such difference in the flesh. What cause,
then, has procured baptism for this infant, and has denied it to that? Do they have fate because
they do not have merit? or is there in these things acceptance of persons with God? For you
have said both,—first fate, afterwards acceptance of persons,—that, since both must be refuted,
there may remain the merit which you wish to introduce against grace. Answer, then,
concerning the merits of infants, why some should depart from their bodies baptized, others
not baptized, and by the merits of their parents neither possess nor fail of so excellent a gift
that they should become sons of God from sons of men, by no deserving of their parents,

<pb n="1106"/>
by no deservings of their own. You are silent, forsooth, and you find yourselves rather in
the same position which you object to us. For if when there is no merit you say that consequently
there is fate, and on this account wish the merit of man to be understood in the
grace of God, lest you should be compelled to confess fate; see, you rather assert a fate in
the baptism of infants, since you avow that in them there is no merit. But if, in the case of
infants to be baptized, you deny that any merit at all precedes, and yet do not concede that
there is a fate, why do you cry out,—when we say that the grace of God is therefore given
freely, lest it should not be grace, and is not repaid as if it were due to preceding merits,—that
we are assertors of fate?—not perceiving that in the justification of the wicked, as there are
no merits because it is God’s grace, so that it is not fate because it is God’s grace, and so that
it is not acceptance of persons because it is God’s grace.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—What is Meant Under the Name of Fate.</head>
<p>Because they who affirm fate contend that not only actions and events, but, moreover,
our very wills themselves depend on the position of the stars at the time in which one is
conceived or born; which positions they call “constellations.” But the grace of God stands
above not only all stars and all heavens, but, moreover, all angels. In a word, the assertors
of fate attribute both men’s good and evil doings and fortunes to fate; but God in the ill
fortunes of men follows up their merits with due retribution, while good fortunes He bestows
by undeserved grace with a merciful will; doing both the one and the other not according
to a temporal conjunction of stars, but according to the eternal and high counsel of His
severity and goodness. We see, then, that neither belongs to fate. Here, if you answer that
this very benevolence of God, by which He follows not merits, but bestows undeserved benefits
with gratuitous bounty, should rather be called “fate,” when the apostle calls this
“grace,” saying, “By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, but it is the
gift of God; not of works, lest perchance any one should be lifted up,”2640—do you not
consider, do you not perceive that it is not by us that fate is asserted under the name of
grace, but it is rather by you that divine grace is called by the name of fate?</p>

<head>Chapter 13 <del>VII.</del>—He Repels the Calumny Concerning the Acceptance of Persons.</head>
<p>And, moreover, we rightly call it “acceptance of persons” where he who judges, neglecting
the merit of the cause concerning which he is judging, favours the one against the other,
because he finds something in his person which is worthy of honour or of pity. But if any
one have two debtors, and he choose to remit the debt to the one, to require it of the other,
he gives to whom he will and defrauds nobody; nor is this to be called “acceptance of persons,”
since there is no injustice. The acceptance of persons may seem otherwise to those
who are of small understanding, where the lord of the vineyard gave to those labourers who
had done work therein for one hour as much as to those who had borne the burden and
heat of the day, making them equal in wages in the labour of whom there had been such a
difference. But what did he reply to those who murmured against the goodman of the house
concerning this, as it were, acceptance of persons? “Friend,” said he, “I do thee no wrong.
Hast not thou agreed with me for a denarius? Take what thine is, and go; but I choose to
give to this last as to thee. Is it not lawful to me to do what I will? Is thine eye evil because I
am good?”2641 Here, forsooth, is the entire justice: “I choose this. To thee,” he says, “I have
repaid; on him I have bestowed; nor have I taken anything away from thee to bestow it on
him; nor have I either diminished or denied what I owed to you.” “May I not do what I will?
Is thine eye evil because I am good?” As, therefore, here there is no acceptance of persons,
because one is honoured freely in such wise as that another is not defrauded of what is due
to him: so also when, according to the purpose of God, one is called, another is not called,
a gratuitous benefit is bestowed on the one that is called, of which benefit the calling itself
is the beginning,—an evil is repaid to him that is not called, because all are guilty, from the
fact that by one man sin entered into the world. And in that parable of the labourers, indeed,
where they received one denarius who laboured for one hour, as well as those who laboured
twelve times as long,—though assuredly these latter, according to human reasonings, however
vain, ought in proportion to the amount of their labour to have received twelve denarii,—both
were put on an equality in respect of benefit, not some delivered and others condemned;
because even those who laboured more had it from the goodman of the house himself, both
that they were so called as to come, and that they were so fed as to have no want. But where
it is said, “Therefore, on whom He will He has mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth,”
2642 who “maketh one vessel to honour and another to dishonour”2643 it is given indeed
without deserving, and freely, because he is of the same mass to whom it is not given; but
evil is deservedly and of debt repaid, since in the mass of perdition evil is not repaid to the
evil unjustly. And to him to whom it is repaid it is evil, because it is his punishment; while

<pb n="1109"/>
to Him by whom it is repaid it is good, because it is His right to do it. Nor is there any acceptance
of persons in the case of two debtors equally guilty, if to the one is remitted and
from the other is claimed that which is equally owed by both.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—He Illustrates His Argument by an Example.</head>
<p>But that what I am saying may be made clear by the exhibition of an example, let us
suppose certain twins, born of a certain harlot, and exposed that they might be taken up by
others. One of them has expired without baptism; the other is baptized. What can we say
was in this case the “fate” or the “fortune,” which are here absolutely nothing? What “acceptance
of persons,” when with God there is none, even if there could be any such thing in
these cases, seeing that they certainly had nothing for which the one could be preferred to
the other, and no merits of their own,—whether good, for which the one might deserve to
be baptized; or evil, for which the other might deserve to die without baptism? Were there
any merits in their parents, when the father was a fornicator, the mother a harlot? But of
whatever kind those merits were, there were certainly not any that were different in those
who died in such different conditions, but all were common to both. If, then, neither fate,
since no stars made them to differ; nor fortune, since no fortuitous accidents produce these
things; nor the diversity of persons nor of merits have done this; what remains, so far as it
refers to the baptized child, save the grace of God, which is given freely to vessels made unto
honour; but, as it refers to the unbaptized child, the wrath of God, which is repaid to the
vessels made for dishonour in respect of the deservings of the lump itself? But in that one
which is baptized we constrain you to confess the grace of God, and convince you that no
merit of its own preceded; but as to that one which died without baptism, why that sacrament
should have been wanting to it, which even you confess to be needful for all ages, and what
in that manner may have been punished in him, it is for you to see who will not have it that
there is any original sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—The Apostle Meets the Question by Leaving It Unsolved.</head>
<p>Since in the case of those two twins we have without a doubt one and the same case, the
difficulty of the question why the one died in one way, and the other in another, is solved
by the apostle as it were by not solving it; for, when he had proposed something of the same
kind about two twins, seeing that it was said (not of works, since they had not as yet done
anything either of good or of evil, but of Him that calleth), “The older shall serve the
younger,” 2644 and, “Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated;”2645 and he had prolonged
the horror of this deep thing even to the point of saying, “Therefore hath He mercy on whom
He will, and whom He will He hardeneth:”2646 he perceived at once what the trouble was,
and opposed to himself the words of a gainsayer which he was to check by apostolical authority.
For he says, “You say, then, unto me, “Why doth He yet find fault? For who has
resisted His will?” And to him who says this he answered, “O man, who art thou that repliest
against God? Doth the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me
thus? Hath not the potter power of the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour
and another unto dishonour?”2647 Then, following on, he opened up this great and hidden
secret as far as he judged it fit that it should be disclosed to men, saying, “But if God, willing
to show His wrath and to demonstrate His power, endured in much patience the vessels of
wrath fitted for destruction, even that He might make known the riches of His glory on the
vessels of mercy which He has prepared for glory.”2648 This is not only the assistance, but,
moreover, the proof of God’s grace—the assistance, namely, in the vessels of mercy, but the
proof in the vessels of wrath; for in these He shows His anger and makes known His power,
because His goodness is so mighty that He even uses the evil well; and in those He makes
known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, because what the justice of a punisher
requires from the vessels of wrath, the grace of the Deliverer remits to the vessels of mercy.
Nor would the kindness which is bestowed on some freely appear, unless to other equally
guilty and from the same mass God showed what was really due to both, and condemned
them with a righteous judgment. “For who maketh thee to differ?”2649 says the same apostle
to a man as it were boasting concerning himself and his own benefits. “For who maketh
thee to differ” from the vessels of wrath; of course, from the mass of perdition which has
sent all by one into damnation? “Who maketh thee to differ?” And as if he had answered,
“My faith maketh me to differ,—my purpose, my merit,”—he says, “For what hast thou

<pb n="1112"/>
which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast as if thou
receivedst it not?”—that is, as if that by which thou art made to differ were of thine own.
Therefore He maketh thee to differ who bestows that whence thou art made to differ, by
removing the penalty that is due, by conferring the grace which is not due. He maketh to
differ, who, when the darkness was upon the face of the abyss, said, “Let there be light; and
there was light, and divided”—that is, made to differ—“between the light and the darkness.”
2650 For when there was only darkness, He did not find what He should make to differ;
but by making the light, He made to differ; so that it may be said to the justified wicked,
“For ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.”2651 And thus he who
glories must glory not in himself, but in the Lord. He makes to differ who—of those who
are not yet born, and who have not yet done any good or evil, that His purpose, according
to the election, might stand not of works, but of Himself that calleth—said, The older shall
serve the younger, and commending that very purpose afterwards by the mouth of the
prophet, said, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”2652 Because he said “the election,”
and in this God does not find made by another what He may choose, but Himself makes
what He may find; just as it is written of the remnant of Israel: “There is made a remnant
by the election of grace; but if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no
more grace.”2653 On which account you are certainly foolish who, when the Truth declares,
“Not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said,” say that Jacob was loved on account of
future works which God foreknew that he would do, and thus contradict the apostle when
he says, “Not of works;” as if he could not have said, “Not of present, but of future works.”
But he says, “Not of works,” that He might commend grace; “but if of grace, now is it no
more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.” For grace, not due, but free, precedes,
that by it good works may be done; but if good works should precede, grace should be repaid,
as it were, to works, and thus grace should be no more grace.</p>

One After, and the Other Without, the Grace of Baptism.</head>
<p>But that every lurking-place of your darkness may be taken away from you, I have proposed
to you the case of such twins as were not assisted by the merits of their parents, and
both died in the very beginning of infancy, the one baptized, the other without baptism; lest
you should say that God foreknew their future works, as you say of Jacob and Esau, in opposition
to the apostle. For how did He foreknow that those things should be, which, in
those infants who were to die in infancy, He rather foreknew as not to be, since His foreknowledge
cannot be deceived? Or what does it profit those who are taken away from this
life that wickedness may not change their understanding, nor deceit beguile their soul, if
even the sin which has not been done, said, or thought, is thus punished as if it had been
committed? Because, if it is most absurd, silly, and senseless, that certain men should have
to be condemned for those sins, the guilt of which they could neither derive from their
parents, as you say, nor could incur themselves, either by committing them, or even by
conceiving of them, there comes back to you that unbaptized twin brother of the baptized
one, and silently asks you for what reason he was made to differ from his brother in respect
of happiness,—why he was punished with that infelicity, so that, while his brother was adopted
into a child of God, he himself should not receive that sacrament which, as you confess,
is necessary for every age, if, even as there is not a fortune or a fate, or an acceptance of
persons with God, so there is no gift of grace without merits, and no original sin. To this
dumb child you absolutely submit your tongue and voice; to this witness who says nothing,—

<head>Chapter 17 <del>VIII.</del>—Even the Desire of an Imperfect Good is a Gift of Grace, Otherwise
Grace Would Be Given According to Merits.</head>
<p>Let us now see, as we can, the nature of this thing which they will have to precede in
man, in order that he may be regarded as worthy of the assistance of grace, and to the merit
of which in him grace is not given as if unearned, but is rendered as due; and thus grace is
no more grace. Let us see, however, what this is. “Under the name,” say they, “of grace, they
so assert fate as to say that unless God should have inspired the desire for good, and that,
imperfect good, into unwilling and resisting man, he would neither be able to decline from
evil nor to grasp after good.” I have already shown what empty things they speak about fate
and grace. Now the question which I ought to consider is this, whether God inspires the
desire of good into unwilling and resisting man, that he may be no longer unwilling, no
longer resisting, but consenting to the good and willing the good. For those men will have
it that the desire of good in man begins from man himself; that the merit of this beginning
is, moreover, attended with the grace of completion—if, at least, they will allow so much as
even this. For Pelagius says that what is good is “more easily” fulfilled if grace assists.2654
By which addition—that is, by adding “more easily”—he certainly signifies that he is of the
opinion that, even if the aid of grace should be wanting, yet good might be accomplished,
although with greater difficulty, by free will. But let me prescribe to my present opponents
what they should think in this matter, without speaking of the author of this heresy himself.
Let us allow them, with their free will, to be free even from Pelagius himself, and rather give
heed to their words which they have written in this letter to which I am replying.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—The Desire of Good is God’s Gift.</head>
<p>For they have thought that it was to be objected to us that we say “that God inspires
into unwilling and resisting man the desire,” not of any very great good, but “even of imperfect
good.” Possibly, then, they themselves are keeping open, in some sense at least, a place
for grace, as thinking that man may have the desire of good without grace, but only of imperfect
good; while of perfect, he could not easily have the desire with grace, but except with
it they could not have it at all. Truly, even in this way, too, they are saying that God’s grace
is given according to our merits, which Pelagius, in the ecclesiastical meeting in the East,
condemned, in the fear of being condemned. For if without God’s grace the desire of good
begins with ourselves, merit itself will have begun—to which, as if of debt, comes the assistance
of grace; and thus God’s grace will not be bestowed freely, but will be given according
to our merit. But that he might furnish a reply to the future Pelagius, the Lord does not say,
“Without me it is with difficulty that you can do anything,” but He says, “Without me ye
can do nothing.”2655 And, that He might also furnish an answer to these future heretics, in
that very same evangelical saying He does not say, “Without me you can perfect nothing,”
but “do” nothing. For if He had said “perfect,” they might say that God’s aid is necessary
not for beginning good, which is of ourselves, but for perfecting it. But let them hear also
the apostle. For when the Lord says, “Without me ye can do nothing,” in this one word He
comprehends both the beginning and the ending. The apostle, indeed, as if he were an ex-
pounder of the Lord’s saying, distinguished both very clearly when he says, “Because He
who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it even to the day of Christ Jesus.”2656 But
in the Holy Scriptures, in the writings of the same apostle, we find more about that of which
we are speaking. For we are now speaking of the desire of good, and if they will have this to
begin of ourselves and to be perfected by God, let them see what they can answer to the
apostle when he says, “Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our
sufficiency is of God.”2657 “To think anything,” he says,—he certainly means, “to think
anything good;” but is it less to think than to desire. Because we think all that we desire, but
we do not desire all that we think; because sometimes also we think what we do not desire.
Since, then, it is a smaller thing to think than to desire,—for a man may think good which
he does not yet desire, and by advancing may afterwards desire what before without desire
he thought of,—how are we not sufficient as of ourselves to that which is less, that is, to the
thinking of something good, but our sufficiency is of God; while to that which is greater,—that
is, to the desire of some good thing—without the divine help, we are sufficient of free will?
For what the apostle says here is not, “Not that we are sufficient as of ourselves to think that
<note type="footnote">2655 John xv. 5.</note>

this is the meaning of what the Lord says, “Without me ye can do nothing.”</p>

<p>But assuredly, as to what is written, “The preparation of the heart is man’s part, and the
answer of the tongue is from the Lord,”2658 they are misled by an imperfect understanding,
so as to think that to prepare the heart—that is, to begin good—pertains to man without
the aid of God’s grace. Be it far from the children of promise thus to understand it! As if,
when they heard the Lord saying, “Without me ye can do nothing,”2659 they would convict
Him by saying, “Behold without Thee we can prepare the heart;” or when they heard from
Paul the apostle, “Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency
is of God,”2660 as if they would also convict him, saying, “Behold, we are sufficient
of ourselves to prepare our heart, and thus also to think some good thing; for who can
without good thought prepare his heart for good?” Be it far from any thus to understand
the passage, except the proud maintainers of free will and forsakers of the catholic faith!
Therefore, since it is written, “It is man’s part to prepare the heart, and the answer of the
tongue is from the Lord,” it is that man prepares his heart, not, however, without the aid of
God, who so touches the heart that man prepares the heart. But in the answer of the
tongue—that is, in that which the divine tongue answers to the prepared heart—man has
no part; but the whole is from the Lord God.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—God’s Agency is Needful Even in Man’s Doings.</head>
<p>For as it is said, “It is man’s part to prepare his heart, and the answer of the tongue is
from the Lord;” so also is it said, “Open thy mouth, and I will fill it.”2661 For although, save
by His assistance without whom we can do nothing, we cannot open our mouth, yet we
open it by His aid and by our own agency, while the Lord fills it without our agency. For
what is to prepare the heart and to open the mouth, but to prepare the will? And yet in the
same scriptures is read, “The will is prepared by the Lord,”2662 and, “Thou shalt open my
lips, and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise.”2663 So God admonishes us to prepare our
will in what we read,” It is man’s part to prepare his heart;” and yet, that man may do this,
God helps him, because the will is prepared by the Lord. And,” Open thy mouth.” This He
so says by way of command, as that nobody can do this unless it is done by His aid, to whom
it is said, “Thou shalt open my lips.” Are any of these men so foolish as to contend that the
mouth is one thing, the lips another; and to say with marvellous triviality that man opens
his own mouth, and God opens man’s lips? And yet God restrains them from even that absurdity
where He says to Moses His servant, “I will open thy mouth, and I will instruct thee
what thou oughtest to speak.”2664 In that clause, therefore, where He says, “Open thy mouth
and I will fill it,” it seems, as it were, that one of them pertains to man, the other to God.
But in this, where it is said, “I will open thy mouth and will instruct thee,” both belong to
God. Why is this, except that in one of these cases He co-operates with man as the agent,
in the other He does it alone?</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Man Does No Good Thing Which God Does Not Cause Him to Do.</head>
<p>Wherefore God does many good things in man which man does not do; but man does
none which God does not cause man to do. Accordingly, there would be no desire of good
in man from the Lord if it were not a good; but if it is a good, we have it not save from Him
who is supremely and incommunicably good. For what is the desire for good but love, of
which John the apostle speaks without any ambiguity, and says, “Love is of God”? 2665 Nor
is its beginning of ourselves, and its perfection of God; but if love is of God, we have the
whole of it from God. May God by all means turn away this folly of making ourselves first
in His gifts, Himself last,—because “His mercy shall prevent me.”2666 And it is He to whom
is faithfully and truthfully sung, “For Thou hast prevented him with the blessings of sweetness.”
2667 And what is here more fitly understood than that very desire of good of which
we are speaking? For good begins then to be longed for when it has begun to grow sweet.
But when good is done by the fear of penalty, not by the love of righteousness, good is not
yet well done. Nor is that done in the heart which seems to be done in the act when a man
would rather not do it if he could evade it with impunity. Therefore the “blessing of sweetness”
is God’s grace, by which is caused in us that what He prescribes to us delights us, and
we desire it,—that is, we love it; in which if God does not precede us, not only is it not perfected,
but it is not even begun, from us. For, if without Him we are able to do nothing actually,
we are able neither to begin nor to perfect,—because to begin, it is said “His mercy
shall prevent me;”2668 to finish, it is said, “His mercy shall follow me.”2669</p>

<head>Chapter 22 <del>X.</del>—According to Whose Purpose the Elect are Called.</head>
<p>Why, then, is it that, in what follows, where they mention what they themselves think,
they say they confess “That grace also assists the good purpose of every one, but that yet it
does not infuse the desire of virtue into a reluctant heart”? Because they so say this as if man
of himself, without God’s assistance, has a good purpose and a desire of virtue; and this
precedent merit is worthy of being assisted by the subsequent grace of God. For they think,
perchance, that the apostle thus said, “For we know that He worketh all things for good to
them that love God, to them who are called according to the purpose,”2670 so as to wish the
purpose of man to be understood, which purpose, as a good merit, the mercy of the God
that calleth might follow; being ignorant that it is said, “Who are called according to the
purpose,” so that there may be understood the purpose of God, not man, whereby those
whom He foreknew and predestinated as conformed to the image of His Son, He elected
before the foundation of the world. For not all the called are called according to purpose,
since “many are called, few are chosen.”2671 They, therefore, are called according to the
purpose, who were elected before the foundation of the world. Of this purpose of God, that
also was said which I have already mentioned concerning the twins Esau and Jacob, “That
according to the election the purpose of God might remain, not of works, but of Him that
calleth; it was said, that the elder shall serve the younger.”2672 This purpose of God is also
mentioned in that place where, writing to Timothy, he says, “Labour with the gospel according
to the power of God, who saves us and calls us with this holy calling; not according to
our works, but according to His purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus
before the eternal ages, but is now made manifest by the coming of our Saviour Jesus
Christ.”2673 This, then, is the purpose of God, whereof it is said, “He worketh together all
things for good for those who are called according to the purpose.” But subsequent grace
indeed assists man’s good purpose, but the purpose would not itself exist if grace did not
precede. The desire of man, also, which is called good, although in beginning to exist it is
aided by grace, yet does not begin without grace, but is inspired by Him of whom the apostle
says, “But thanks be to God, who has given the same desire for you in the heart of Titus.”2674
If God gives desire that every one may have it for others, who else will give it that a man
may have it for himself?</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Nothing is Commanded to Man Which is Not Given by God.</head>
<p>Since these things are so, I see that nothing is commanded to man by the Lord in the
Holy Scriptures, for the sake of trying his free will, which is not found either to begin by
His goodness, or to be asked in order to demonstrate the aid of grace; nor does man at all
begin to be changed by the beginning of faith from evil to good, unless the unbought and
gratuitous mercy of God effects this in him. Of which one recalling his thought, as we read
in the Psalms, says, “Shall God forget to be gracious? or will He restrain His mercies in His
anger? And I said, Now have I begun; this change is of the right hand of the Most High.”2675
When, therefore, he had said, “Now have I begun,” he does not say, “This change is of my
will,” but “of the right hand of the Most High.” So, therefore, let God’s grace be thought of,
that from the beginning of his good changing, even to the end of his completion, he who
glorieth may glory in the Lord; because, as no one can perfect good without the Lord, so no
one can begin it without the Lord. But let this be the end of this book, that the attention of
the reader may be refreshed and strengthened for what follows.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—The Misrepresentation of the Pelagians Concerning the Use of the
Old Law.</head>
<p>They declare “that we say that the law of the Old Testament was given not for the end
that it might justify the obedient, but rather that it might become the cause of greater sin.”
Certainly, they do not understand what we say concerning the law; because we say what the
apostle says, whom they do not understand. For who can say that they are not justified who
are obedient to the law, when, unless they were justified, they could not be obedient? But
we say, that by the law is effected that what God wills to be done is heard, but that by grace
is effected that the law is obeyed. “For not the hearers of the law,” says the apostle, “are just
before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.”2676 Therefore the law makes hearers
of righteousness, grace makes doers. “For what was impossible to the law,” says the same
apostle, “in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful
flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be
fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.”2677 This is
what we say;—let them pray that they may one day understand it, and not dispute so as
never to understand it. For it is impossible that the law should be fulfilled by the flesh, that
is, by carnal presumption, in which the proud, who are ignorant of the righteousness of
God,—that is, which is of God to man, that he may be righteous,—and desirous of establishing
their own righteousness,—as if by their own will, unassisted from above, the law could be
fulfilled,—are not subjected to the righteousness of God.2678 Therefore the righteousness
of the law is fulfilled in them who walk not according to the flesh—that is, according to
man, ignorant of the righteousness of God and desirous of establishing his own—but walk
according to the Spirit. But who walks according to the Spirit, except whosoever is led by
the Spirit of God? “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.”2679
Therefore “the letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh alive.”2680 And the letter is not evil because
it killeth; but it convicts the wicked of transgression. “For the law is holy, and the commandment
holy and just and good. Was, then,” says he, “that which is good made death unto me?
By no means; but sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good,
that it might become above measure a sinner or a sin by the commandment.”2681 This is

what is the meaning of “the letter killeth.” “For the sting of death is sin, but the strength of
sin is the law;”2682 because by the prohibition it increases the desires of sin, and thence slays
a man unless grace by coming to his assistance makes him alive.2683</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Scriptural Confirmation of the Catholic Doctrine.</head>
<p>This is what we say; this is that about which they object to us that we say “that the law
was so given as to be a cause of greater sin.” They do not hear the apostle saying, “For the
law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression;”2684 and, “The law was
added for the sake of transgression until the seed should come to whom the promise was
made;”2685 and, “If there had been a law given which could have given life, righteousness
should altogether have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that
the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.”2686 Hence it is
that the Old Testament, from the Mount Sinai, where the law was given, gendereth to
bondage, which is Agar. “Now we,” says he, “are not children of the bondmaid but of the
freewoman.”2687 Therefore they are not children of the freewoman who have accepted the
law of the letter, whereby they can be shown to be not only sinners, but moreover transgressors;
but they who have received the Spirit of grace, whereby the law itself, holy and just
and good, may be fulfilled. This is what we say: let them attend and not contend; let them
seek enlightenment and not bring false accusations.</p>

<head>Chapter 4 <del>III.</del>—Misrepresentation Concerning the Effect of Baptism.</head>
<p>“They assert,” say they, “that baptism, moreover, does not make men new—that is, does
not give complete remission of sins; but they contend that they are partly made children of
God and partly remain children of the world, that is, of the devil.” They deceive; they lay
traps; they shuffle; we do not say this. For we say that all men who are children of the devil
are also children of the world; but not that all children of the world are also children of the
devil. Far be it from us to say that the holy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and others
of this kind, were children of the devil when they were begetting in marriage, and those
believers who until now and still hereafter continue to beget. And yet we cannot contradict
the Lord when He says, “The children of this world marry and give in marriage.”2688 Some,
therefore, are children of this world, and yet are not children of the devil. For although the
devil is the author and source of all sins, yet it is not every sin that makes children of the
devil; for the children of God also sin, since if they say they have no sins they deceive
themselves, and the truth is not in them.2689 But they sin in virtue of that condition by
which they are still children of this world; but by that grace wherewith they are the children
of God they certainly sin not, because every one that is born of God sinneth not.2690 But
unbelief makes children of the devil; and unbelief is specially called sin, as if it were the only
one, if it is not expressed what is the nature of the sin. As when the “apostle” is spoken of,
if it be not expressed what apostle, none is understood but Paul; because he is better known
by his many epistles, and he laboured more than they all. For which reason, in what the
Lord said of the Holy Spirit, “He shall convict the world of sin,”2691 He meant unbelief to
be understood; for He said this when He was explaining, “Of sin because they believed not
on me,”2692 and when He says, “If I had not come and spoken to them, they should not
have sin.”2693 For He meant not that before they had no sin, but He wished to indicate that
very want of faith by which they did not believe Him even when He was present to them
and speaking to them; since they belonged to him of whom the apostle says, “According to
the prince of the power of the air, who now worketh in the children of unbelief.”2694
Therefore they in whom there is not faith are the children of the devil, because they have
not in the inner man any reason why there should be forgiven them whatever is committed
either by human infirmity, or by ignorance, or by any evil will whatever. But those are the

children of God who certainly, if they should “say that they have no sin, deceive themselves,
and the truth is not in them, but immediately” (as it continues) “when they confess their
sins” (which the children of the devil do not do, or do not do according to the faith which
is peculiar to the children of God), “He is faithful and just to forgive them their sins, and to
cleanse them from all unrighteousness.”2695 And in order that what we say may be more
fully understood, let Jesus Himself be heard, who certainly was speaking to the children of
God when He said: “And if ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.”2696
For if these were not the children of God, He would not say to them, “Your Father which
is in heaven.” And yet He says that they are evil, and that they know how to give good gifts
to their children. Are they, then, evil in that they are the children of God? Away with the
thought! But they are thence evil because they are still the children of this world, although
now made children of God by the pledge of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Baptism Puts Away All Sins, But It Does Not at Once Heal All Infirmities.</head>
<p>Baptism, therefore, washes away indeed all sins—absolutely all sins, whether of deeds
or words or thoughts, whether original or added, whether such as are committed in ignorance
or allowed in knowledge; but it does not take away the weakness which the regenerate man
resists when he fights the good fight, but to which he consents when as man he is overtaken
in any fault; on account of the former, rejoicing with thanksgiving, but on account of the
latter, groaning in the utterance of prayers. On account of the former, saying, “What shall
I render to the Lord for all that He has given me?”2697 On account of the latter, saying,
“Forgive us our debts.”2698 On account of the former, saying, “I will love Thee, O Lord, my
strength.”2699 On account of the latter, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord; for I am
weak.”2700 On account of the former, saying, “Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord; for He
shall pluck my feet out of the net.”2701 On account of the latter, saying, “Mine eye is troubled
with wrath.”2702 And there are innumerable passages with which the divine writings are
filled, which alternately, either in exultation over God’s benefits or in lamentation over our
own evils, are uttered by children of God by faith as long as they are still children of this
world in respect of the weakness of this life; whom, nevertheless, God distinguishes from
the children of the devil, not only by the laver of regeneration, but moreover by the righteousness
of that faith which worketh by love, because the just lives by faith. But this weakness
with which we contend, with alternating failure and progress, even to the death of the body,
and which is of great importance as to what it can overcome in us, shall be consumed by
another regeneration, of which the Lord says, “In the regeneration when the Son of man
shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,”2703 etc. Certainly
in this passage He without doubt calls the last resurrection the regeneration, which Paul the
Apostle also calls both the adoption and the redemption, where he says, “But even we
ourselves, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, ourselves also groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, the redemption, of our body.”2704 Have we not been regenerated,
adopted, and redeemed by the holy washing? And yet there remains a regeneration, an ad-

option, a redemption, which we ought now patiently to be waiting for as to come in the end,
that we may then be in no degree any longer children of this world. Whosoever, then, takes
away from baptism that which we only receive by its means, corrupts the faith; but whosoever
attributes to it now that which we shall receive by its means indeed, but yet hereafter, cuts
off hope. For if any one should ask of me whether we have been saved by baptism, I shall
not be able to deny it, since the apostle says, “He saved us by the washing of regeneration
and renewing of the Holy Ghost.”2705 But if he should ask whether by the same washing
He has already absolutely in every way saved us, I shall answer: It is not so. Because the same
apostle also says, “For we are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a
man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, we with patience
wait for it.”2706 Therefore the salvation of man is effected in baptism, because whatever sin
he has derived from his parents is remitted, or whatever, moreover, he himself has sinned
on his own account before baptism; but his salvation will hereafter be such that he cannot
sin at all.</p>

Men of Old.</head>
<p>Now if these things are so, out of these things are rebutted those which they subsequently
object to us. For what catholic would say that which they charge us with saying, “that the
Holy Spirit was not the assister of virtue in the old testament,” unless when we so understand
“the old testament” in the manner in which the apostle spoke of it as “gendering from Mount
Sinai into bondage”? But because in it was prefigured the new testament, the men of God
who at that time understood this according to the ordering of the times, were indeed the
stewards and bearers of the old testament, but are shown to be the heirs of the new. Shall
we deny that he belongs to the new testament who says, “Create in me a clean heart, O God;
and renew a right spirit within me”?2707 or he who says, “He hath set my feet upon a rock,
and directed my goings; and he hath put a new song in my mouth, even a hymn to our
God”?2708 or that father of the faithful before the old testament which is from Mount Sinai,
of whom the apostle says, “Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; yet even a man’s
testament, when it is confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth thereto. To Abraham and
to his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one;
and to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say,” said he, “that the testament confirmed by
God, the law which was made four hundred and thirty years after, does not weaken, so as
to make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.”2709</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—The New Testament is More Ancient Than the Old; But It Was Subsequently
Revealed.</head>
<p>Here, certainly, if we ask whether this testament, which, he says, being confirmed by
God was not weakened by the law, which was made four hundred and thirty years after, is
to be understood as the new or the old one, who can hesitate to answer “the new, but hidden
in the prophetic shadows until the time should come wherein it should be revealed in Christ”?
For if we should say the old, what will that be which genders from Mount Sinai to bondage?
For there was made the law four hundred and thirty years after, by which law he asserts that
this testament of the promise of Abraham could not be weakened; and he will have this
which was made by Abraham to pertain rather to us, whom he will have to be children of
the freewoman, not of the bondwoman, heirs by the promise, not by the law, when he says,
“For if the inheritance be by the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham
by promise.”2710 So that, because the law was made four hundred and thirty years after, it
might enter that the offence might abound;2711 since by sin the pride of man presuming on
his own righteousness is convinced of transgression, and where sin abounded grace much
more abounded2712 by the faith of the now humble man failing in the law and taking refuge
in God’s mercy. Therefore, when he had said, “For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no
longer of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise,”2713 as if it might be said to
him, “Why then was the law made afterwards? “he added and said, “What then is the
law?”2714 To which interrogation he immediately replied, “It was added because of transgression,
until the seed should come to which the promise was made.”2715 This he says
again, thus: “For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is
made of none effect: because the law worketh wrath: for where there is no law, there is no
transgression.”2716 What he says in the former testimony: “For if the inheritance be of the
law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise,” this he says in the
latter: “For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void; and the promise is made

<head>Chapter 8.—All Righteous Men Before and After Abraham are Children of the
Promise and of Grace.</head>
<p>Whether, then, Abraham, or righteous men before him or after him, even to Moses
himself, by whom was given the testament gendering to bondage from Mount Sinai, or the
rest of the prophets after him, and the holy men of God till John the Baptist, they are all
children of the promise and of grace according to Isaac the son of the freewoman,—not of
the law, but of the promise, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. Far be it from us to
deny that righteous Noah and the righteous men of the earlier times, and whoever from
that time till the time of Abraham could be righteous, either manifestly or hiddenly, belong
to the Jerusalem which is above, who is our mother, although they are found to be earlier
in time than Sarah, who bore the prophecy and figure of the free mother herself. How much
more evidently, then, after Abraham, to whom that promise was declared, that he should
be called the father of many nations, must all, whoever have pleased God, be esteemed the
children of the promise! For from Abraham, and the righteous men who followed him, the
generation is not found more true, but the prophecy more plain.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Who are the Children of the Old Covenant.</head>
<p>But those belong to the old testament, “which gendereth from Mount Sinai to bondage,”
which is Agar, who, when they have received a law which is holy and just and good, think
that the letter can suffice them for life; and do not seek the divine mercy, so as they may
become doers of the law, but, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to
establish their own righteousness, are not subject to the righteousness of God. Of this kind
was that multitude which murmured against God in the wilderness, and made an idol; and
that multitude which even in the very land of promise committed fornication after strange
gods. But this multitude, even in the old testament itself, was strongly rebuked. They,
moreover, whoever they were at that time who followed after those earthly promises alone
which God promises there, and who were ignorant of that which those promises signify
under the new testament, and who kept God’s commandments with the desire of gaining
and with the fear of losing those promises,—certainly did not observe them, but only seemed
to themselves to observe. For there was no faith in them that worked by love, but earthly
cupidity and carnal fear. But he who thus fulfils the commandments beyond a doubt fulfils
them unwillingly, and then does not do them in his heart; for he would rather not do them
at all, if in respect of those things which he desires and fears he might be allowed to neglect
them with impunity. And thus, in the will itself within him, he is guilty; and it is here that
God, who gives the command, looks. Such were the children of the earthly Jerusalem, concerning
which the apostle says, “For she is in bondage with her children,”2717 and belongs
to the old testament “which gendereth to bondage from Mount Sinai, which is Agar.” Of
that same kind were they who crucified the Lord, and continued in the same unbelief. Thence
there are still their children in the great multitude of the Jews, although now the new testament
as it was prophesied is made plain and confirmed by the blood of Christ; and the
gospel is made known from the river where He was baptized and began His teachings, even
to the ends of the earth. And these Jews, according to the prophecies which they read, are
dispersed everywhere over all the earth, that even from their writings may not be wanting
a testimony to Christian truth.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—The Old Law Also Given by God.</head>
<p>And it is for this reason that God made the old testament, because it pleased God to veil
the heavenly promises in earthly promises, as if established in reward, until the fulness of
time; and to give to a people which longed for earthly blessings, and therefore had a hard
heart, a law, which, although spiritual, was yet written on tables of stone. Because, with the
exception of the sacraments of the old books, which were only enjoined for the sake of their
significance (although in them also, since they are to be spiritually understood, the law is
rightly called spiritual), the other matters certainly which pertain to piety and to good living
must not be referred by any interpretation to some significancy,2718 but are to be done absolutely
as they are spoken. Assuredly no one will doubt that that law of God was necessary
not alone for that people at that time, but also is now necessary for us for the right ordering
of our life. For if Christ took away from us that very heavy yoke of many observances, so
that we are not circumcised according to the flesh, we do not immolate victims of the cattle,
we do not rest even from necessary works on the Sabbath, retaining the seventh in the revolution
of the days, and other things of this kind; but keep them as spiritually understood,
and, the symbolizing shadows being removed, are watchful in the light of those things which
are signified by them; shall we therefore say, that when it is written that whoever finds another
man’s property of any kind that has been lost, should return it to him who has lost
it,2719 it does not pertain to us? and many other like things whereby people learn to live piously
and uprightly? and especially the Decalogue itself, which is contained in those two
tables of stone, apart from the carnal observance of the Sabbath, which signifies spiritual
sanctification and rest? For who can say that Christians ought not to be observant to serve
the one God with religious obedience, not to worship an idol, not to take the name of the
Lord in vain, to honour one’s parents, not to commit adulteries, murders, thefts, false witness,
not to covet another man’s wife, or anything at all that belongs to another man? Who is so
impious as to say that he does not keep those precepts of the law because he is a Christian,
and is established not under the law, but under grace?</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Distinction Between the Children of the Old and of the New Testaments.</head>
<p>But there is plainly this great difference, that they who are established under the law,
whom the letter killeth, do these things either with the desire of gaining, or with the fear of
losing earthly happiness; and that thus they do not truly do them, since fleshly desire, by
which sin is rather bartered or increased, is not healed by desire of another kind. These
pertain to the old testament, which genders to bondage; because carnal fear and desire make
them servants, gospel faith and hope and love do not make them children. But they who
are placed under grace, whom the Spirit quickens, do these things of faith which worketh
by love in the hope of good things, not carnal but spiritual, not earthly but heavenly, not
temporal but eternal; especially believing on the Mediator, by whom they do not doubt but
that a Spirit of grace is ministered to them, so that they may do these things well, and that
they may be pardoned when they sin. These pertain to the new testament, are the children
of promise, and are regenerated by God the Father and a free mother. Of this kind were all
the righteous men of old, and Moses himself, the minister of the old testament, the heir of
the new,—because of the faith whereby we live, of one and the same they lived, believing
the incarnation, passion, and resurrection of Christ as future, which we believe as already
accomplished,—even until John the Baptist himself, as it were a certain limit of the old dispensation,
who, signifying that the Mediator Himself would come, not with any shadow of
the future or allegorical intimation, or with any prophetical announcement, but pointing
Him out with his finger, said: “Behold the Lamb of God; behold Him who taketh away the
sin of the world.”2720 As if saying, Whom many righteous men have desired to see, on whom,
as about to come, they have believed from the beginning of the human race itself, concerning
whom the promises were spoken to Abraham, of whom Moses wrote, of whom the law and
the prophets are witnesses: “Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.”
From this John and afterwards, all those things concerning Christ began to become past or
present, which by all the righteous men of the previous time were believed, hoped for, desired,
as future. Therefore the faith is the same as well in those who, although not yet in name,
were in fact previously Christians, as in those who not only are so but are also called so; and
in both there is the same grace by the Holy Spirit. Whence says the apostle: “We having the
same Spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, therefore have I spoken; we also
believe, and therefore speak.”2721</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—The Old Testament is Properly One Thing—The Old Instrument
Another.</head>
<p>Therefore, by a custom of speech already prevailing, in one way the law and all the
prophets who prophesied until John are called the “Old Testament;” although this is more
definitely called the “Old Instrument” rather than the “Old Testament;” but this name is
used in another way by the apostolical authority, whether expressly or impliedly. For the
apostle is express when he says, “Until this day, as long as Moses is read, remaineth the same
veil in the reading of the old testament; because it is not revealed, because it is made of no
effect in Christ.”2722 For thus certainly the old testament referred to the ministry of Moses.
Moreover, he says, “That we should serve in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness
of the letter,”2723 signifying that same testament under the name of the letter. In another
place also, “Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter,
but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh alive.”2724 And here, by the
mention of the new, he certainly meant the former to be understood as the old. But much
more evidently, although he did not say either old or new, he distinguished the two testaments
and the two sons of Abraham, the one of the bondwoman, the other of the free, as I have
above mentioned. For what can be more express than his saying, “Tell me, ye that desire to
be under the law, have ye not heard the law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons,
the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. But he who was of the bondwoman was
born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. Which things are in allegory;
for these are the two testaments; the one in the Mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which
is Agar. For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is associated with Jerusalem which now
is, for it is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our
mother?”2725 What is more clear, what more certain, what more remote from all obscurity
and ambiguity to the children of the promise? And a little after, “Now we, brethren, as Isaac
was, are the children of promise.”2726 Also a little after, “But we, brethren, are not children
of the bondwoman, but of the free,”2727 with the liberty with which Christ has made us free.
Let us, therefore, choose whether to call the righteous men of old the children of the bondwoman
or of the free. Be it far from us to say, of the bondwoman; therefore if of the free,
they pertain to the new testament in the Holy Spirit, whom, as making alive, the apostle
opposes to the killing letter. For on what ground do they not belong to the grace of the new

<head>Chapter 13.—Why One of the Covenants is Called Old, the Other New.</head>
<p>But some one will say, “In what way is that called the old which was given by Moses
four hundred and thirty years after; and that called the new which was given so many years
before to Abraham?” Let him who on this subject is disturbed, not litigiously but earnestly,
first understand that when from its earlier time one is called “old,” and from its posterior
time the other “new,” it is the revelation of them that is considered in their names, not their
institution. Because the old testament was revealed through Moses, by whom the holy and
just and good law was given, whereby should be brought about not the doing away but the
knowledge of sin,—by which the proud might be convicted who were desirous of establishing
their own righteousness, as if they had no need of divine help, and being made guilty of the
letter, might flee to the Spirit of grace, not to be justified by their own righteousness, but by
that of God—that is, by the righteousness which was given to them of God. For as the same
apostle says, “By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without
the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and by the prophets.”2728 Because the law,
by the very fact that in it no man is justified, affords a witness to the righteousness of God.
For that in the law no man is justified before God is manifest, because “the just by faith
lives.”2729 Thus, therefore, although the law does not justify the wicked when he is convicted
of transgression, it sends to the God who justifieth, and thus affords a testimony to the
righteousness of God. Moreover, the prophets offer testimony to God’s righteousness by
fore-announcing Christ, “who is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.”2730 But that law was kept hidden from the beginning, when nature itself convicted
wicked men, who did to others what they would not have done to themselves. But the revelation
of the new testament in Christ was made when He was manifested in the flesh, wherein
appeared the righteousness of God—that is, the righteousness which is to men from God.
For hence he says, “But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested.”2731
This is the reason why the former is called the old testament, because it was revealed in the
earlier time; and the latter the new, because it was revealed in the later time. In a word, it is
because the old testament pertains to the old man, from which it is necessary that a man
should make a beginning; but the new to the new man, by which a man ought to pass from
his old state. Thus, in the former are earthly promises, in the latter heavenly promises; because
this pertained to God’s mercy, that no one should think that even earthly felicity of any kind
whatever could be conferred on anybody, save from the Lord, who is the Creator of all

things. But if God is worshipped for the sake of that earthly happiness, the worship is that
of a slave, belonging to the children of the bondmaid; but if for the sake of God Himself, so
that in the life eternal God may be all things in all, it is a free service belonging to the children
of the freewoman, who is our mother eternal in the heavens—who first seemed, as it were,
barren, when she had not any children manifest; but now we see what was prophesied concerning
her: “Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest
not: for there are many children of the desolate more than of her who has an husband,”
2732—that is, more than of that Jerusalem, who in a certain manner is married in the
bond of the law, and is in bondage with her children. In the time, then, of the old testament,
we say that the Holy Spirit, in those who even then were the children of promise according
to Isaac, was not only an assistant, which these men think is sufficient for their opinion, but
also a bestower of virtue; and this they deny, attributing it rather to their free will, in contradiction
to those fathers who knew how to cry unto God with truthful piety, “I will love Thee,
O Lord, my strength.”2733</p>

<head>Chapter 14 <del>V.</del>—Calumny Concerning the Righteousness of the Prophets and
Apostles.</head>
<p>They say, moreover, “that all the apostles or prophets are not defined as entirely holy
by us, but that we say that they were less wicked in comparison with those that were worse;
and that this is the righteousness to which God affords His testimony, so that, as the
prophet says that Sodom was justified in comparison with the Jews, so also we say that the
saints exercised some goodness in comparison with criminal men.” Be it far from us to say
such things; but either they are not able to understand, or they are unwilling to observe, or,
for the sake of misrepresentation, they pretend that they do not know what we say. Let them
hear, therefore, either themselves, or rather those whom, as inexperienced and unlearned
persons, they are striving to deceive. Our faith—that is, the catholic faith—distinguishes the
righteous from the unrighteous not by the law of works, but by that of faith, because the
just by faith lives. By which distinction it results that the man who leads his life without
murder, without theft, without false-witness, without coveting other men’s goods, giving
due honour to his parents, chaste even to continence from all carnal intercourse whatever,
even conjugal, most liberal in alms-giving, most patient of injuries; who not only does not
deprive another of his goods, but does not even ask again for what has been taken away
from himself; or who has even sold all his own property and appropriated it to the poor,
and possesses nothing which belongs to him as his own;—with such a character as this,
laudable as it seems to be, if he has not a true and catholic faith in God, must yet depart
from this life to condemnation. But another, who has good works from a right faith which
worketh by love, maintains his continency in the honesty of wedlock, although he does not,
like the other, well refrain altogether, but pays and repays the debt of carnal connection,
and has intercourse not only for the sake of offspring, but also for the sake of pleasure, al-
though only with his wife, which the apostle allows to those that are married as pardonable;—
does not receive injuries with so much patience, but is raised into anger with the
desire of vengeance, although, in order that he may say, “As we also forgive our debtors,”
forgives when he is asked;—possesses personal property, giving thence indeed some alms,
but not as the former so liberally;—does not take away what belongs to another, but, although
by ecclesiastical, not by civil judgment, yet contends for his own: certainly this man, who
seems so inferior in morals to the former, on account of the right faith which he has in God,
by which he lives, and according to which in all his wrong-doings he accuses himself, and
in all his good works praises God, giving to himself the shame, to God the glory, and receiving
from Him both forgiveness of sins and love of right deeds,—shall be delivered for this life,
and depart to be received into the company of those who shall reign with Christ. Wherefore,
if not on account of faith? Which, although without works it saves no man (for it is not a
reprobate faith, since it worketh by love), yet by it even sins are loosed, because the just by
faith liveth; but without it, even those things which seem good works are turned into sins:

<pb n="1143"/>
“For everything which is not of faith is sin.”2734 And it is brought about, on account of this
great difference, that although with no possibility of doubt a persevering integrity of virginity
is preferable to conjugal chastity, yet a woman even twice married, if she be a catholic, is
preferred to a professed virgin that is a heretic; nor is she in such wise preferred because
this one is better in God’s kingdom, but because the other is not there at all. Now the former,
indeed, whom we have described as being of better morals, if a true faith be his, surpasses
the second one, although both will be in heaven; yet if the faith be wanting to him, he is so
surpassed by him that he himself is not there at all.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—The Perfection of Apostles and Prophets.</head>
<p>Since, then, all righteous men, both the more ancient and the apostles, lived from a right
faith which is in Christ Jesus our Lord; and had with their faith morals so holy, that although
they might not be of such perfect virtue in this life as that which should be after this life, yet
whatever of sin might creep in from human infirmity might be constantly done away by the
piety of their faith itself: it results from this that, in comparison with the wicked whom God
will condemn, it must be said that these were “righteous,” since by their pious faith they
were so far removed into the opposite of those wicked men that the apostle cries out, “What
part hath he that believeth with an infidel?”2735 But it is plain that the Pelagians, these
modern heretics, seem to themselves to be religious lovers and praisers of the saints, since
they do not dare to say that they were of an imperfect virtue; although that elected vessel
confesses this, who, considering in what state he still was, and that the body which is corrupted
drags down the soul, says, “Not that I have already attained or am yet perfect; brethren,
I count not myself to have apprehended.” 2736 And yet a little after, he who had denied
himself to be perfect says, “Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded,”2737 in
order that he might show that, according to the measure of this life, there is a certain perfection,
and that to that perfection this also is to be attributed, even although any one may
know that he is not yet perfect. For what is more perfect, or what was more excellent, than
the holy priests among the ancient people? And yet God prescribed to them to offer sacrifice
first of all for their own sins. And what is more holy among the new people than the apostles?
And yet the Lord prescribed to them to say in their prayer, “Forgive us our debts.” For all
the pious, therefore, who lie under this burden of a corruptible flesh, and groan in the infirmity
of this life of theirs, there is one hope: “We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our sins.”2738</p>

<p>They have not a righteous advocate, who are (even if that were the only difference)
distinguished absolutely and widely from the righteous. Be it far from us to say, as they
themselves slanderously affirm, that this just Advocate “spoke falsely by the necessity of the
flesh;” but we say that He, in the likeness of sinful flesh, in respect of sin, condemned sin.
And they, perchance not understanding this, and being blinded by the desire of misrepresentation,
and ignorant of the number of ways in which the name of sin is accustomed to be
used in the Holy Scriptures, declare that we affirm sin of Christ. Therefore we assert that
Christ both had no sin,—neither in soul nor in the body; and that, by taking upon Him flesh
in the likeness of sinful flesh, in respect of sin He condemned sin. And this assertion,
somewhat obscurely made by the apostle, is explained in two ways,—either that the likenesses
of things are accustomed to be called by the names of those things to which they are like,
so that the apostle may be understood to have intended to call this likeness of sinful flesh
by the name of “sin;” or else that the sacrifices for sins were under the law called “sins,” all
which things were figures of the flesh of Christ, which is the true and only sacrifice for
sins,—not only for those which are all washed away in baptism, but also for those which
afterwards creep in from the weakness of this life, on account of which the universal Church
daily cries in prayer to God, “Forgive us our debts,” and they are forgiven us by means of
that singular sacrifice for sins which the apostle, speaking according to the law, did not
hesitate to call “sin.” Whence, moreover, is that much plainer passage of his, which is not
uncertain by any twofold ambiguity, “We beseech you in Christ’s stead to be reconciled to
God. He made Him to be sin for us, who had not known sin; that we might be the righteousness
of God in Him.” 2739 For the passage which I have above mentioned, “In respect of sin,
He condemned sin,” because it was not said, “In respect of his sin,” may be understood by
any one, as if He said that He condemned sin in respect of the sin of the Jews; because in
respect of their sin who crucified Him, it happened that He shed His blood for the remission
of sins. But this passage, where God is said to have made Christ Himself “sin,” who had not
known sin, does not seem to me to be more fittingly understood than that Christ was made
a sacrifice for sins, and on this account was called “sin.”</p>

<p>But who can bear their objecting to us, “that we say that after the resurrection such is
to be our progress, that there men can begin to fulfil the commands of God, which they
would not here;” since we say that there there will be no sin at all, no struggle with any desire
of sin; as if they themselves would dare to deny this? That wisdom also and the knowledge
of God, is then perfected in us, and that in the Lord there is such rejoicing that it is a full
and a true security, who will deny, unless he is so averse from the truth that on this very
account he cannot attain unto it? But these things will not be in precepts, but in reward of
those precepts which should here be observed; the neglect of which precepts, indeed, does
not lead thither to the reward. But here the grace of God gives the desire of keeping His
commandments; and if anything in these commandments is less perfectly observed, He
forgives it on account of what we say in prayer, as well “Thy will be done,” as “Forgive us
our debts.” Here, then, it is prescribed that we sin not; there, the reward is that we cannot
sin. Here, the precept is that we obey not the desires of sin; there, the reward that we have
no desires of sin. Here, the precept is, “Understand, ye senseless among the people; and ye
fools, be at some time wise;”2740 there, the reward is full wisdom and perfect knowledge.
“For we see now through a glass in an enigma,” says the apostle, “but then face to face: now
I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known.”2741 Here, the precept is,
“Exult unto the Lord, our helper,”2742 and, “Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord;”2743 there,
the reward is to rejoice with a perfect and unspeakable joy. Lastly, in the precept it is written,
“Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness;” but in the reward, “Because
they shall be filled.”2744 Whence, I ask, shall they be filled, except with what they hunger
and thirst after? Who, then, is so abhorrent, not only from the divine perception, but also
from the human perception, as to say that in man there can be such righteousness while he
is hungering and thirsting for it, as there will be when he shall be filled with it? But when

<head>Chapter 18.—Perfection of Righteousness and Full Security Was Not Even in Paul
in This Life.</head>
<p>But how impudent I do not say, but how insane, is the pride which, not yet being equal
to the angels of God, thinks itself already able to have a righteousness equal to the angels of
God; and does not consider so great and holy a man, who assuredly hungered and thirsted
after that very perfection of righteousness, when he was unwilling to be lifted up by the
greatness of his revelations; and yet that he might not be lifted up, he was not left to his own
choice and will, but received “the thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet him; on
which account he besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from him, and the Lord said
unto him, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.”2747
What strength, save that to which it belongs not to be lifted up? And who doubts that this
belongs to righteousness? The angels of God, then, are endowed with this perfection of
righteousness, since they always behold the face of the Father, and thus of the entire Trinity,
because they see through the Son, in the Holy Spirit. But nothing is more sublime than that
revelation, nor yet does any of the angels in that contemplation of rejoicing ones find a
messenger of Satan needful that he may be buffeted by him, lest so great a magnitude of
revelation should lift him up. The apostle Paul certainly had not yet that perfection of virtue,
nor yet was he equal to the angels of God; but there was in him the weakness of lifting
himself up, which also had to be checked by the angel of Satan, lest he should be lifted up
by the magnitude of his revelations. Although, then, the first lifting up cast down Satan,2748
yet that greatest Physician, who well knew how to make use of even evil things, applied from
the angel of Satan, against the mischief of elation, a wholesome, although a painful, medicament,
just as an antidote used to be made even of serpents against the poisons of serpents.
What, then, is the meaning of “My grace is sufficient for thee,” except that you may not by
giving way succumb to the buffet of the messenger of Satan? And what is “Strength is made
perfect in weakness,” except that in that place of weakness hitherto, there may be the perfection
of virtue, so that in the very presence of infirmity, lifting-up may be repressed? Which
infirmity assuredly shall be healed by future immortality. For how is that soundness to be
called perfect where medicine is still needful, even from the buffet of an angel of Satan?</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—In What Sense the Righteousness of Man in This Life is Said to Be
Perfect.</head>
<p>From this it results that the virtue which is now in the righteous man is named perfect
up to this point, that to its perfection belong both the true knowledge and humble confession
of even imperfection itself. For, in respect to this infirmity, that little righteousness of man’s
is perfect according to its measure, when it understands even what it lacks. And therefore
the apostle calls himself both perfect and imperfect,2749—imperfect, to wit, in the thought
of how much is wanting to him for the righteousness for the fulness of which he is still
hungering and thirsting; but perfect in that he does not blush to confess his own imperfection,
and goes forward in good that he may attain. As we can say that the wayfarer is perfect
whose approach is well forwarded, although his intention is not carried out unless his arrival
be actually effected. Therefore, when he had said, “According to the righteousness which is
in the law, I am one who has been without blame,” he immediately added, “What things
were gain to me, those I counted but loss for Christ’s sake. Yea, doubtless, and I count all
things to be loss for the sake of the eminent knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord: for whose
sake I have believed all things not only to be losses, but I have thought them to be even as
dung, that I might gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness,
which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of
God in faith.”2750 See! the apostle does not, of course, say falsely, that “according to the
righteousness which is of the law he was without blame;” and yet those things which were
gain to him, he casts away for Christ’s sake, and thinks them losses, injuries, dung. And not
only these things, but all other things which he mentioned previously; not on account of
any kind of knowledge, but, as he himself says, “the eminent knowledge of Christ Jesus our
Lord,” which, beyond a doubt, he had as yet in faith, but not yet in sight. For then the
knowledge of Christ will be eminent, when He shall be so revealed that what is believed is
seen. Whence, in another place, he thus says, “For ye have died, and your life is hidden with
Christ in God. When Christ, your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in
glory.”2751 Hence, also, the Lord Himself says, “He who loveth me shall be loved of my
Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”2752 Hence John the Evangelist
says, “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be:
but we know, that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He

<head>Chapter 20.—Why the Righteousness Which is of the Law is Valued Slightly by Paul.</head>
<p>Therefore the blessed Paul casts away those past attainments of his righteousness, as
“losses” and “dung,” that “he may win Christ and be found in Him, not having his own
righteousness, which is of the law.” Wherefore his own, if it is of the law? For that law is the
law of God. Who has denied this, save Marcion and Manicheus, and such like pests? Since,
then, that is the law of God, he says it is “his own” righteousness “which is of the law;” and
this righteousness of his own he would not have, but cast it forth as “dung.” Why so, except
because it is this which I have above demonstrated,2754 that those are under the law who,
being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going about to establish their own, are not
subject to the righteousness of God?2755 For they think that, by the strength of their own
will, they will fulfil the commands of the law; and wrapped up in their pride, they are not
converted to assisting grace. Thus the letter killeth2756 them either openly, as being guilty
to themselves, by not doing what the law commands; or by thinking that they do it, although
they do it not with spiritual love, which is of God. Thus they remain either plainly wicked
or deceitfully righteous,—manifestly cut off in open unrighteousness, or foolishly elated in
fallacious righteousness. And by this means—marvellous indeed, but yet true—the righteousness
of the law is not fulfilled by the righteousness which is in the law, or by the law,
but by that which is in the Spirit of grace. Because the righteousness of the law is fulfilled
in those, as it is written, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
But, according to the righteousness which is in the law, the apostle says that he was blameless
in the flesh, not in the Spirit; and he says that the righteousness which is of the law was his,
not God’s. It must be understood, therefore, that the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled
according to the righteousness which is in the law or of the law, that is, according to the
righteousness of man, but according to the righteousness which is in the Spirit of grace,
therefore according to the righteousness of God, that is, which man has from God. Which
may be thus more clearly and briefly stated: That the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled
when the law commands, and man as it were of his own strength obeys; but when the Spirit
aids, and man’s free will, but freed by the grace of God, performs. Therefore the righteousness
of the law is to command what is pleasing to God, to forbid what is displeasing; but the
righteousness in the law is to obey the letter, and beyond it to seek for no assistance of God
for holy living. For when he had said, “Not having my own righteousness, which is of the
law, but that which is by the faith of Christ,” he added, “Which is from God.” That, therefore,
is itself the righteousness of God, being ignorant of which the proud go about to establish

because man has it from God.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—That Righteousness is Never Perfected in This Life.</head>
<p>Now, according to this righteousness of God, that is, which we have from God, faith
now worketh by love. But it worketh that, in what way man can attain to Him on whom
now, not seeing, he believes; and when he shall see Him, then that which was in faith through
a glass enigmatically, shall at length be in sight face to face; and then shall be perfected even
love itself. Because it is said with excessive folly, that God is loved as much before He is seen,
as He will be loved when He is seen. Further, if in this life, as no religious person doubts,
the more we love God, so much the more righteous we certainly are, who can doubt that
pious and true righteousness will then be perfected when the love of God shall be perfect?
Then the law, therefore, shall be fulfilled; so that nothing at all is wanting to it, of which law,
according to the apostle, the fulfilling is Love. And thus, when he had said, “Not having my
own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Jesus Christ, which
is the righteousness from God in faith,” he then added, “That I may know Him, and the
power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.”2757 All these things were
not yet full and perfect in the apostle; but, as if he were placed on the way, he was running
towards their fulness and perfection. For how had he already perfectly known Christ, who
says in another place, “Now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known”?2758
And how had he already perfectly known the power of His resurrection, to whom it remained
to know it yet more fully by experience at the time of the resurrection of the flesh? And how
had he perfectly known already the fellowship of His suffering, if he had not yet experienced
for him the suffering of death? Finally, he adds and says, “If in any manner I may attain
unto the resurrection of the dead.”2759 And then he says, “Not that I have already received
or am already perfected.” What, then, does he confess that he has not yet received, and in
what is he not yet perfected, except that righteousness which is of God, which he desired,
not willing to have his own righteousness, which is of the law? For hence he was speaking,
and such was the reason for his saying these things in resistance to the enemies of the grace
of God, for the bestowal of which Christ was crucified; and of the race of whom are also
these.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Nature of Human Righteousness and Perfection.</head>
<p>For from the place in which he undertook to say these things, he thus began, “Beware
of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. For we are the circumcision, who
serve God in the Spirit,”—or, as some codices have it, “who serve God the Spirit,” or “the
Spirit of God,”—“and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.”2760 Here
it is manifest that he is speaking against the Jews, who, observing the law carnally, and going
about to establish their own righteousness, were slain by the letter, and not made alive by
the Spirit, and gloried in themselves while the apostles and all the children of the promise
were glorying in Christ. Then he added, “Although I may have confidence in the flesh. If
any one else thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I more.”2761 And enumerating all
things which have glory according to the flesh, he ended at that point where he says, “According
to the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.” And when he had said that he
regarded all these things as altogether loss and disadvantage and dung that he might gain
Christ, he added the passage which I am treating, “And be found in Him, not having my
own righteousness, but that which is by the faith of Christ, which is from God.” He confessed
that he had not yet received the perfection of this righteousness, which will not be except
in that excellent knowledge of Christ, on account of which he said that all things were loss
to him; and he confessed, therefore, that he was not yet perfect. “But I follow on,” said he,
“if I may apprehend that in which I also am apprehended of Christ Jesus.”2762 “I may apprehend
that in which I also am apprehended,” is much the same as, “I may know, even as I
also am known.” “Brethren,” says he, “I count not myself to have apprehended: but one
thing, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those which are
before, I follow on according to the purpose for the reward of the supreme calling of God
in Christ Jesus.”2763 The order of the words is, “But one thing I follow.” Of which one thing
the Lord also is well understood to have admonished Martha, where he says, “Martha,
Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is needful.”2764 The
apostle, wishing to apprehend this as if set in the way, said that he followed on to the reward
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. For who can delay when he would apprehend that
which he declares that he is following, that he shall then have a righteousness equal to the
righteousness of the holy angels, none of whom, of course, does any messenger of Satan
buffet lest he should be lifted up with the greatness of his revelations? Then, admonishing
those who might think themselves already perfect with the fulness of that righteousness, he

says, “Let as many of us, therefore, as are perfect, be thus minded.”2765 As if he should say,
If, according to the capacity of mortal man for the little measure of this life, we are perfect,
let us understand that it also belongs to that perfection that we perceive that we are not yet
perfected in that angelical righteousness which we shall have in the manifestation of Christ.
“And if in anything,” he said, “ye be otherwise minded, God shall also reveal even this unto
you.”2766 How, save to those that are walking and advancing in the way of the faith, until
that wandering be finished and they come to the actual vision? Whence following on, he
added, “Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk therein.”2767 Then
he concludes that they should be bewared of, concerning whom this passage treated at its
beginning. “Brethren, be imitators of me, and mark them which so walk as ye have our example.
For many walk, of whom I have spoken often, and now tell you even weeping, whose
end is destruction,”2768 and the rest. These are the very ones of whom, in the beginning, he
had said, “Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers,” and what follows. Therefore all are enemies
of the cross of Christ who, going about to establish their own righteousness, which
is of the law,—that is, where only the letter commands, and the Spirit does not fulfil,—are
not subject to the law of God. For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made an empty
thing. “If righteousness is by the law, then Christ has died in vain: then is the offence of the
cross done away.” And thus those are enemies of the cross of Christ who say that righteousness
is by the law, to which it belongs to command, not to assist. But the grace of God
through Jesus Christ the Lord in the Holy Spirit helpeth our infirmity.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—There is No True Righteousness Without the Faith of the Grace of
Christ.</head>
<p>Wherefore he who lives according to the righteousness which is in the law, without the
faith of the grace of Christ, as the apostle declares that he lived blameless, must be accounted
to have no true righteousness; not because the law is not true and holy, but because to wish
to obey the letter which commands, without the Spirit of God which quickens, as if of the
strength of free will, is not true righteousness. But the righteousness according to which the
righteous man lives by faith, since man has it from God by the Spirit of grace, is true righteousness.
And although this is not undeservedly said to be perfect in some righteous men,
according to the capacity of this life, yet it is but little to that great righteousness which the
equality of the angels receives. And he who had not yet possessed this, on the one hand, in
respect of that which was already in him, said that he was perfect; and in respect of that
which was still wanting to him, said that he was imperfect. But manifestly that lower degree
of righteousness makes merit, that higher kind becomes reward. Whence he who does not
strive after the former does not attain unto the latter. Wherefore, after the resurrection of
man, to deny that there will be a fulness of righteousness, and to think that the righteousness
in the body of that life will be such as it can be in the body of this death, is singular folly.
But it is most true that men do not there begin to fulfil those commands of God which here
they have been unwilling to obey. For there will be the fulness of the most perfect righteousness,
yet not of men striving after what is commanded, and making gradual endeavours
after that fulness; but in the twinkling of an eye, even as shall be that resurrection of the
dead itself, because that greatness of perfect righteousness will be given as a reward to those
who here have obeyed the commandments, and will not itself be commanded to them as a
thing to be accomplished. But I should in such wise say they have done the commandments,
that we might remember that to these very commandments belongs the prayer in which the
holy children of promise daily say with truth, “Thy will be done,”2769 and “Forgive us our
debts.”2770</p>

<head>Chapter 24 <del>VIII.</del>—There are Three Principal Heads in the Pelagian Heresy.</head>
<p>When, then, the Pelagians are pressed with these and such like testimonies and words
of truth, not to deny original sin; not to say that the grace of God whereby we are justified
is not given freely, but according to our merits; nor to say that in mortal man, however holy
and well doing, there is so great righteousness that even after the washing of regeneration,
until he finishes this life of his, forgiveness of sins is not necessary to him,—therefore when
they are pressed not to make these three assertions, and by their means alienate men who
believe them from the grace of the Saviour, and persuade the lifted-up unto pride to go
headlong unto the judgment of the devil: they introduce the clouds of other questions in
which their impiety—in the sight of men more simpleminded, whether that they are more
slow or less instructed in the sacred writings—may be concealed. These are the misty questions
of the praise of the creature, of the praise of marriage, of the praise of the law, of the
praise of free will, of the praise of the saints; as if any one of our people were in the habit of
disparaging those things, and not rather of announcing all things with due praises to the
honour of the Creator and Saviour. But even the creature does not desire in such wise to be
praised as to be unwilling to be healed. And the more marriage is to be praised, the less is
to be attributed to it the shameful concupiscence of the flesh, which is not of the Father, but
of the world; and which assuredly marriage found and did not make in men; because,
moreover, it is actually in very many without marriage, and if nobody had sinned marriage
itself might be without it. And the law, holy and just and good, is neither grace itself, nor is
anything rightly done by it without grace; because the law is not given that it may give life,
but it was added because of transgression, that it might conclude all persons convicted under
sin, and that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.2771
And the free will taken captive does not avail, except for sin; but for righteousness, unless
divinely set free and aided, it does not avail. And thus, also, all the saints, whether from that
ancient Abel to John the Baptist, or from the apostles themselves up to this time, and
henceforth even to the end of the world, are to be praised in the Lord, not in themselves.
Because the voice, even of those earlier ones, is, “In the Lord shall my soul be praised.” 2772
And the voice of the later ones is, “By the grace of God I am what I am.”2773 And to all belongs,
“That he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.” And it is the common confession of
all, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”2774</p>

<p>But since, in these five particulars which I have set forth, in which they seek lurkingplaces,
and from which they weave misrepresentations, they are forsaken and convicted by
the divine writings, they have thought to deter those whom they could by the hateful name
of Manicheans, lest in opposition to their most perverse teachings their ears should be
conformed to the truth; because doubtless the Manicheans blasphemously condemn the
three former of those five dogmas, saying that neither the human creature, nor marriage,
nor the law was ordained by the supreme and true God. But they do not receive what the
truth says, that sin took its origin from free will, and that all evil, whether of angel or man,
comes from it; because they prefer to believe, in their turning aside from God, that the nature
of evil was always evil, and co-eternal with God. They, moreover, attack the holy patriarchs
and prophets with as many execrations as they can. This is the way in which the modern
heretics think, that by objecting the name of Manicheans, they evade the force of truth. But
they do not evade it; because it follows them up, and overturns at once Manicheans and
Pelagians. For in that when a man is born there is something good, so far as he is a man, he
condemns the Manichean, and praises the Creator; but in so far as he derives original sin,
he condemns the Pelagian, and holds a Saviour necessary. For even because that nature is
said to be healable, it repels both teachings; because it would not, on the one hand, have
need of medicine if it were sound, which is opposed to the Pelagian, nor could it be healed
at all if the evil in it were eternal and immutable, which is opposed to the Manichean.
Moreover, in that to marriage, which we praise as ordained of God, we do not say that the
concupiscence of the flesh is to be attributed, this is both contrary to the Pelagians, who
make this concupiscence itself a matter of praise, and contrary to the Manicheans, who attribute
it to a foreign and evil nature, when it really is an evil accidental to our nature, not
to be separated by the disjunction from God, but to be healed by the mercy of God. Moreover,
in that we say that the law, holy and just and good, was given not for the justification of the
wicked, but for the conviction of the proud, for the sake of transgressions,—this is, on the
one hand, opposed to the Manicheans, in that according to the apostle the law is praised;
and on the other opposed to the Pelagians, in that, in accordance with the apostle, no one
is justified by the law; and therefore, for the sake of making alive those whom the letter has
killed, that is, whom the law, enjoining good, makes guilty by transgressions, the Spirit of
grace freely brings aid. Also in that we say that the will is free in evil, but for doing good it
must be made free by God’s grace, this is opposed to the Pelagians; but in that we say it
originated from that which previously was not evil, this is opposed to the Manicheans. Again,
that we honour the holy patriarchs and prophets with praises due to them in God, is in opposition
to the Manicheans; but that we say that even to them, however righteous and
pleasing to God they might have been, the propitiation of the Lord was necessary, this is in

<pb n="1159"/>
opposition to the Pelagians. The catholic faith, therefore, finds them both, as it does also
other heretics, in opposition to it, and convicts both by the authority of the divine testimonies
and by the light of truth.</p>

<p>The Pelagians, indeed, add to the clouds which envelop their lurking-places the unnecessary
question concerning the origin of the soul, for the purpose of erecting a hiding-place
by disturbing manifest things by the obscurity of other matters. For they say “that we guard
the continuous propagation of souls with the continuous propagation of sin.” And where
and when they have read this, either in the addresses or in the writings of those who maintain
the catholic faith against this, I do not know; because, although I find something written by
catholics on the subject, yet the defence of the truth had not yet been undertaken against
those men, neither was there any anxiety to answer them. But this I say, that according to
the Holy Scriptures original sin is so manifest, and that this is put away in infants by the
laver of regeneration is confirmed by such antiquity and authority of the catholic faith, notorious
by such a clear concurrent testimony of the Church, that what is argued by the inquiry
or affirmation of anybody concerning the origin of the soul, if it is contrary to this, cannot
be true. Wherefore, whoever builds up, either concerning the soul or any other obscure
matter, any edifice whence he may destroy this, which is true, best founded, and best known,

<p>After having set aside in the former books the calumnies hurled against the Catholics, Augustin
here proceeds to open up the snares which lie hidden in the remaining part of the second
epistle of the Pelagians, in the five heads of their doctrine—in the praise, to wit, of the
creature, the praise of marriage, the praise of the law, the praise of free will, and the praise
of the saints; in connection with which heads the Pelagians malignantly boast that they
are at issue not more with the Manicheans than with the Catholics. Hence these five points
may bring us back to this, that they put forward their threefold error—namely, the two
first, the denial of original sin; the two following, the assertion that grace is given according
to merits; the fifth, their statement that the saints had not sinned in this life. Augustin
shows that both heresies, that of the Manicheans and that of the Pelagians, are opposed
and equally odious to the Catholic faith, whereby we profess, first, that the nature created
by a good God was good, but that, nevertheless, it is in need of a Saviour because of original
sin, which passed into all men from the transgression of the first man: then secondly,
that marriage is good, truly instituted by God, but that that concupiscence is evil which
was associated with marriage by sin: also thirdly that the law of God is good, but in such
wise as only to manifest sin, not to take it away: that fourthly free will is assuredly inherent
in the nature of man, but that now, however, it is so enslaved that it does not avail to the
doing of righteousness, unless when it shall have been made free by grace: but that fifthly
the saints, whether of the Old or New Testament, were indeed endued with a righteousness,
which was true but not perfect, nor so full that they should be free from all sin. In conclusion,
he brings forward the testimonies of Cyprian and Ambrose on behalf of the Catholic
faith, some concerning original sin, others about the assistance of grace, and the last concerning
the imperfection of present righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—The Subterfuges of the Pelagians are Five.</head>
<p>After the matters which I have considered, and to which I have answered, they repeat
the same things as those contained in the letter which I have refuted, but in a different
manner. For before, they put them forward as objecting to us things which we think as it
were falsely; but afterwards, as explaining what they themselves think, they have presented
the same things from the opposite side, adding two certain points which they had not
mentioned—that is, “that they say that baptism is necessary for all ages,” and “that by Adam
death passed upon us, not sins,” which things must also themselves be considered in their
own place. Hence, because in the former Book which I have just finished I said that they
alleged hindrances of five matters in which lurk their dogmas hostile to God’s grace and to
the catholic faith,—the praise, to wit, of the creature, the praise of marriage, the praise of
the law, the praise of free will, the praise of the saints,—I think it is more convenient to make
a general discrimination of all that they maintain, the contrary of which they object to us,
and to show which of those things pertain to any of those five, that so my answer may be
by that very distinction clearer and briefer.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="1163"/>
<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—The Praise of the Creature.</head>
<p>They accomplish the praise of the creature, inasmuch as it pertains to the human race
of which the question now is, in these statements: “That God is the Maker of all those that
are born, and that the sons of men are God’s work; and that all sin descends not from nature,
but from the will.” With this praise of the creature they connect, “that they say that baptism
is necessary for every age, so that,” namely, “the creature itself may be adopted among the
children of God; not because it derives anything from its parents which must be purified in
the laver of regeneration.” To this praise they add also, “that they say that Christ the Lord
was sprinkled with no stain of sin as far as pertains to His infancy;” because they assert that
His flesh was most pure from all contagion of sin, not by His own excellence and singular
grace, but by His fellowship with the nature which is shared by all infants. It also belongs
to this that they introduce the question “of the origin of the soul,” thus endeavouring to
make all the souls of infants equal to the soul of Christ, maintaining that they likewise are
sprinkled with no stain of sin. On this account, also, they say, “that nothing of evil passed
from Adam upon the rest of humanity except death, which,” they say, “is not always an evil,
since to the martyrs, for instance, it is for the sake of rewards; and it is not the dissolution
of the bodies, which in every kind of men shall be raised up, that can make death to be called
either good or evil, but the diversity of merits which arises from human liberty.” These
things they write in this letter concerning the praise of the creature.</p>
<p>They praise marriage truly according to the Scriptures, “because the Lord saith in the
gospel, He who made men from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Increase
and multiply, and replenish the earth.” Although this is not written in that passage of the
gospel, yet it is written in the law. They add, moreover, “What therefore God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.”2775 And these we acknowledge to be gospel words.</p>
<p>In the praise of the law they say, “that the old law was, according to the apostle, holy
and just and good; that on those who keep its commandments, and live righteously by faith,
such as the prophets and patriarchs, and all the saints, life eternal could be conferred.”</p>
<p>In the praise of free will they say, “that free will has not perished, since the Lord says by
the prophets, ‘If ye be willing and will hear me, ye shall eat the good things of the land: if ye
are unwilling, and will not hear, the sword shall devour you.’2776 And thus, also, it is that
grace assists the good purpose of any person, but yet does not infuse a desire of virtue into
the reluctant heart, because there is no acceptance of persons with God.”</p>
<p>In the praise of the saints they conceal themselves, saying “that baptism perfectly renews
men, inasmuch as the apostle is a witness who testifies that, by the washing of water, the
<note type="footnote">2775 Matt. xix. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">2776 Isa. i. 19.</note>

<pb n="1164"/>
Church is made out of the heathen holy and spotless;2777 that the Holy Spirit also assisted
pious souls in ancient times, even as the prophet says to God, ‘Thy good Spirit shall lead me
into the right way;’2778 that all the prophets, moreover, and apostles or saints, as well of the
New as of the Old Testament, to whom God gives witness, were righteous, not in comparison
with the wicked, but by the rule of virtue; and that in future time there is a reward as well
of good works as of evil. But that no one can then perform the commandment which here
he may have contemned, because the apostle said, ‘We must be manifested before the
judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things belonging to the body, according
to what he has done, whether good or evil.’”2779</p>
<p>In all these points, whatever they say of the praise of the creature and of marriage, they
endeavour to bring us back to this,—that there is no original sin; whatever of the praise of
law and of free will, to this, that grace does not assist without merit, and that thus grace is
no more grace; whatever of the praise of the saints, to this, that mortal life in the saints appears
not to have sin, and that it is not necessary for them to pray God for the remitting of
their debts.</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>III.</del>—The Catholics Praise Nature, Marriage, Law, Free Will, and the
Saints, in Such Wise as to Condemn as Well Pelagians as Manicheans.</head>
<p>Let every one who, with a catholic mind, shudders at these impious and damnable
doctrines, in this tripartite division, shun the lurking-places and snares of this fivefold error,
and be so careful between one and another as in such wise to decline from the Manicheans
as not to incline to the Pelagians; and again, so to separate himself from the Pelagians as
not to associate himself with the Manicheans; or, if he should already be taken hold of in
one or the other bondage, that he should not so pluck himself out of the hands of either as
to rush into those of the other. Because they seem to be contrary to one another; since the
Manicheans manifest themselves by vituperating these five points, and the Pelagians conceal
themselves by praising them. Wherefore he condemns and shuns both, whoever he may be,
who according to the rule of the catholic faith so glorifies the Creator in men, that are born
of the good creature of flesh and soul (for this the Manichean will not have), as that he yet
confesses that on account of the corruption which has passed over into them by the sin of
the first man, even infants need a Saviour (for this the Pelagian will not have). He who so
distinguishes the evil of shameful concupiscence from the blessing of marriage, as neither,
like the Manicheans, to reproach the source of our birth, nor, like the Pelagians, to praise
the source of our disorder. He who so maintains the law to have been given holy and just
and good through Moses by a holy and just and good God (which Manicheus, in opposition
to the apostle, denies), as to say that it both shows forth sin and yet does not take it away,
and commands righteousness which yet it does not give (which, again, in opposition to the
apostle, Pelagius denies). He who so asserts free will as to say that the evil of both angel and
man began, not from I know not what nature always evil, which is no nature, but from the
will itself, which overturns Manichean heresy, and nevertheless that even thus the captive
will cannot breathe into a wholesome liberty save by God’s grace, which overturns the
Pelagian heresy. He who so praises in God the holy men of God, not only after Christ
manifested in the flesh and subsequently, but even those of the former times, whom the
Manicheans dare to blaspheme, as yet to believe their own confessions concerning themselves,
more than the lies of the Pelagians. For the word of the saints is, “If we should say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”2780</p>

<head>Chapter 4 <del>IV.</del>—Pelagians and Manicheans on the Praise of the Creature.</head>
<p>These things being so, what advantage is it to new heretics, enemies of the cross of Christ
and opposers of divine grace, that they seem sound from the error of the Manicheans, if
they are dying by another pestilence of their own? What advantage is it to them, that in the
praise of the creature they say “that the good God is the maker of those that are born, by
whom all things were made, and that the children of men are His work,” whom the
Manicheans say are the work of the prince of darkness; when between them both, or among
them both, God’s creation, which is in infants, is perishing? For both of them refuse to have
it delivered by Christ’s flesh and blood,—the one, because they destroy that very flesh and
blood, as if He did not take upon Him these at all in man or of man; and the other, because
they assert that there is no evil in infants from which they should be delivered by the sacrament
of this flesh and blood. Between them lies the human creature in infants, with a good
origination, with a corrupted propagation, confessing for its goods a most excellent Creator,
seeking for its evils a most merciful Redeemer, having the Manicheans as disparagers of its
benefits, having the Pelagians as deniers of its evils, and both as persecutors. And although
in infancy there is no power to speak, yet with its silent look and its hidden weakness it addresses
the impious vanity of both, saying to the one, “Believe that I am created by Him who
creates good things;” and saying to the other, “Suffer me to be healed by Him who created
me.” The Manicheans say, “There is nothing of this infant save the good soul to be delivered;
the rest,” which belongs not to the good God, but to the prince of darkness, “is to be rejected.”
The Pelagians say, “Certainly there is nothing of this infant to be delivered, because we have
shown the whole to be safe.” Both lie; but now the accuser of the flesh alone is more bearable
than the praiser, who is convicted of cruelty against the whole. But neither does the
Manichean help the human soul by blaspheming God, the Author of the entire man; nor
does the Pelagian permit the divine grace to come to the help of human infancy by denying
original sin. Therefore it is by the catholic faith that God has mercy, seeing that by condemning
both mischievous doctrines it comes to the help of the infant for salvation. It says
to the Manicheans, “Hear the apostle crying, ‘Know ye not that your body is the temple of
the Holy Ghost in you?’2781 and believe that the good God is the Creator of bodies, because
the temple of the Holy Ghost cannot be the work of the prince of darkness.” It says to the
Pelagians, “The infant that you look upon ‘was conceived in iniquity, and in sin its mother
nourished it in the womb.’2782 Why, as if in defending it as free from all mischief, do you
not permit it to be delivered by mercy? No one is pure from uncleanness, not even the infant

<head>Chapter 5.—What is the Special Advantage in the Pelagian Opinions?</head>
<p>What advantage, then, is it to them that they say “that all sin descends not from nature,
but from the will,” and resist by the truth of this judgment the Manicheans, who say that
evil nature is the cause of sin; when by being unwilling to admit original sin although itself
also descends from the will of the first man, they make infants to depart in guilt from the
body? What advantage is it to them “that they confess that baptism is necessary for all ages,”
while the Manicheans say that it is superfluous for every age, while they say that in infants
it is false so far as it pertains to the forgiveness of sins? What advantage is it to them that
they maintain “the flesh of Christ” (which the Manicheans contend was either no flesh at
all, or a feigned flesh) to have been not only the true flesh, but also “that the soul itself was
stained by no spot of sin,” when other infants are by them so put on the same level with His
infancy, with not unequal purity, as that both that flesh does not appear to keep its own
holiness in comparison with these, and these obtain no salvation from that?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="1169"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—Not Death Alone, But Sin Also Has Passed into Us by Means of Adam.</head>
<p>In that particular, indeed, wherein they say “that death passed to us by Adam, not sins,”
they have not the Manicheans as their adversaries: since they, too, deny that original sin
from the first man, at first of pure and upright body and spirit, and afterwards depraved by
free will, subsequently passed and passes as sin into all with death; but they say that the flesh
was evil from the beginning, and was created by an evil spirit and along with an evil spirit;
but that a good soul—a portion, to wit, of God—for the deserts of its defilement by food
and drink, in which it was before bound up, came into man, and thus by means of copulation
was bound in the chain of the flesh. And thus the Manicheans agree with the Pelagians that
it was not the guilt of the first man that passed into the human race—neither by the flesh,
which they say was never good; nor by the soul, which they assert comes into the flesh of
man with the merits of its own defilements with which it was polluted before the flesh. But
how do the Pelagians say “that only death passed upon us by Adam’s means”? For if we die
because he died, but he died because be sinned, they say that the punishment passed without
the guilt, and that innocent infants are punished with an unjust penalty by deriving death
without the deserts of death. This, the catholic faith has known of the one and only mediator
between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who condescended to undergo death—that
is, the penalty of sin—without sin, for us. As He alone became the Son of man, in order that
we might become through Him sons of God, so He alone, on our behalf, undertook punishment
without ill deservings, that we through Him might obtain grace without good deservings.
Because as to us nothing good was due so to Him nothing bad was due. Therefore,
commending His love to them to whom He was about to give undeserved life, He was willing
to suffer for them an undeserved death. This special prerogative of the Mediator the Pelagians
endeavour to make void, so that this should no longer be special in the Lord, if Adam in
such wise suffered a death due to him on account of his guilt, as that infants, drawing from
him no guilt, should suffer undeserved death. For although very much good is conferred
on the good by means of death, whence some have fitly argued even “of the benefit of death;”
yet from this what can be declared except the mercy of God, since the punishment of sin is
converted into beneficent uses?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="1170"/>
<head>Chapter 7.—What is the Meaning of “In Whom All Have Sinned”?</head>
<p>But these speak thus who wish to wrest men from the apostle’s words into their own
thought. For where the apostle says, “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin, and so passed upon all men,”2784 they will have it there understood not that “sin” passed
over, but “death.” What, then, is the meaning of what follows, “Whereto all have sinned”?
For either the apostle says that in that “one man” all have sinned of whom he had said, “By
one man sin entered into the world,” or else in that “sin,” or certainly in “death.” For it need
not disturb us that he said not “in which” [using the feminine form of the pronoun], but “in
whom” [using the masculine] all have sinned; since “death” in the Greek language is of the
masculine gender. Let them, then, choose which they will,—for either in that “man” all have
sinned, and it is so said because when he sinned all were in him; or in that “sin” all have
sinned, because that was the doing of all in general which all those who were born would
have to derive; or it remains for them to say that in that “death” all sinned. But in what way
this can be understood, I do not clearly see. For all die in the sin; they do not sin in the death;
for when sin precedes, death follows—not when death precedes, sin follows. Because sin is
the sting of death—that is, the sting by whose stroke death occurs, not the sting with which
death strikes.2785 Just as poison, if it is drunk, is called the cup of death, because by that cup
death is caused, not because the cup is caused by the death, or is given by death. But if “sin”
cannot be understood by those words of the apostle as being that “wherein all have sinned,”
because in Greek, from which the Epistle is translated, “sin” is expressed in the feminine
gender, it remains that all men are understood to have sinned in that first “man,” because
all men were in him when he sinned; and from him sin is derived by birth, and is not remitted
save by being born again. For thus also the sainted Hilary understood what is written,
“wherein all have sinned;” for he says, “wherein,” that is, in Adam, “all have sinned.”2786
Then he adds, “It is manifest that all have sinned in Adam, as it were in the mass; for he
himself was corrupted by sin, and all whom he begot were born under sin.” When he wrote
this, Hilary, without any ambiguity, indicated how we should understand the words, “wherein
all have sinned.”</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Death Passed Upon All by Sin.</head>
<p>But on account of what does the same apostle say, that we are reconciled to God by
Christ, except on account of what we had become enemies? And what is this but sin? Whence
also the prophet says, “Your sins separate between you and God.”2787 On account of this
separation, therefore, the Mediator was sent, that He might take away the sin of the world,
by which we were separated as enemies, and that we, being reconciled, might be made from
enemies children. About this, certainly, the apostle was speaking; hence it happened that
he interposed what he says, “That sin entered by one man.” For these are his former words.
He says, “But God commendeth His love towards us in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified in His blood, we shall be saved
from wrath through Him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved in His life. And not only
so, but glorying also in God through Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom also we have now received
reconciliation.” Then he subjoins, “Therefore, as by one man sin entered into this
world, and death by sin, and so passed upon all men, for in him all have sinned.”2788 Why
do the Pelagians evade this matter? If reconciliation through Christ is necessary to all men,
on all men has passed sin by which we have become enemies, in order that we should have
need of reconciliation. This reconciliation is in the laver of regeneration and in the flesh
and blood of Christ, without which not even infants can have life in themselves. For as there
was one man for death on account of sin, so there is one man for life on account of righteousness;
because “as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive;”2789 and “as
by the sin of one upon all men to condemnation, so also by the righteousness of one upon
all men unto justification of life.”2790 Who is there that has turned a deaf ear to these
apostolical words with such hardiness of wicked impiety, as, having heard them, to contend
that death passed upon us through Adam without sin, unless, indeed, they are opposers of
the grace of God and enemies of the cross of Christ?—whose end is destruction if they
continue in this obstinacy. But let it suffice to have said thus much for the sake of that serpentine
subtlety of theirs, by which they wish to corrupt simple minds, and to turn them
away from the simplicity of the faith, as if by the praise of the creature.</p>

<head>Chapter 9 <del>V.</del>—Of the Praise of Marriage.</head>
<p>But further, concerning the praise of marriage,2791 what advantage is it to them that,
in opposition to the Manicheans, who assign marriage not to the true and good God, but
to the prince of darkness, these men resist the words of true piety, and say, “That the Lord
speaks in the gospel, saying, Who from the beginning made them male and female, and
said, Increase and multiply and replenish the earth. What therefore God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder”?2792 What does this profit them, by means of the truth to seduce
to a falsehood? For they say this in order that infants may be thought to be born free from
all fault, and thus that there is no need of their being reconciled to God through Christ,
since they have no original sin, on account of which reconciliation is necessary to all by
means of one who came into the world without sin, just as the enmities of all were caused
by means of one through whom sin entered into the world. And this is believed by catholics
for the sake of the salvation of the nature of men, without detracting from the praise of
marriage; because the praise of marriage is a righteous intercourse of the sexes, not a wicked
defence of vices. And thus, when, by their praise of marriage, these persons wish to draw
over men from the Manicheans to themselves, they desire merely to change their disease,
not to heal it.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Of the Praise of the Law.</head>
<p>Once more, in the praise of the law, what advantage is it to them that, in opposition to
the Manicheans, they say the truth when they wish to bring men from that view to this which
they hold falsely against the catholics? For they say, “We confess that even the old law, according
to the apostle, is holy and just and good, and that this could confer eternal life on
those that kept its commandments, and lived righteously by faith, like the prophets and
patriarchs, and all the saints.” By which words, very craftily expressed, they praise the law
in opposition to grace; for certainly that law, although just and holy and good, could not
confer eternal life on all those men of God, but the faith which is in Christ. For this faith
worketh by love, not according to the letter which killeth, but according to the Spirit which
maketh alive, to which grace of God the law, as it were a schoolmaster, leads by deterring
from transgression, that so that might be conferred upon man which it could not itself
confer. For to those words of theirs in which they say “that the law was able to confer
eternal life on the prophets and patriarchs, and all saints who kept its commandments,” the
apostle replies, “If righteousness be by the law, then has Christ died in vain.”2793 “If the inheritance
be by the law, then is it no more of promise.”2794 “If they which are of the law be
heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect.”2795 “But that no man is
justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident: for, The just by faith liveth.”2796 “But the
law is not of faith: but The man that doeth them shall live in them.”2797 Which testimony,
quoted by the apostle from the law, is understood in respect of temporal life, in respect of
the fear of losing which, men were in the habit of doing the works of the law, not of faith;
because the transgressors of the law were commanded by the same law to be put to death
by the people. Or, if it must be understood more highly, that “He who doeth these things
shall live in them” was written in reference to eternal life; the power of the law is so expressed
that the weakness of man in himself, itself failing to do what the law commands, might seek
help from the grace of God rather of faith, seeing that by His mercy even faith itself is bestowed.
Because faith is thus possessed, according as God has given to every one the measure
of faith.2798 For if men have it not of themselves, but men receive the Spirit of power and
of love and of continence, whence that very same teacher of the Gentiles says, “For we have
not received the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of continence,”2799—assuredly

<pb n="1174"/>
also the Spirit of faith is received, of which he says, “Having also the same Spirit of faith.”2800
Truly, then, says the law, “He who doeth these things shall live in them.” But in order to do
these things, and live in them, there is necessary not law which ordains this, but faith which
obtains this. Which faith, however, that it may deserve to receive these things, is itself given
freely.</p>

to be praised.2801 Because, by their different modes of speaking, and by variety of words in
all their arguments, they wish the law to be understood as “grace”—that, to wit, we may
have from the Lord God the help of knowledge, whereby we may know those things which
have to be done,—not the inspiration of love, that, when known, we may do them with a
holy love, which is properly grace. For the knowledge of the law without love puffeth up,
does not edify, according to the same apostle, who most openly says, “Knowledge puffeth
up, but love edifieth.”2802 Which saying is like to that in which it is said, “The letter killeth,
the spirit maketh alive.”2803 For “Knowledge puffeth up,” corresponds to “The letter killeth:”
and, “Love edifieth,” to “The spirit maketh alive;” because “the love of God is shed abroad
in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us.”2804 Therefore the knowledge of the
law makes a proud transgressor; but, by the gift of charity, he delights to be a doer of the
law. We do not then make void the law through faith, but we establish the law,2805 which
by terrifying leads to faith. Thus certainly the law worketh wrath, that the mercy of God
may bestow grace on the sinner, frightened and turned to the fulfilment of the righteousness
of the law through Jesus Christ our Lord, who is that wisdom of God of which it is written,
“She carries law and mercy on her tongue,”2806—law whereby she frightens, mercy by which
she may help,—law by His servant, mercy by Himself,—the law, as it were, in the staff which
Elisha2807 sent to raise up the son of the widow, and it failed to raise him up, “For if a law
had been given which could have given life, righteousness would altogether have been by
the law,”2808 but mercy, as it were, in Elisha himself, who, wearing the figure of Christ, by
giving life to the dead was joined in the signification of the great sacrament, as it were, of
the New Testament.</p>

<p>Moreover, that, in opposition to the Manicheans, they praise free will, making use of
the prophetic testimony, “If ye shall be willing and will hear me, ye shall eat what is good
in the land; but if ye shall be unwilling and will not hear me, the sword shall consume
you:”2809 what advantage is this to them, when, indeed, it is not so much against the
Manicheans that they are maintaining, as against the catholics that they are extolling, free
will? For they wish what is said, “If ye be willing and will hear me,” to be so understood, as
if in the preceding will itself were the merit of the grace that follows; and thus grace were
no more grace, seeing that it is not free when it is rendered as a debt. But if they should so
understand what is written, “If ye be willing,” as to confess that He prepares even that good
will itself of whom it is written, “The will is prepared by the Lord,”2810 they would use this
testimony as catholics, and not only would overcome the ancient heresy of the Manicheans,
but would not found the new one of the Pelagians.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—God’s Purposes are Effects of Grace.</head>
<p>What does it profit them, that in the praise of that same free will “they say that grace
assists the good purpose of every one”?2811 This would be received without scruple as being
said in a catholic spirit, if they did not attribute merit to the good purpose, to which merit
now a wage is paid of debt, not according to grace, but would understand and confess that
even that very good purpose, which the grace which follows assists could not have been in
the man if grace had not preceded it. For how is there a good purpose in a man without the
mercy of God first, since it is that very good will which is prepared by the Lord?2812 But
when they had said this, “that grace also assists every one’s good purpose,” and presently
added, “yet does not infuse the love of virtue into a resisting heart,” it might be fitly understood,
if it were not said by those whose meaning is known. For, for the resisting heart a
hearing for the divine call is first procured by the grace of God itself, and then in that heart,
now no more resisting, the desire of virtue is kindled. Nevertheless, in all things which any
one does according to God, His mercy precedes him. And this they will not have, because
they choose to be not catholics, but Pelagians. For it much delights a proud impiety, that
even that which a man is forced to confess to be given by the Lord should seem to be not
bestowed on himself, but repaid; so that, to wit, the children of perdition, not of the promise,
may be thought themselves to have made themselves good, and God to have repaid to those
who are now good, having been made so by themselves, the reward due for that their work.</p>

<p>What remained to the carrion skin whence it might be puffed up, and could disdain
when it glories to glory in the Lord?2824 What remained to it, when whatsoever it shall have
said that it has done in such a way that after that preceding merit of man had originated
from man, God should subsequently do that of which the man is deserving,—it shall be
answered, it shall be exclaimed against, it shall be contradicted, “I do it; but for my own holy
name’s sake; not for your sakes, do I do it, saith the Lord God”?2825 Nothing so overturns
the Pelagians when they say that the grace of God is given in respect of our merits. Which,
indeed, Pelagius himself condemned,2826 and if not by correcting it, yet by being afraid of
the Eastern judges. Nothing so overturns the presumption of men who say, “We do it, that
we may deserve those things with which God may do it.” It is not Pelagius that answers you,
but the Lord Himself, “I do it and not for your sakes, but for my own holy name’s sake.”2827
For what good can ye do out of a heart which is not good? But that you may have a good
heart, He says, “I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new Spirit within you.” Can you
say, We will first walk in His righteousness, and will observe His judgment, and will do so
that we may be worthy, such as He should give His grace to? But what good would ye evil
men do, and how should you do those good things, unless you were yourselves good? But
who causes that men should be good save Him who said, “And I will visit them to make
them good”? and who said “I will put my Spirit within you, and will cause you to walk in
my righteousness, and to observe my judgments, and do them”? Are ye thus not yet awake?
Do ye not yet hear, “I will cause you to walk, I will make you to observe,” lastly, “I will make
you to do”? What! are you still puffing yourselves up? We indeed walk, it is true; we observe;
we do; but He makes us to walk, to observe, to do. This is the grace of God making us good;
this is His mercy preventing us. What do waste and desolated and dug-up places deserve,
which yet shall be built and tilled and fortified? Are these things for the merits of their
wasteness, their desolation, their uprooting? Far from it. For such things as these are evil
deservings, while those gifts are good. Therefore good things are given for evil ones—gratuitous,
therefore; not of debt, and therefore grace. “I,” saith the Lord: “I, the Lord.” Does not
such a word as that restrain you, O human pride, when you say, I do such things as to deserve
from the Lord to be built and planted? Do you not hear, “I do it not on your account; I the
Lord have built up the destroyed cities, and I have planted the desolated lands; I the Lord
have spoken, and I have done it, yet not for your sakes, but for my own holy name’s sake”?

desolated cities to be full of men as sheep, save He who goes on, and says, “And they shall
know that I am the Lord”? But with what men as sheep does He fill the cities as He promised?
those which He finds, or those which He makes? Let us interrogate the Psalm; lo, it answers;
let us hear: “O come, let us worship and fall down before Him: and let us weep before the
Lord who made us; because He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the
sheep of His hand.”2828 He therefore makes the sheep, with which He may fill the desolated
cities. What wonder, when, indeed, to that single sheep, that is, the Church whose members
are all the human sheep, it is said, “Because I am the Lord who make thee”? What do you
pretend to me of free will, which will not be free to do righteousness, unless you should be
a sheep? He then who makes men His sheep, He frees the wills of men for the obedience of
piety.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Why God Makes of Some Sheep, Others Not.</head>
<p>But wherefore does God make these men sheep, and those not, since with Him there is
no acceptance of persons? This is the very question which the blessed apostle thus answers
to those who propose it with more curiosity than propriety, “O man, who art thou that
repliest against God? Does the thing formed say to him that formed it, Wherefore hast thou
made me thus?”2829 This is the very question which belongs to that depth desiring to look
into which the same apostle was in a certain measure terrified, and exclaimed, “Oh the depth
of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments,
and His ways past finding out! For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been
His counsellor? Or who has first given to Him, that it should be recompensed to Him again?
Because of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things: to Him be glory for ages of
ages.”2830 Let them not, then, dare to pry into that unsearchable question who defend
merit before grace, and therefore even against grace, and wish first to give unto God, that
it may be given to them again,—first, of course, to give something of free will, that grace
may be given them again as a reward; and let them wisely understand or faithfully believe
that even what they think that they have first given, they have received from Him, from
whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things. But why this man should
receive, and that should not receive, when neither of them deserves to receive, and whichever
of them receives, receives undeservingly,—let them measure their own strength, and not
search into things too strong for them. Let it suffice them to know that there is no unrighteousness
with God. For when the apostle could find no merits for which Jacob should take
precedence of his twin-brother with God, he said, “What, then, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness
with God? Away with the thought! For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on
whom I will have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.
Therefore it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy.”2831 Let, therefore, His free compassion be grateful to us, even although this profound
question be still unsolved; which, nevertheless, is so far solved as the same apostle solves it,
saying, “But if God, willing to show His wrath, and to demonstrate His power, endured in
much patience the vessels of wrath which are fitted to destruction; and that He might make
known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He has prepared for glory.”2832
Certainly wrath is not repaid unless it is due, lest there be unrighteousness with God; but
mercy, even when it is bestowed, and not due, is not unrighteousness with God. And hence,
let the vessels of mercy understand how freely mercy is afforded to them, because to the

<p>In that, indeed, in the praise of the saints, they will not drive us with the zeal of that

as it were, to overflow with sufficiency and fulness; what does it profit them that—in opposition
to the Manicheans, who do away with baptism—they say “that men are perfectly renewed
by baptism,” and apply the apostle’s testimony for this,—“who testifies that, by the
washing of water, the Church is made holy and spotless from the Gentiles,”2834—when,
with a proud and perverse meaning, they put forth their arguments in opposition to the
prayers of the Church itself. For they say this in order that the Church may be believed after
holy baptism—in which is accomplished the forgiveness of all sins—to have no further sin;
when, in opposition to them, from the rising of the sun even to its setting, in all its members
it cries to God, “Forgive us our debts.”2835 But if they are interrogated regarding themselves
in this matter, they find not what to answer. For if they should say that they have no sin,
John answers them, that they deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.2836 But if
they confess their sins, since they wish themselves to be members of Christ’s body, how will
that body, that is, the Church, be even in this time perfectly, as they think, without spot or
wrinkle, if its members without falsehood confess themselves to have sins? Wherefore in
baptism all sins are forgiven, and, by that very washing of water in the word, the Church is
set forth in Christ without spot or wrinkle;2837 and unless it were baptized, it would fruitlessly
say, “Forgive us our debts,” until it be brought to glory, when there is in it absolutely no
spot or wrinkle.2838</p>

whom God gives His witness, were righteous, not in comparison with the wicked, but by
the rule of virtue,” is not doubtful. And this is opposed to the Manicheans, who blaspheme
the patriarchs and prophets; but what is opposed to the Pelagians is, that all of these, when
interrogated concerning themselves while they lived in the body, with one most accordant
voice would answer, “If we should say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us.”2839 “But in the future time,” it is not to be denied “that there will be a
reward as well of good works as of evil, and that no one will be commanded to do the commandments
there which here he has contemned,” but that a sufficiency of perfect righteousness
where sin cannot be, a righteousness which is here hungered and thirsted after by the
saints, is here hoped for in precept, is there received as a reward, on the entreaty of alms
and prayers; so that what here may have been wanting in fulfilment of the commandments
may become unpunished for the forgiveness of sin.2840</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Pelagius, in Imitation of Cyprian, Wrote a Book of Testimonies.</head>
<p>Even that heresiarch of these men, Pelagius himself, mentions with the honour that is
certainly due to him, the most blessed Cyprian, most glorious with even the crown of martyrdom,
not only in the African and the Western, but also in the Eastern Churches, well
known by the report of fame, and by the diffusion far and wide of his writings,—when,
writing a book of testimonies,2841 he asserts that he is imitating him, saying that “he was
doing to Romanus what Cypria had done to Quirinus.” Let us, then, see what Cyprian
thought concerning original sin, which entered by one man into the world. In the epistle
on “Works and Alms”2842 he thus speaks: “When the Lord at His advent had cured these
wounds which Adam had introduced, and had healed the old poisons of the serpent, He
gave a law to the sound man, and bade him sin no more, lest a worse thing should happen
to him if he sinned. We had been limited and shut up into a narrow space by the commandment
of innocence; nor would the infirmity and weakness of human frailty have any resource
unless the divine mercy coming once more in aid should open some way of securing salvation
by pointing out works of justice and mercy, so that by alms-giving we may wash away
whatever foulness we subsequently contract.” By this testimony this witness refutes two
falsehoods of theirs,—the one, wherein they say that the human race draws no sin from
Adam which needs cure and healing through Christ; the other, in which they say that the
saints have no sin after baptism. Again, in the same epistle2843 he says, “Let each one place
before his eyes the devil with his servants,—that is, with the people of perdition and death,—as
springing forth into the midst and provoking the people of Christ,—Himself being present
and judging,—with the trial of comparison in these words: ‘I, on behalf of those whom thou
seest with me, neither received buffets, nor bore scourgings, nor endured the cross, nor shed
my blood, nor redeemed my family at the price of my suffering and blood; but neither do
I promise them a celestial kingdom, nor do I recall them to Paradise, having again restored
to them immortality.’” Let the Pelagians answer and say when we could have been in the
immortality of Paradise, and how we could have been expelled thence so as to be recalled
thither by the grace of Christ. And, although they may be unable to find what they can answer
in this case on behalf of their own perversity, let them observe in what manner Cyprian
understood what the apostle says, “In whom all have sinned.” And let not the Pelagian
heretics, freed from the old Manichean heretics, dare to suggest any calumny against a
catholic, lest they should be convicted of doing so wicked a wrong even to the ancient
martyr Cyprian.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Further References to Cyprian.</head>
<p>For he says also this in the epistle whose title is inscribed, “On the Mortality:”2844 “The
kingdom of God, beloved brethren, is beginning to be at hand; the reward of life, and the
rejoicing of eternal salvation and perpetual gladness, and the possession formerly lost of
Paradise, are now coming with the passing away of the world.” This again, in the same
epistle, he says: “Let us greet the day which assigns each of us to his own home, which
snatches us hence and sets us free from the snares of the world, and restores us to Paradise
and the kingdom.” Moreover, he says in the epistle concerning Patience: “Let the judgment
of God be pondered, which, even in the beginning of the world and of the human race,
Adam, forgetful of the commandment and a transgressor of the law that had been given,
received. Then we shall know how patient in this life we ought to be, who are born in such
a state that we labour here with afflictions and contests. Because, says He, ‘thou hast
hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which alone I had charged
thee that thou shouldest not eat, cursed shall be the ground in all thy works: in sorrow and
in groaning shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns and thistles shall it give forth
to thee, and thou shall eat the food of the field. In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy
bread, till thou return unto the ground from which thou wast taken: for earth thou art, and
unto earth shalt thou go.’ We are all tied and bound with the chain of this sentence until,
death being destroyed, we depart from this world.”2845 And, moreover, in the same epistle
he says: “For, since in that first transgression of the commandment strength of body departed
with immortality, and weakness came on with death, and strength cannot be received unless
when immortality also has been received, it behoves us in this bodily frailty and weakness
always to struggle and fight; and this struggle and encounter cannot be sustained but by the
strength of patience.”2846</p>

<p>And in the epistle which he wrote with sixty-six of his joint-bishops to Bishop Fidus,
when he was consulted by him in respect of the law of circumcision, whether an infant might
be baptized before the eighth day, this matter is treated in such a way as if by a divine forethought
the catholic Church would already confute the Pelagian heretics who would appear
so long afterwards. For he who had consulted had no doubt on the subject whether children
on birth inherited original sin, which they might wash away by being born again. For be it
far from the Christian faith to have at any time doubted on this matter. But he was in doubt
whether the washing of regeneration, by which he made no question but that original sin
was put away, ought to be given before the eighth day. To which consultation the most
blessed Cyprian in reply said: “But as regards the case of infants, which you say ought not
to be baptized within the second or third day after their birth, and that the law of the ancient
circumcision should be regarded, so that you think that one who is born should not be
baptized and sanctified within the eighth day, we all thought very differently in our council.
For to the course which you thought was to be taken no one agreed, but we all rather judged
that the grace of a merciful God was not to be denied to any one born of men; for, as the
Lord says in His gospel, ‘the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.’
2847 As far as we can, we must strive that, if possible, no soul be lost.”2848 And a little afterwards
he says: “Nor ought any of us to shudder at what God hath condescended to make.
For although the infant is still fresh from its birth, yet it is not such that any one should
shudder at kissing it in giving grace and in making peace, since in the kiss of an infant every
one of us ought for his very religion’s sake to consider the still recent hands of God themselves,
which in some sort we are kissing in the man just formed and newly born, when we
are embracing that which God has made.”2849 A little after, also, he says: “But if anything
could hinder men from obtaining grace, their more heinous sins might rather hinder those
who are mature and grown up and older. But again, if even to the greatest sinners, and to
those who have before sinned much against God, when they have subsequently believed,
remission of sins is granted, and nobody is hindered from baptism and from grace; how
much rather ought we to shrink from hindering an infant, who, being lately born, has not
sinned, except that, being born after the flesh according to Adam, he has contracted the
contagion of the ancient death at his earliest birth; who approaches more easily on this very

<p>What will be said to such things as these, by those who are not only the forsakers, but
also the persecutors of God’s grace? What will they say to such things as these? On what
ground is the “possession of Paradise” restored to us? How are we restored to Paradise if
we have never been there? Or how have we been there, except because we were there in
Adam? And how do we belong to that “judgment” which was spoken against the transgressor,
if we do not inherit injury from the transgressor? Finally, he thinks that infants are to be
baptized, even before the eighth day; lest “by the contagion of the ancient death, contracted
in the first birth,” the souls of the infants should perish. How do they perish if they who are
born even of believing men are not held by the devil until they are born again in Christ, and
plucked out from the power of darkness, and transferred into His kingdom? And who says
that the souls of those who are born will perish unless they are born again? No other than
he who so praises the Creator and the creature, the workman and the work, as to restrain
and correct the horror of human feeling with which men refuse to kiss infants fresh from
the womb, by interposing the veneration of the Creator Himself, saying that in the kiss of
infants of that age the recent hands of God were to be considered! Did he, then, in confessing
original sin, condemn either nature or marriage? Did he, because he applied to the infant
born guilty from Adam, the cleansing of regeneration, therefore deny God as the Creator
of those that were born? Because, in his dread that souls of any age whatever should perish,
he, with his council of colleagues, decided that even before the eighth day they were to be
delivered by the sacrament of baptism, did he therefore accuse marriage, when, indeed, in
the case of an infant,—whether born of marriage or of adultery, yet because it was born a
man,—he declared that the recent hands of God were worthy even of the kiss of peace? If,
then, the holy bishop and most glorious martyr Cyprian could think that original sin in infants
must be healed by the medicine of Christ, without denying the praise of the creature,
without denying the praise of marriage, why does a novel pestilence, although it does not
dare to call such an one as him a Manichean, think that another person’s fault is to be objected
against catholics who maintain these things, in order to conceal its own? So the most lauded
commentator on the divine declarations, before even the slightest taint of the Manichean
plague had touched our lands, without any reproach of the divine work and of marriage,
confesses original sin,—not saying that Christ was stained with any spot of sin, nor yet
comparing with Him the flesh of sin in others that were born, to whom by means of the
likeness of sinful flesh He might afford the aid of cleansing; neither is he deterred by the
obscure question of the origin of souls, from confessing that those who are made free by
the grace of Christ return into Paradise. Does he say that the condition of death passed upon
men from Adam without the contagion of sin? For it is not on account of avoiding the death

<pb n="1193"/>
of the body, but on account of the sin which entered by one man into the world,2851 that
he says that help is to be afforded by baptism to infants, however fresh they may be from
the womb.</p>

<head>Chapter 25 <del>IX.</del>—Cyprian’s Testimonies Concerning God’s Grace.</head>
<p>But now it plainly appears in what way Cyprian proclaims the grace of God against such
as these, when he is arguing about the Lord’s Prayer. For he says: “We say, ‘May Thy name
be made holy,’2852 not that we wish for God that He may be made holy by our prayers, but
that we beseech of Him that His name may be made holy in us. But by whom is God made
holy, since He Himself makes holy? But, because He says, ‘Be ye holy, because I also am
holy,’ we ask and entreat this, that we who were made holy in baptism may continue in that
which we have begun to be.”2853 And in another place in the same epistle he says: “We add
also, and say, ‘Thy will be done in heaven, and in earth,’ not in order that God may do what
He wills, but that we may be able to do what God wills. For who resists God that He may
not do what He wills? But, since we are hindered by the devil from obeying God with our
thought and deed in all things, we pray and ask that God’s will may be done in us. And that
it may be done in us, we have need of God’s will, that is, of His help and protection; since
no one is strong in his own strength, but he is safe by the indulgence and mercy of God.”2854
In another place also: “Moreover, we ask that the will of God may be done both in heaven
and in earth, each of which things pertains to the fulfilment of our safety and salvation. For
since we possess the body from the earth, and the spirit from heaven, we are ourselves earth
and heaven; and in both, that is, both in body and in spirit, we pray that God’s will be done.
For between the flesh and the spirit there is a struggle, and there is a daily strife as they disagree
one with the other; so that we cannot do the very things that we would, in that the
spirit seeks heavenly and divine things, while the flesh lusts after earthly and temporal things.
And, therefore, we ask that, by the help and assistance of God, agreement may be made
between these two natures; so that while the will of God is done both in the spirit and in the
flesh, the soul which is newborn by Him may be preserved. And this the Apostle Paul openly
and manifestly declares by his words. ‘The flesh,’ says he, ‘lusteth against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the
things that ye would.’”2855 And a little after he says: “And it may be thus understood, most
beloved brethren, that since the Lord commands and teaches us even to love our enemies,
and to pray even for those who persecute us, we should ask even for those who are still earth,
and have not yet begun to be heavenly, that even in respect of these God’s will may be done,
which Christ accomplished in preserving and renewing humanity.”2856 And again, in another
place he says: “But we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we who are

in Christ, and daily receive the Eucharist for the food of salvation, may not, by the interposition
of some more heinous sin,—by being prevented, as those abstaining and not communicating,
from partaking of the heavenly bread,—be separated from Christ’s body.”2857 And
a little afterwards, in the same treatise he says: “But when we ask that we may not come into
temptation, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness, while we so ask as that no one
should insolently vaunt himself; that none should proudly and arrogantly assume anything
to himself; that none should take to himself the glory either of confession or of suffering as
his own, when the Lord Himself teaching humility said, ‘Watch and pray, that ye come not
into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak;’2858 so that while a humble
and submissive confession comes first, and all is attributed to God, whatever is sought for
suppliantly, with fear and honour of God, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.”2859
Moreover, in his treatise addressed to Quirinus, in respect to which work Pelagius wishes
himself to appear as his imitator, he says in the Third Book “that we must boast in nothing,
since nothing is our own.”2860 And subjoining the divine testimonies to this proposition,
he added among others that apostolic word with which especially the mouths of such as
these must be closed: “For what hast thou, which thou hast not received? But if thou hast
received it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received it?” Also in the epistle concerning
Patience he says: “For we have this virtue in common with God. From Him patience begins;
from Him its glory and its dignity take their rise. The origin and greatness of patience proceed
from God as its Author.”2861</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—Further Appeals to Cyprian’s Teaching.</head>
<p>Does that holy and so memorable instructor of the Churches in the word of truth, deny
that there is free will in men, because he attributes to God the whole of your righteous living?
Does he reproach God’s law, because he intimates that man is not justified by it, seeing that
he declares that what that law commands must be obtained from the Lord God by prayers?
Does he assert fate under the name of grace, by saying that we must boast in nothing, since
nothing is our own? Does he, like these, believe that the Holy Spirit is in such wise the aider
of virtue, as if that very virtue which it assists springs from ourselves, when, asserting that
nothing is our own, he mentions in this respect that the apostle said, “For what hast thou
that thou hast not received?” and says that the most excellent virtue, that is, patience, does
not begin from us, and afterwards receive aid by the Spirit of God, but from Him Himself
takes its source, from Him takes its origin? Finally, he confesses that neither good purpose,
nor desire of virtue, nor good dispositions, begin to be in men without God’s grace, when
he says that “we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.” What is so established
in free will as what the law says, that we must not worship an idol, must not commit adultery,
must do no murder? Nay, these crimes, and such like, are of such a kind that, if any one
should commit them, he is removed from the communion of the body of Christ. And yet,
if the blessed Cyprian thought that our own will was sufficient for not committing these
crimes, he would not in such wise understand what we say in the Lord’s Prayer, “Give us
this day our daily bread,” as that he should assert that we ask “that we may not by the interposition
of some heinous sin—by being prevented as abstaining, and not communicating,
from partaking of the heavenly bread—be separated from Christ’s body.” Let these new
heretics answer of a surety what good merit precedes, in men who are enemies of the name
of Christ? For not only have they no good merit, but they have, moreover, the very worst
merit. And yet, Cyprian even thus understands what we say in the prayer, “Thy will be done
in heaven, and in earth:” that we pray also for those very persons who in this respect are
called earth. We pray, therefore, not only for the unwilling, but also for the objecting and
resisting. What, then, do we ask, but that from unwilling they may be made willing; from
objecting, consenting; from resisting, loving? And by whom, but by Him of whom it is
written, “The will is prepared by God”?2862 Let them, then, who disdain, if they do not do
any evil and if they do any good, to glory, not in themselves, but in the Lord, learn to be
catholics.</p>

<head>Chapter 27 <del>X.</del>—Cyprian’s Testimonies Concerning the Imperfection of Our Own
Righteousness.</head>
<p>Let us, then, see that third point, which in these men is not less shocking to every
member of Christ and to His whole body,—that they contend that there are in this life, or
that there have been, righteous men having absolutely no sin.2863 In which presumption
they most manifestly contradict the Lord’s Prayer, wherein, with truthful heart and with
daily words, all the members of Christ cry aloud, “Forgive us our debts.” Let us see, then,
what Cyprian, most glorious in the Lord, thought of this,—what he not only said for the
instruction of the Churches, not, of course, of the Manicheans, but of the catholics, but also
committed to letters and to memory. In the epistle on “Works and Alms,” he says: “Let us
then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the wholesome gift of the divine mercy, and let us who
cannot be without some wound of conscience heal our wounds by the spiritual remedies
for the cleansing and purging of our sins. Nor let any one so flatter himself with the notion
of a pure and immaculate heart, as, in dependence on his own innocence, to think that the
medicine needs not to be applied to his wounds; since it is written, ‘Who shall boast that he
hath a clean heart, or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?’2864 And again, in his epistle,
John lays it down and says, ‘If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us.’2865 But if no one can be without sin, and whoever should say that he is
without fault is either proud or foolish, how needful, how kind is the divine mercy, which,
knowing that there are still found some wounds in those that have been healed, has given
even after their healing wholesome remedies for the curing and healing of their wounds
anew!”2866 Again, in the same treatise he says: “And since there cannot fail daily to be sins
committed in the sight of God, there failed not daily sacrifices wherewith the sins might be
cleansed away.”2867 Also, in the treatise on the Mortality, he says: “Our warfare is with avarice,
with immodesty, with anger, with ambition; our trying and toilsome wrestling with
carnal vices, with the enticements of the world. The mind of man besieged, and on every
hand invested with the onsets of the devil, scarcely meets the repeated attacks, scarcely resists
them. If avarice is prostrated, lust springs up. If lust is overcome, ambition takes its place.
If ambition is despised, anger exasperates, pride puffs up, wine-bibbing entices; envy breaks
concord; jealousy cuts friendship; you are constrained to curse, which the divine law forbids;
you are compelled to swear, which is not lawful. So many persecutions the soul suffers daily,
with so many risks is the heart wearied; and yet it delights to abide here long among the

devil’s weapons, although it should rather be our craving and wish to hasten to Christ by
the aid of a quicker death.”2868 Again, in the same treatise he says: “The blessed Apostle
Paul in his epistle lays it down, saying, ‘To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain;’2869
counting it the greatest gain no longer to be held by the snares of this world, no longer to
be liable to the sins and vices of the flesh.”2870 Moreover, on the Lord’s Prayer, explaining
what it is we ask when we say, “Hallowed be thy name,” he says, among other matters: “For
we have need of daily sanctification, that we, who daily fall away, may wash out our sins by
continual sanctification.”2871 Again, in the same treatise, when he would explain our saying,
“Forgive us our debts,” he says: “And how necessarily, how providently and salutarily, are
we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our sins; and while
pardon is asked for from God, the soul recalls its own consciousness of guilt. Lest any one
should flatter himself as being innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish,
he is instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his sins.
Thus, moreover, John also in his epistle warns us, and says: ‘If we say that we have no sin,
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins.’”2872 Rightly, also, he proposed in his letter to Quirinus his own
most absolute judgment on this subject, to which he subjoined the divine testimonies, “That
no one is without filth and without sin.”2873 There also he set down those testimonies by
which original sin is confirmed, which these men endeavour to twist into I know not what
new and evil meanings, whether what the holy Job says, “No one is pure from filth, not one
even if his life be of one day upon the earth,”2874 or what is read in the Psalm, “Behold, I
was conceived in iniquity; and in sins hath my mother nourished me in the womb.”2875 To
which testimonies, on account of those also who are already holy in mature age, since even
they are not without filth and sin, he added also that word of the most blessed John, which
he often mentions in many other places besides, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves;”2876 and other passages of the same sentiment, which are asserted by all catholics,
by way of opposing those “who deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.”</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Cyprian’s Orthodoxy Undoubted.</head>
<p>Let the Pelagians say, if they dare, that this man of God was perverted by the error of
the Manicheans, in so praising the saints as yet to confess that no one in this life had attained
to such a perfection of righteousness as to have no sin at all, confirming his judgment by
the clear truth and divine authority of the canonical testimonies. For does he deny that in
baptism all sins are forgiven, because he confesses that there remain frailty and infirmity,
whence he says that we sin after baptism and even to the end of this life, having unceasing
conflict with the vices of the flesh? Or did he not remember what the apostle said about the
Church without spot, that he prescribed that no one ought so to flatter himself in respect
of a pure and spotless heart as to trust in his own innocence, and think that no medicine
needed to be applied to his wounds? I think that these new heretics may concede to this
catholic man that he knew “that the Holy Spirit even in the old times aided good dispositions;”
nay, even, what they themselves will not allow, that they could not have possessed
good dispositions except through the Holy Spirit. I think that Cyprian knew that all the
prophets and apostles or saints of any kind soever who pleased the Lord at any time were
righteous—“not in comparison with the wicked,” as they falsely assert that we say, “but by
the rule of virtue,” as they boast that they say; although Cyprian says, nevertheless, no one
can be without sin, and whoever should assert that he is blameless is either proud or a fool.
Nor is it with reference to anything else that he understands the Scripture, “Who shall boast
that he has a pure heart? or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?”2877 I think that
Cyprian would not have needed to be taught by such as these, what he very well knew, “that,
in the time to come, there would be a reward of good works and a punishment of evil works,
but that no one could then perform the commands which here he might have despised;”
and yet he does not understand and assert the Apostle Paul, who was assuredly not a contemner
of the divine commands, to have said, “To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,”
2878 on any other account, except that he reckoned it the greatest gain after this life no longer
to be held in worldly entanglements, no longer to be obnoxious to the sins and vices of the
flesh. Therefore the most blessed Cyprian felt, and in the truth of the divine Scriptures saw,
that even the life of the apostles themselves, however good, holy, and righteous, suffered
some involvements of worldly entanglements, was obnoxious to some sins and vices of the
flesh; and that they desired death that they might be free from those evils, and that they
might attain to that perfect righteousness which would not suffer such things, and which
would no more have to be achieved in the way of command merely, but to be received in
the way of reward. For not even when that shall have come for which we pray when we say,
“Thy kingdom come,” will there be in that kingdom of God no righteousness; since the
<note type="footnote">2877 Prov. xx. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2878 Phil. ii. 21.</note>

<pb n="1200"/>
apostle says, “The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and
joy in the Holy Ghost.”2879 Certainly these three things are commanded among other divine
precepts. Here righteousness is prescribed to us when it is said, “Do righteousness;”2880
peace is prescribed when it is said, “Have peace among yourselves;”2881 joy is prescribed
when it is said, “Rejoice in the Lord always.”2882 Let, then, the Pelagians deny that these
things shall be in the kingdom of God, where we shall live without end; or let them be so
mad, if it appears good, as to contend that righteousness, peace, and joy, will be such there
as they are here to the righteous. But if they both shall be, and yet shall not be the same, assuredly
here, in respect of the commandment of them, the doing is to be cared for,—there
the perfection is to be hoped for in the way of reward; when, not being withheld by any
earthly entanglements, and being liable to no sins and vices of the flesh (on account of which
the apostle, as Cyprian received this testimony, said that to die would be to him gain), we
may perfectly love God, the contemplation of whom will be face to face; we may also perfectly
love our neighbour, since, when the thoughts of the heart are made manifest, no suspicion
of any evil can disturb any one concerning any one.</p>

<head>Chapter 29 <del>XI.</del>—The Testimonies of Ambrose Against the Pelagians and First of
All Concerning Original Sin.</head>
<p>But now also to the most glorious martyr Cyprian, let me add, for the sake of more
amply confuting these men, the most blessed Ambrose; because even Pelagius praised him
so much as to say that in his writings could be found nothing to be blamed even by his enemies.
2883 Since, then, the Pelagians say that there is no original sin with which infants are
born, and object to the catholics the guilt of the Manichean heresy, who withstand them on
behalf of the most ancient faith of the Church, let this catholic man of God, Ambrose, praised
even by Pelagius himself in the truth of the faith, answer them concerning this matter. When
he was expounding the prophet Isaiah, he says: “Christ was, therefore, without spot, because
He was not stained even in the usual condition itself of birth.”2884 And in another place in
the same work, speaking of the Apostle Peter, he says: “He offered himself, which he thought
before to be sin, asking for himself that not only his feet but his head also should be washed,
because he had directly understood that by the washing of the feet, for those who fell in the
first man, the filth of the obnoxious succession was abolished.”2885 Also in the same work
he says: “It was preserved, therefore, that of a man and woman, that is, by that mingling of
bodies, no one could be seen to be free from sin; but He who is free from sin is free also
from this kind of conception.” Also writing against the Novatians he says: “All of us men
are born under sin. And our very origin is in corruption, as you have it read in the words
of David,2886 ‘For lo, I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins hath my mother brought me
forth.’”2887 Also in the apology of the prophet David, he says: “Before we are born we are
spotted with contagion, and before the use of light we receive the mischief of that origin.
We are conceived in iniquity.”2888 Also speaking of the Lord, he says: “It was certainly fitting
that He who was not to have the sin of a bodily fall, should feel no natural contagion of
generation. Rightly, therefore, David with weeping deplored in himself these defilements
of nature, and the fact that the stain had begun in man before his life.”2889 Again, in the
Ark of Noah he says: “Therefore by one Lord Jesus the coming salvation is declared to the
nations; for He only could be righteous, although every generation should go astray, nor
for any other reason than that, being born of a virgin, He was not at all bound by the ordin-

Whom, then, should I now call righteous unless Him who is free from those chains, whom
the bonds of our common nature do not hold fast?”2891 Behold, this holy man, most approved,
even by the witness of Pelagius, in the catholic faith, condemned the Pelagians who
deny original sin with such evidence as this; and yet he does not with the Manicheans deny
either God to be the Creator of those who are born, or condemn marriage, which God ordained
and blessed.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—The Testimonies of Ambrose Concerning God’s Grace.</head>
<p>The Pelagians say that merit begins from man by free will, to which God repays the
subsequent aid of grace. Let the venerable Ambrose here also refute them, when he says, in
his exposition of the prophet Isaiah, “that human care without divine help is powerless for
healing, and needs a divine helper.” Also, in the treatise which is inscribed, “On the Avoidance
of the World,”2892 he says: “Our discourse is frequent on the avoidance of this world; and
I wish that our disposition were as cautious and careful as our discourse is easy. But what
is worse, the enticement of earthly lusts frequently creeps in, and the flowing forth of vanities
takes hold of the mind, so that the very thing that you desire to avoid you think upon, and
turn over in your mind; and this it is difficult for a man to beware of, but to get rid of it is
impossible. Finally, that that is rather a matter to be wished than to be accomplished the
prophet testifies when he says, ‘Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to avarice.’2893
For our heart and our thoughts are not in our power, seeing that they are suddenly forced
forth and confuse the mind and the soul and draw them in other directions from those
which you have proposed for them;—they recall to things of time, they suggest worldly
things, they obtrude voluptuous thoughts, they inweave seducing thoughts, and, in the very
season in which we are proposing to lift up our mind, vain thoughts are intruded upon us,
and we are cast down for the most part to things of earth; and who is so happy as always to
rise upwards in his heart? And how can this be done without the divine help? Absolutely in
no manner. Finally, of old Scripture says the same thing, ‘Blessed is the man whose help is
of Thee, O Lord; in his heart is going up.’”2894 What can be said more openly and more
sufficiently? But lest the Pelagians perchance should answer that, in that very point in which
divine help is asked for, man’s merit precedes, saying that that very thing is merit, that by
his prayer he is desiring that divine grace should come to his assistance, let them give heed
to what the same holy man says in his exposition of Isaiah. He says: “And to pray God is a
spiritual grace; for no man says that Jesus is the Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.”2895 Whence
also, expounding the Gospel according to Luke,2896 he says: “You see certainly that everywhere
the power of the Lord cooperates with human desires, so that no man can build
without the Lord, no man can undertake anything without the Lord.” Because such a man
as Ambrose says this, and commends God’s grace, as it is fitting for a son of promise to do,
with grateful piety, does he therefore destroy free will? Or does he mean grace to be understood
as the Pelagians in their different discourses will have to appear nothing but law—so

that, for instance, God may be believed to help us not to do what we may know, but to know
what we may do? If they think that such a man of God as this is of this mind, let them hear
what he has said about the law itself. In the book “On the Avoidance of the World,” he says:
“The law could stop the mouth of all men; it could not convert their mind.”2897 In another
place also, in the same treatise, he says: “The law condemns the deed; it does not take away
its wickedness.”2898 Let them see that this faithful and catholic man agrees with the apostle
who says, “Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to those who are under
the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
Because by the law no flesh shall be justified in His sight.”2899 For from that apostolic
opinion Ambrose took and wrote these things.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—The Testimonies of Ambrose on the Imperfection of Present Righteousness.</head>
<p>But now, since the Pelagians say that there either are or have been righteous men in this
life who have lived without any sin, to such an extent that the future life which is to be hoped
for as a reward cannot be more advanced or more perfect, let Ambrose here also answer
them and refute them. For, expounding Isaiah the Prophet in reference to what is written,
“I have begotten and brought up children, and they have despised me,”2900 he undertook
to dispute concerning the generations which are of God, and in that argument he quoted
the testimony of John when he says, “He that is born of God sinneth not.”2901 And, treating
the same very difficult question, he says: “Since in this world there is none who is free from
sin; since John himself says, ‘If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar.’2902 But
if ‘they that are born of God sin not,’ and if these words refer to those of them who are in
the world, it is necessary that we should regard them as those numberless people who have
obtained God’s grace by the regeneration of the laver. But yet, when the prophet says, ‘All
things are waiting upon Thee, that Thou mayest give them meat in season. That Thou givest
them they gather for themselves; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled
with goodness. But when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled: Thou shall
take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned into their dust. Thou shall
send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and Thou shalt renew the face of the
earth,’2903 such things as these cannot seem to have been said of any time whatever but of
that future time, in which there shall be a new earth and a new heaven. Therefore they shall
be disturbed that they may take their beginning. ‘And when Thou openest Thy hand all
things shall be filled with goodness,’ which is not easily characteristic of this age. For concerning
this age what does Scripture say? ‘There is none that doeth good, no, not one.’2904
If, therefore, there are different generations,—and here the very entrance into this life is the
receiver of sins to such an extent that even he who begot should be despised; while another
generation does not receive sins;—let us consider whether by any means there may not be
a regeneration for us after the course of this life,—of which regeneration it is said, ‘In the
regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory.’2905 For as that is
called the regeneration of washing whereby we are renewed from the filth of sins washed
away, so that seems to be called a regeneration by which we are purified from every stain

of bodily materiality, and are regenerated in the pure sense of the soul to life eternal; so that
every quality of regeneration may be purer than of that washing, so that no suspicion of sins
can fall either on a man’s doings, or even on his very thoughts themselves.” Moreover, in
another place in the same work he says: “We see it to be impossible that any person created
in a body can be absolutely spotless, since even Paul says that he is imperfect. For thus he
has it: ‘Not that I have already received, or am already perfect;’2906 and yet after a little he
says, ‘As many of us, therefore, as are perfect.’2907 Unless, perchance, there is one perfection
in this world, another after this is completed, of which he says to the Corinthians, ‘When
that which is perfect is come;’2908 and elsewhere, ‘Till we all come into the unity of the faith,
and the knowledge of the Son of God, into the perfect man to the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ.’2909 As, then, the apostle says that many are placed in this world who are
perfect along with him, but who, if you have regard to true perfection, could not be perfect,
since he says, ‘We see now through a mirror, enigmatically; but then face to face: now I
know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known:’2910 so also there both are
those who are ‘spotless’ in this world, and will be those who are ‘spotless’ in the kingdom
of God, although certainly, if you consider it accurately, no person can be spotless, because
no person is without sin.” Also in the same he says: “We see that, while we live in this life,
we ought to purify ourselves and to seek God; and to begin from the purification of our
soul, and as it were to establish the foundations of virtue, so that we may deserve to attain
the perfection of our purgation after this life.” And again, in the same he says: “But laden
and groaning, who does not say, ‘O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
body of this death?’2911 So with the same teacher we give all varieties of interpretation. For
if he is unhappy who recognises himself as involved in the evils of the body, certainly
everybody is unhappy; for I should not call that man happy who, being confused with any
darkness of his mind, does not know his own condition. That, moreover, has not absurdly
come to be understood; for if a man who knows himself is unhappy, assuredly all are
wretched, because every one either recognises his weakness by wisdom, or by folly is ignorant
of it.” Moreover, in the treatise “On the Benefit of Death,” he says:2912 “Let death work in
us, in order that that may work life also, a good life after death,—that is, a good life after
victory, a good life after the contest is finished; so that now no longer the law of the flesh

may know how to resist the law of the mind, that no longer we may have any contention
with the body of death.” Again, in the same treatise he says: “Therefore, because the righteous
have this reward, that they see the face of God, and that light which lightens every man, let
us henceforth put on the desire of this kind of reward, that our soul may draw near to God,
our prayer may draw near to Him, our desire may cleave to Him, that we be not separated
from Him. And placed here as we are, let us by meditating, by reading, by seeking, be united
with God. Let us know Him as we can. For we know Him in part here; because here all
things are imperfect, there all are perfect; here we are infants, there we shall be strong men.
‘We see,’ says he, ‘now through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face.’ Then, His face
being revealed, we shall be allowed to look upon the glory of God, which now our souls,
involved in the compacted dregs of this body, and shadowed by some stains and filth of this
flesh, cannot clearly see. ‘For who,’ He says, ‘shall see my face and live?’ and rightly. For if
our eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun,—and if any one should gaze too long on the region
of the sun he is said to be blinded,—if a creature cannot look upon a creature without deceit
and offence, how can he without his own peril look upon the glittering face of the eternal
Creator, covered as he is with the clothing of this body? For who is justified in God’s sight,
when even the infant of one day cannot be pure from sin, and no one can boast of his integrity
and pureness of heart?”</p>

<head>Chapter 32 <del>XII.</del>—The Pelagian’s Heresy Arose Long After Ambrose.</head>
<p>It would be too long if I were to seek to mention everything which the holy Ambrose
said and wrote against this heresy of the Pelagians, which was to arise so long afterwards;
not indeed with a view to answer them, but with a view to declare the catholic faith, and to
build up men in it. Moreover, I neither could nor ought to mention all those things which
Cyprian, most glorious in the Lord, wrote in his letters, whereby it is shown how this which
we hold is the true and truly Christian and catholic faith, as it was delivered of old by the
Holy Scriptures, and so retained and kept by our fathers and even to this time, in which
these heretics have attempted to destroy it, and as it will hereafter by God’s good will be
retained and kept. For that these things and things of this kind were thus delivered to Cyprian,
and by Cyprian, is testified by the testimonies produced from his letters; and that thus
they were maintained up to our times is shown by these things which Ambrose wrote about
these matters before these heretics had begun to rage, and catholic ears had shuddered at
their profane novelties which are everywhere; and that thus, moreover, they shall be maintained
hereafter, was declared with sufficient vigour partly by the condemnation of such
opinions as these, partly by their correction. For whatever they may dare to mutter against
the sound faith of Cyprian and Ambrose, I do not think that they will break out into such
a madness as to dare to call those noted and memorable men of God, Manicheans.</p>

<p>What is it, then, which in their raging blindness of mind they are now spreading
about,2913 “that almost throughout the entire West a dogma not less foolish than impious
is taken up;” when by the mercy of God and by His merciful governance of His Church, the
catholic faith has been so watchful that the dogma, “not less foolish than wicked,” as of the
Manicheans, so also of these heretics, should not be taken up? So holy and learned catholic
men, such as are attested to be so by the report of the whole Church, praise both God’s
creation, and marriage as ordained by Him, and the law given by Him by means of the holy
Moses, and the free will implanted into man’s nature, and the holy patriarchs and prophets,
with due and fitting proclamation; all which five things the Manicheans condemn, partly
by denying, and partly also by abominating. Whence it appears that these catholic doctors
were far removed from the notions of the Manicheans, and yet they assert original sin; they
assert God’s grace above free will, as antecedent to all merit, so as truly to afford a gratuitous
divine assistance; they assert that the saints lived righteously in this flesh, in such wise that
the help of prayer was necessary to them, by which their daily sins might be forgiven; and
that a perfected righteousness which could not have sin would be in another life the reward
of those who should live righteously here.</p>

of Heresies.</head>
<p>What is it, then, that they say, that “subscription was extorted from simple bishops sitting
in their places without any Synodal congregation”? Was subscription extorted against such
heretics as these from the most blessed and excellent men in the faith, Cyprian and Ambrose,
before such heretics as these were in existence?—seeing that they overthrow their impious
dogmas with such clearness that we can scarcely find anything more manifest to say against
them. Or, indeed, was there any need of the congregation of a Synod to condemn this open
pest, as if no heresy could at any time be condemned except by a Synodal congregation?—
when, on the contrary, very few heresies can be found for the sake of condemning
which any such necessity has arisen; and those have been many and incomparably more
which have deserved to be accused and condemned in the place where they arose, and thence
could be known and avoided over the rest of the lands. But the pride of such as these, which
lifts itself up so much against God as not to be willing to glory in Him but rather in free will,
is understood as grasping also at this glory, that a Synod of the East and West should be
gathered together on their account. In fact, they endeavour, forsooth, to disturb the catholic
world, because, the Lord being against them, they are unable to pervert it; when rather they
ought to have been trodden out wherever those wolves might have appeared, by watchfulness
and pastoral diligence, after a competent and sufficient judgment made concerning them;
whether with a view of their being healed and changed, or with a view of their being shunned
by the safety and soundness of others, by the help of the Shepherd of the sheep, who seeks
the lost sheep also among the little ones, who makes the sheep holy and righteous freely;
who both providently instructs them, although sanctified and justified, yet in their frailty
and infirmity to pray for a daily remission for their daily sins, without which no one lives
in this world, even although he may live well; and mercifully listens to their prayers.</p>

<pb n="1212"/>
<head>EXTRACT FROM AUGUSTIN’S “RETRACTATIONS,”
Book II. Chap. 66,
ON THE FOLLOWING TREATISE,
“DE GRATIA ET LIBERO ARBITRIO.”</head>
<p>There are some persons who suppose that the freedom of the will is denied whenever
God’s grace is maintained, and who on their side defend their liberty of will so peremptorily
as to deny the grace of God. This grace, as they assert, is bestowed according to our own
merits. It is in consequence of their opinions that I wrote the book entitled On Grace and
Free Will. This work I addressed to the monks of Adrumetum, 2914 in whose monastry first
arose the controversy on that subject, and that in such a manner that some of them were
obliged to consult me thereon. The work begins with these words: “With reference to those
persons who so preach the liberty of the human will.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2914 Adrumetum, a maritime city of Africa, was the metropolis of the Province of Byzacium, as Procopius
informs us, De Aedificiis Justiniani VI. It was in a monastery here that the monks resided for whose instruction
Augustin composed the two following treatises,—the former entitled De Gratiâ et Libero Arbitrio, and the latter
De Correptione et Gratiâ, in the year of Christ 426 or 427. In our opinion, no later date can be well assigned to
these writings, inasmuch as they are mentioned in The Retractations, which was published about the year 427;
nor can they be placed earlier in date, because they are in that work mentioned the very last.</note>

<head>Letter I.</head>
<p><del>The 214th of Augustin’s Epistles.</del></p>
<p>To my very dear lord and most honoured brother among the members of Christ, Valentinus,
and to the brethren that are with you, Augustin sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>1. Two young men, Cresconius and Felix, have found their way to us, and, introducing
themselves as belonging to your brotherhood, have told us that your monastery was disturbed
with no small commotion, because certain amongst you preach grace in such a manner as
to deny that the will of man is free; and maintain—a more serious matter—that in the day
of judgment God will not render to every man according to his works. 2916 At the same
time, they have pointed out to us, that many of you do not entertain this opinion, but allow
that free will is assisted by the grace of God, so as that we may think and do aright; so that,
when the Lord shall come to render unto every man according to his works,2917 He shall
find those works of ours good which God has prepared in order that we may walk in
them.2918 They who think this think rightly.</p>
<p>2. “I beseech you therefore, brethren,” even as the apostle besought the Corinthians,
“by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be
no divisions among you.” For, in the first place, the Lord Jesus, as it is written in the Gospel
of the Apostle John, “came not to condemn the world, but that the world by Himself might
be saved.”2919 Then, afterwards, as the Apostle Paul writes, “God shall judge the world2920
when He shall come,” as the whole Church confesses in the Creed, “to judge the quick and
the dead.” Now, I would ask, if there is no grace of God, how does He save the world? and
if there is no free will, how does He judge the world? That book of mine, therefore, or epistle,
which the above-mentioned brethren have brought with them to you, I wish you to understand
in accordance with this faith, so that you may neither deny God’s grace, nor uphold
free will in such wise as to separate the latter from the grace of God, as if without this we
could by any means either think or do anything according to God,—which is quite beyond
our power. On this account, indeed, it is, that the Lord when speaking of the fruits of
righteousness said, “Without me ye can do nothing.”2921</p>
<p>3. From this you may understand why I wrote the letter which has been referred to,2922
to Sixtus, presbyter of the Church at Rome, against the new Pelagian heretics, who say that
<note type="footnote">2916 See Matt. xvi. 17, and Rom. ii. 6.</note>

<pb n="1215"/>
the grace of God is bestowed according to our own merits, so that he who glories has to
glory not in the Lord, but in himself,—that is to say, in man, not in the Lord. This, however,
the apostle forbids in these words: “Let no man glory in man;”2923 while in another passage
he says, “He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.”2924 But these heretics, under the idea
that they are justified by their own selves, just as if God did not bestow on them this gift,
but they themselves obtained it by themselves, glory of course in themselves, and not in the
Lord. Now, the apostle says to such, “Who maketh thee to differ from another?”2925 and
this he does on the ground that out of the mass of perdition which arose from Adam, none
but God distinguishes a man to make him a vessel to honour, and not to dishonour.2926
Lest, however, the carnal man in his foolish pride should, on hearing the question, “Who
maketh thee to differ from another?” either in thought or in word answer and say: My faith,
or my prayer, or my righteousness makes me to differ from other men, the apostle at once
adds these words to the question, and so meets all such notions, saying, “What hast thou
that thou didst not receive? now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou didst
not receive it?”2927 Now, they boast as if they did not receive their gifts by grace, who think
that they are justified of their own selves, and who, on this account, glory in themselves,
and not in the Lord.</p>
<p>4. Therefore I have in this letter, which has reached you, shown by passages of Holy
Scripture, which you can examine for yourselves, that our good works and pious prayers
and right faith could not possibly have been in us unless we had received them all from Him,
concerning whom the Apostle James says, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.”2928 And so no man can say that it is by
the merit of his own works, or by the merit of his own prayers, or by the merit of his own
faith, that God’s grace has been conferred upon him; nor suppose that the doctrine is true
which those heretics hold, that the grace of God is given us in proportion to our own merit.
This is altogether a most erroneous opinion; not, indeed, because there is no desert, good
in pious persons, or evil in impious ones (for how else shall God judge the world?),2929 but
because a man is converted by that mercy and grace of God, of which the Psalmist says, “As
for my God, His mercy shall prevent me;”2930 so that the unrighteous man is justified, that

<p>5. There were many things which I wanted to send you, by the perusal whereof you
would have been able to gain a more exact and full knowledge of all that has been done by
the bishops in their councils against these Pelagian heretics. But the brethren were in haste
who came to us from your company. By them we have sent you this letter; which is, however,
not an answer to any communication, because, in truth, they brought us no epistle from
your beloved selves. Yet we had no hesitation in receiving them; for their simple manners
proved to us clearly enough that there could have been nothing unreal or deceptive in their
visit to us. They were, however, in much haste, as wishing to spend Easter at home with
you; and my earnest prayer is, that so sacred a day may, by the Lord’s help, bring peace to
you, and not dissension.</p>
<p>6. You will, indeed, take the better course (as I earnestly request you), if you will not
refuse to send to me the very person by whom they say they have been disturbed. For either
he does not understand my book, or else, perhaps, he is himself misunderstood, when he
endeavours to solve and explain a question which is a very difficult one, and intelligible to
few. For it is none other than the question of God’s grace which has caused persons of no
understanding to think that the Apostle Paul prescribes it to us as a rule, “Let us do evil that
good may come.”2931 It is in reference to these that the Apostle Peter writes in his second
Epistle; “Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent, that ye may be
found of Him in peace, without spot and blameless and account that the long-suffering of
our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given
unto him, hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things:
in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable
wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, unto their own destruction.”2932</p>
<p>7. Take good heed, then, to these fearful words of the great apostle; and when you feel
that you do not understand, put your faith in the meanwhile in the inspired word of God,
and believe both that man’s will is free, and that there is also God’s grace, without whose
help man’s free will can neither be turned towards God, nor make any progress in God. And
what you piously believe, that pray that you may have a wise understanding of. And, indeed,
it is for this very purpose,—that is, that we may have a wise understanding, that there is a
free will. For unless we understood and were wise with a free will, it would not be enjoined
to us in the words of Scripture, “Understand now, ye simple among the people; and ye fools,
at length be wise.”2933 The very precept and injunction which calls on us to be intelligent
<note type="footnote">2931 Rom. iii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">2932 2 Pet. iii. 14–16.</note>
<note type="footnote">2933 Ps. xciv. 8.</note>

<pb n="1217"/>
and wise, requires also our obedience; and we could exercise no obedience without free will.
But if it were in our power to obey this precept to be understanding and wise by free will,
without the help of God’s grace, it would be unnecessary to say to God, “Give me understanding,
that I may learn Thy commandments;”2934 nor would it have been written in the
gospel, “Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures;”2935
nor should the Apostle James address us in such words as, “If any of you lack wisdom, let
him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
him.”2936 But the Lord is able to grant, both to you and to us, that we may rejoice over very
speedy tidings of your peace and pious unanimity. I send you greeting, not in my own name
only, but of the brethren also who are with me; and I ask you to pray for us with one accord
and with all earnestness. The Lord be with you.</p>

<head>Letter II.</head>
<p><del>The 215th of Augustin’s Epistles.</del></p>
<p>To my very dear lord and most honoured brother among the members of Christ, Valentinus,
and to the brethren that are with you, Augustin sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>1. That Cresconius and Felix, and another Felix, the servants of God, who came to us
from your brotherhood, have spent Easter with us is known to your Love.2937 We have detained
them somewhile longer in order that they might return to you better instructed
against the new Pelagian heretics, into whose error every one falls who supposes that it is
according to any human merits that the grace of God is given to us, which alone delivers a
man through Jesus Christ our Lord. But he, too, is no less in error who thinks that, when
the Lord shall come to judgment, a man is not judged according to his works who has been
able to use throughout his life free choice of will. For only infants, who have not yet done
any works of their own, either good or bad, will be condemned on account of original sin
alone, when they have not been delivered by the Saviour’s grace in the laver of regeneration.
As for all others who, in the use of their free will, have added to original sin, sins of their
own commission, but who have not been delivered by God’s grace from the power of
darkness and removed into the kingdom of Christ, they will receive judgment according to
the deserts not of their original sin only, but also of the acts of their own will. The good,
indeed, shall receive their reward according to the merits of their own good-will, but then
they received this very good-will through the grace of God; and thus is accomplished that
sentence of Scripture, “Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of
man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile: but glory, honour, and peace
to every man that worketh good; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.”2938</p>
<p>2. Touching the very difficult question of will and grace, I have felt no need of treating
it further in this letter, having given them another letter also when they were about to return
in greater haste. I have written a book likewise for you,2939 and if you, by the Lord’s help,
read it, and have a lively understanding of it, I think that no further dissension on this subject
will arise among you. They take with them other documents besides, which, as we supposed,
ought to be sent to you, in order that from these you may ascertain what means the catholic
Church has adopted for repelling, in God’s mercy, the poison of the Pelagian heresy. For
the letters to Pope Innocent, Bishop of Rome, from the Council of the province of Carthage,
and from the Council of Numidia, and one written with exceeding care by five bishops, and
<note type="footnote">2937 The phrase of Christian salutation, vestra caritas which may be rendered “your loving or beloved selves;”
it is a parallel phrase with the more familiar one to modern ears, “Your Honour.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2938 Rom. ii. 8, 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2939 The following treatise is here referred to,—On Grace and Free Will.</note>

<pb n="1219"/>
what he wrote back to these three; our letter also to Pope Zosimus about the African
Council, and his answer addressed to all bishops throughout the world; and a brief constitution,
which we drew up against the error itself at a later plenary Council of all Africa; and
the above-mentioned book of mine, which I have just written for you,—all these we have
both read over with them, while they were with us, and have now despatched by their hands
to you.2940</p>
<p>3. Furthermore, we have read to them the work of the most blessed martyr Cyprian on
the Lord’s Prayer, and have pointed out to them how He taught that all things pertaining
to our morals, which constitute right living, must be sought from our Father which is in
heaven, lest, by presuming on free will, we fall from divine grace. From the same treatise
we have also shown them how the same glorious martyr has taught us that it behoves us to
pray even for our enemies who have not yet believed in Christ, that they may believe; which
would of course be all in vain unless the Church believed that even the evil and unbelieving
wills of men might, by the grace of God, be converted to good. This book of St. Cyprian,
however, we have not sent you, because they told us that you possessed it among yourselves
already. My letter, also, which had been sent to Sixtus, presbyter of the Church at Rome2941
and which they brought with them to us, we read over with them, and pointed out how that
it had been written in opposition to those who say that God’s grace is bestowed according
to our merits,—that is to say, in opposition to the same Pelagians.</p>
<p>4. As far, then, as lay in our power, we have used our influence with them, as both your
brethren and our own, with a view to their persevering in the soundness of the catholic faith,
which neither denies free will whether for an evil or a good life, nor attributes to it so much
power that it can avail anything without God’s grace, whether that it may be changed from
evil to good, or that it may persevere in the pursuit of good, or that it may attain to eternal
good when there is no further fear of failure. To yourselves, too, my most dearly beloved, I
also, in this letter, give the same exhortation which the apostle addresses to us all, “not to
think of yourselves more highly than you ought to think; but to think soberly, according as
God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”2942</p>
<p>5. Mark well the counsel which the Holy Ghost gives us by Solomon: “Make straight
paths for thy feet, and order thy ways aright. Turn not aside to the right hand nor to the
left, but turn away thy foot from the evil way; for the Lord knoweth the ways on the right
hand, but those on the left are perverse. He will make thy ways straight, and will direct thy
steps in peace.”2943 Now consider, my brethren, that in these words of Holy Scripture, if
<note type="footnote">2940 See Epp. 175–177, and 181–183.</note>
<note type="footnote">2941 Ep. 194.</note>
<note type="footnote">2942 Rom. xii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">2943 Prov. iv. 26, 27.</note>

<pb n="1220"/>
there were no free will, it would not be said, “Make straight paths for thy feet, and order thy
ways; turn not aside to the right hand, nor to the left.” Nor yet, were this possible for us to
achieve without the grace of God, would it be afterwards added, “He will make thy ways
straight, and will direct thy steps in peace.”</p>
<p>6. Decline, therefore, neither to the right hand nor to the left, although the paths on the
right hand are praised, and those on the left hand are blamed. This is why he added, “Turn
away thy foot from the evil way,”—that is, from the left-hand path. This he makes manifest
in the following words, saying, “For the Lord knoweth the ways on the right hand; but those
on the left are perverse.” In those ways we ought surely to walk which the Lord knows; and
it is of these that we read in the Psalm, “The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the
way of the ungodly shall perish;”2944 for this way, which is on the left hand, the Lord does
not know. As He will also say at last to such as are placed on His left hand at the day of
judgment: “I know you not.”2945 Now what is that which He knows not, who knows all
things, both good and evil, in man? But what is the meaning of the words, “I know you not,”
unless it be that you are now such as I never made you? Precisely as that passage runs, which
is spoken of the Lord Jesus Christ, that “He knew no sin.”2946 How knew it not, except that
He had never made it? And, therefore, how is to be understood the passage, “The ways
which are on the right hand the Lord knoweth,” except in the sense that He made those
ways Himself,—even “the paths of the righteous,” which no doubt are “those good works
that God,” as the apostle tells us, “hath before ordained that we should walk in them”?2947
Whereas the left-hand ways—those perverse paths of the unrighteous—He truly knows
nothing of, because He never made them for man, but man made them for himself.
Wherefore He says, “The perverse ways of the wicked I utterly abhor; they are on the left
hand.”</p>
<p>7. But the reply is made: Why did He say, “Turn not aside to the right hand, nor to the
left,” when he clearly ought rather to have said, Keep to the right hand, and turn not off to
the left, if the right-hand paths are good? Why, do we think, except this, that the paths on
the right hand are so good that it is not good to turn off from them, even to the right? For
that man, indeed, is to be understood as declining to the right who chooses to attribute to
himself, and not to God, even those good works which appertain to right-hand ways. Hence
it was that after saying, “For the Lord knoweth the ways on the right hand, but those on the
left hand are perverse,” as if the objection were raised to Him, Wherefore, then, do you not
wish us to turn aside to the right? He immediately added as follows: “He will Himself make
<note type="footnote">2944 Ps. i. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">2945 Matt. vii. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">2946 2 Cor. v. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">2947 Eph. ii. 10.</note>

<pb n="1221"/>
thy paths straight, and will direct thy ways in peace.” Understand, therefore, the precept,
“Make straight paths for thy feet, and order thy ways aright,” in such a sense as to know that
whenever you do all this, it is the Lord God who enables you to do it. Then you will not turn
off to the right, although you are walking in right-hand paths, not trusting in your own
strength; and He will Himself be your strength, who will make straight paths for your feet,
and will direct your ways in peace.</p>
<p>8. Wherefore, most dearly beloved, whosoever says, My will suffices for me to perform
good works, declines to the right. But, on the other hand, they who think that a good way
of life should be forsaken, when they hear God’s grace so preached as to lead to the supposition
and belief that it of itself makes men’s wills from evil to good, and it even of itself keeps
them what it has made them; and who, as the result of this opinion, go on to say, “Let us do
evil that good may come,”2948—these persons decline to the left. This is the reason why he
said to you, “Turn not aside to the right hand, nor to the left;” in other words, do not uphold
free will in such wise as to attribute good works to it without the grace of God, nor so defend
and maintain grace as if, by reason of it, you may love evil works in security and
safety,—which may God’s grace itself avert from you! Now it was the words of such as these
which the apostle had in view when he said, “What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in
sin that grace may abound?”2949 And to this cavil of erring men, who know nothing about
the grace of God, he returned such an answer as he ought in these words: “God forbid. How
shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?” Nothing could have been said more
succinctly, and yet to the point. For what more useful gift does the grace of God confer upon
us, in this present evil world, than our dying unto sin? Hence he shows himself ungrateful
to grace itself who chooses to live in sin by reason of that whereby we die unto sin. May
God, however, who is rich in mercy, grant you both to think soundly and wisely, and to
continue perseveringly and progressively to the end in every good determination and purpose.
For yourselves, for us, for all who love you, and for those who hate you, pray that this gift
may be attained,—pray earnestly and vigilantly in brotherly peace. Live unto God. If I deserve
any favour at your hands, let brother Florus come to me.</p>

<head>A TREATISE ON GRACE AND FREE WILL,
BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;</head>
<p>addressed to valentinus and the monks of adrumetum, and completed in one
book.</p>
<p>written in a.d. 426 or a.d. 427</p>
<p>In this treatise Augustin teaches us to beware of maintaining grace by denying free will, or
free will by denying grace; for that it is evident from the testimony of Scripture that there
is in man a free choice of will; and there are also in the same Scriptures inspired proofs
given of that very grace of God without which we can do nothing good. Afterwards, in
opposition to the Pelagians, he proves that grace is not bestowed according to our merits.
He explains how eternal life, which is rendered to good works, is really of grace. He then
goes on to show that the grace which is given to us through our Lord Jesus Christ is neither
the knowledge of the law, nor nature, nor simply remission of sins; but that it is grace that
makes us fulfil the law, and causes nature to be liberated from the dominion of sin. He
demolishes that vain subterfuge of the Pelagians, to the effect that “grace, although it is
not bestowed according to the merits of good works, is yet given according to the merits
of the antecedent good-will of the man who believes and prays.” He incidentally touches
the question, why God commands what He means Himself to give, and whether He imposes
on us any commands which we are unable to perform. He clearly shows that the love
which is indispensable for fulfilling the commandments is only within us from God Himself.
He points out that God works in men’s hearts to incline their wills whithersoever He willeth,
either to good works according to His mercy, or to evil ones in return for their deserving;
His judgment, indeed, being sometimes manifest, sometimes hidden, but always righteous.
Lastly, he teaches us that a clear example of the gratuitousness of grace, not given in return
for our deserts, is supplied to us in the case of those infants which are saved, while others
perish though their case is identical with that of the rest.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—The Occasion and Argument of This Work.</head>
<p>With reference to those persons who so preach and defend man’s free will, as boldly to
deny, and endeavour to do away with, the grace of God which calls us to Him, and delivers
us from our evil deserts, and by which we obtain the good deserts which lead to everlasting
life: we have already said a good deal in discussion, and committed it to writing, so far as
the Lord has vouchsafed to enable us. But since there are some persons who so defend God’s
grace as to deny man’s free will, or who suppose that free will is denied when grace is defended,
I have determined to write somewhat on this point to your Love,2950 my brother
Valentinus, and the rest of you, who are serving God together under the impulse of a mutual
love. For it has been told me concerning you, brethren, by some members of your brotherhood
who have visited us, and are the bearers of this communication of ours to you, that
there are dissensions among you on this subject. This, then, being the case, dearly beloved,
that you be not disturbed by the obscurity of this question, I counsel you first to thank God
for such things as you understand; but as for all which is beyond the reach of your mind,
pray for understanding from the Lord, observing, at the same time peace and love among
yourselves; and until He Himself lead you to perceive what at present is beyond your comprehension,
walk firmly on the ground of which you are sure. This is the advice of the Apostle
Paul, who, after saying that he was not yet perfect,2951 a little later adds, “Let us, therefore,
as many as are perfect, be thus minded,”2952—meaning perfect to a certain extent, but not
having attained to a perfection sufficient for us; and then immediately adds, “And if, in any
thing, ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, whereunto
we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.”2953 For by walking in what we have
attained, we shall be able to advance to what we have not yet attained,—God revealing it to
us if in anything we are otherwise minded,—provided we do not give up what He has already
revealed.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—He Proves the Existence of Free Will in Man from the Precepts
Addressed to Him by God.</head>
<p>Now He has revealed to us, through His Holy Scriptures, that there is in a man a free
choice of will. But how He has revealed this I do not recount in human language, but in divine.
There is, to begin with, the fact that God’s precepts themselves would be of no use to
a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by performing them he might obtain the
promised rewards. For they are given that no one might be able to plead the excuse of ignorance,
as the Lord says concerning the Jews in the gospel: “If I had not come and spoken
unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.”2954 Of what
sin does He speak but of that great one which He foreknew, while speaking thus, that they
would make their own—that is, the death they were going to inflict upon Him? For they
did not have “no sin” before Christ came to them in the flesh. The apostle also says: “The
wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
who hold back the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is
manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him are
from the creation of the world clearly seen—being understood by the things that are
made—even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are inexcusable.”2955 In what
sense does he pronounce them to be “inexcusable,” except with reference to such excuse as
human pride is apt to allege in such words as, “If I had only known, I would have done it;
did I not fail to do it because I was ignorant of it?” or, “I would do it if I knew how; but I do
not know, therefore I do not do it”? All such excuse is removed from them when the precept
is given them, or the knowledge is made manifest to them how to avoid sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Sinners are Convicted When Attempting to Excuse Themselves by
Blaming God, Because They Have Free Will.</head>
<p>There are, however, persons who attempt to find excuse for themselves even from God.
The Apostle James says to such: “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God;
for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any man. But every man is
tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then, when lust hath conceived,
it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.”2956 Solomon, too,
in his book of Proverbs, has this answer for such as wish to find an excuse for themselves
from God Himself: “The folly of a man spoils his ways; but he blames God in his heart.”2957
And in the book of Ecclesiasticus we read: “Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell
away; for thou oughtest not to do the things that He hateth: nor do thou say, He hath caused
me to err; for He hath no need of the sinful man. The Lord hateth all abomination, and they
that fear God love it not. He Himself made man from the beginning, and left him in the
hand of His counsel. If thou be willing, thou shalt keep His commandments, and perform
true fidelity. He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thine hand unto whether
thou wilt. Before man is life and death, and whichsoever pleaseth him shall be given to
him.”2958 Observe how very plainly is set before our view the free choice of the human will.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—The Divine Commands Which are Most Suited to the Will Itself Illustrate
Its Freedom.</head>
<p>What is the import of the fact that in so many passages God requires all His commandments
to be kept and fulfilled? How does He make this requisition, if there is no free will?
What means “the happy man,” of whom the Psalmist says that “his will has been the law of
the Lord”?2959 Does he not clearly enough show that a man by his own will takes his stand
in the law of God? Then again, there are so many commandments which in some way are
expressly adapted to the human will; for instance, there is, “Be not overcome of evil,”2960
and others of similar import, such as, “Be not like a horse or a mule, which have no understanding;”
2961 and, “Reject not the counsels of thy mother;”2962 and, “Be not wise in thine
own conceit;”2963 and, “Despise not the chastening of the Lord;”2964 and, “Forget not my
law;”2965 and, “Forbear not to do good to the poor;”2966 and, “Devise not evil against thy
friend;”2967 and, “Give no heed to a worthless woman;”2968 and, “He is not inclined to understand
how to do good;”2969 and, “They refused to attend to my counsel;”2970 with
numberless other passages of the inspired Scriptures of the Old Testament. And what do
they all show us but the free choice of the human will? So, again, in the evangelical and
apostolic books of the New Testament what other lesson is taught us? As when it is said,
“Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth;”2971 and, “Fear not them which kill the
body;”2972 and, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself;”2973 and again, “Peace
on earth to men of good will.”2974 So also that the Apostle Paul says: “Let him do what he

no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will
keep his virgin, doeth well.”2975 And so again, “If I do this willingly, I have a reward;”2976
while in another passage he says, “Be ye sober and righteous, and sin not;”2977 and again,
“As ye have a readiness to will, so also let there be a prompt performance;”2978 then he remarks
to Timothy about the younger widows, “When they have begun to wax wanton against
Christ, they choose to marry.” So in another passage, “All that will to live godly in Christ
Jesus shall suffer persecution;”2979 while to Timothy himself he says, “Neglect not the gift
that is in thee.”2980 Then to Philemon he addresses this explanation: “That thy benefit should
not be as it were of necessity, but of thine own will.”2981 Servants also he advises to obey
their masters “with a good will.”2982 In strict accordance with this, James says: “Do not err,
my beloved brethren . . . and have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to
persons;”2983 and, “Do not speak evil one of another.”2984 So also John in his Epistle writes,
“Do not love the world,”2985 and other things of the same import. Now wherever it is said,
“Do not do this,” and “Do not do that,” and wherever there is any requirement in the divine
admonitions for the work of the will to do anything, or to refrain from doing anything, there
is at once a sufficient proof of free will. No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart
blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all
from a man’s own will when he performs any act in accordance with God. Indeed, a work
is then to be pronounced a good one when a person does it willingly; then, too, may the reward
of a good work be hoped for from Him concerning whom it is written, “He shall reward
every man according to his works.”2986</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—He Shows that Ignorance Affords No Such Excuse as Shall Free the
Offender from Punishment; But that to Sin with Knowledge is a Graver Thing
Than to Sin in Ignorance.</head>
<p>The excuse such as men are in the habit of alleging from ignorance is taken away from
those persons who know God’s commandments. But neither will those be without punishment
who know not the law of God. “For as many as have sinned without law shall also
perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.”2987
Now the apostle does not appear to me to have said this as if he meant that they would have
to suffer something worse who in their sins are ignorant of the law than they who know it.
[III.] It is seemingly worse, no doubt, “to perish” than “to be judged;” but inasmuch as he
was speaking of the Gentiles and of the Jews when he used these words, because the former
were without the law, but the latter had received the law, who can venture to say that the
Jews who sin in the law will not perish, since they refused to believe in Christ, when it was
of them that the apostle said, “They shall be judged by the law”? For without faith in Christ
no man can be delivered; and therefore they will be so judged that they perish. If, indeed,
the condition of those who are ignorant of the law of God is worse than the condition of
those who know it, how can that be true which the Lord says in the gospel: “The servant
who knows not his lord’s will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with
few stripes; whereas the servant who knows his lord’s will, and commits things worthy of
stripes, shall be beaten with many stripes”?2988 Observe how clearly He here shows that it
is a graver matter for a man to sin with knowledge than in ignorance. And yet we must not
on this account betake ourselves for refuge to the shades of ignorance, with the view of
finding our excuse therein. It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling
to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, “He is not inclined
to understand, so as to do good.”2989 But even the ignorance, which is not theirs who refuse
to know, but theirs who are, as it were, simply ignorant, does not so far excuse any one as
to exempt him from the punishment of eternal fire, though his failure to believe has been
the result of his not having at all heard what he should believe; but probably only so far as
to mitigate his punishment. For it was not said without reason: “Pour out Thy wrath upon
the heathen that have not known Thee;” 2990 nor again according to what the apostle says:
“When He shall come from heaven in a flame of fire to take vengeance on them that know
not God.”2991 But yet in order that we may have that knowledge that will prevent our saying,

each one of us, “I did not know,” “I did not hear,” “I did not understand;” the human will

have no understanding;”2992 although it may show itself even worse, of which it is written,
“A stubborn servant will not be reproved by words; for even if he understand, yet he will
not obey.”2993 But when a man says, “I cannot do what I am commanded, because I am
mastered by my concupiscence,” he has no longer any excuse to plead from ignorance, nor
reason to blame God in his heart, but he recognises and laments his own evil in himself;
and still to such an one the apostle says: “Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with
good;”2994 and of course the very fact that the injunction, “Consent not to be overcome,”
is addressed to him, undoubtedly summons the determination of his will. For to consent
and to refuse are functions proper to will.</p>

<head>Chapter 6 <del>IV.</del>—God’s Grace to Be Maintained Against the Pelagians; The Pelagian
Heresy Not an Old One.</head>
<p>It is, however, to be feared lest all these and similar testimonies of Holy Scripture (and
undoubtedly there are a great many of them), in the maintenance of free will, be understood
in such a way as to leave no room for God’s assistance and grace in leading a godly life and
a good conversation, to which the eternal reward is due; and lest poor wretched man, when
he leads a good life and performs good works (or rather thinks that he leads a good life and
performs good works), should dare to glory in himself and not in the Lord, and to put his
hope of righteous living in himself alone; so as to be followed by the prophet Jeremiah’s
malediction when he says, “Cursed is the man who has hope in man, and maketh strong
the flesh of his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.”2995 Understand, my brethren,
I pray you, this passage of the prophet. Because the prophet did not say, “Cursed is the man
who has hope in his own self,” it might seem to some that the passage, “Cursed is the man
who has hope in man,” was spoken to prevent man having hope in any other man but
himself. In order, therefore, to show that his admonition to man was not to have hope in
himself, after saying, “Cursed is the man who has hope in man,” he immediately added,
“And maketh strong the flesh of his arm.” He used the word “arm” to designate power in
operation. By the term “flesh,” however, must be understood human frailty. And therefore
he makes strong the flesh of his arm who supposes that a power which is frail and weak
(that is, human) is sufficient for him to perform good works, and therefore puts not his
hope in God for help. This is the reason why he subjoined the further clause, “And whose
heart departeth from the Lord.” Of this character is the Pelagian heresy, which is not an
ancient one, but has only lately come into existence. Against this system of error there was
first a good deal of discussion; then, as the ultimate resource, it was referred to sundry
episcopal councils, the proceedings of which, not, indeed, in every instance, but in some, I
have despatched to you for your perusal. In order, then, to our performance of good works,
let us not have hope in man, making strong the flesh of our arm; nor let our heart ever depart
from the Lord, but let it say to him, “Be Thou my helper; forsake me not, nor despise me,
O God of my salvation.”2996</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Grace is Necessary Along with Free Will to Lead a Good Life.</head>
<p>Therefore, my dearly beloved, as we have now proved by our former testimonies from
Holy Scripture that there is in man a free determination of will for living rightly and acting
rightly; so now let us see what are the divine testimonies concerning the grace of God,
without which we are not able to do any good thing. And first of all, I will say something
about the very profession which you make in your brotherhood. Now your society, in which
you are leading lives of continence, could not hold together unless you despised conjugal
pleasure. Well, the Lord was one day conversing on this very topic, when His disciples remarked
to Him, “If such be the case of a man with his wife, it is not good to marry.” He then
answered them, “All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.”2997 And
was it not to Timothy’s free will that the apostle appealed, when he exhorted him in these
words: “Keep thyself continent”?2998 He also explained the power of the will in this matter
when He said, “Having no necessity, but possessing power over his own will, to keep his
virgin.”2999 And yet “all men do not receive this saying, except those to whom the power is
given.” Now they to whom this is not given either are unwilling or do not fulfil what they
will; whereas they to whom it is given so will as to accomplish what they will. In order,
therefore, that this saying, which is not received by all men, may yet be received by some,
there are both the gift of God and free will.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Conjugal Chastity is Itself the Gift of God.</head>
<p>It is concerning conjugal chastity itself that the apostle treats, when he says, “Let him
do what he will, he sinneth not if he marry;”3000 and yet this too is God’s gift, for the
Scripture says, “It is by the Lord that the woman is joined to her husband.” Accordingly the
teacher of the Gentiles, in one of his discourses, commends both conjugal chastity, whereby
adulteries are prevented, and the still more perfect continence which foregoes all cohabitation,
and shows how both one and the other are severally the gift of God. Writing to the Corinthians,
he admonished married persons not to defraud each other; and then, after his admonition
to these, he added: “But I could wish that all men were even as I am myself,”3001—meaning,
of course, that he abstained from all cohabitation; and then proceeded to say: “But every
man hath his own gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.”3002 Now, do
the many precepts which are written in the law of God, forbidding all fornication and
adultery, indicate anything else than free will? Surely such precepts would not be given unless
a man had a will of his own, wherewith to obey the divine commandments. And yet it is
God’s gift which is indispensable for the observance of the precepts of chastity. Accordingly,
it is said in the Book of Wisdom: “When I knew that no one could be continent, except God
gives it, then this became a point of wisdom to know whose gift it was.”3003 “Every man,”
however, “is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed”3004 not to observe
and keep these holy precepts of chastity. If he should say in respect of these commandments,
“I wish to keep them, but am mastered by my concupiscence,” then the Scripture responds
to his free will, as I have already said: “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
good.”3005 In order, however, that this victory may be gained, grace renders its help; and
were not this help given, then the law would be nothing but the strength of sin. For concupiscence
is increased and receives greater energies from the prohibition of the law, unless
the spirit of grace helps. This explains the statement of the great Teacher of the Gentiles,
when he says, “The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.”3006 See, then, I
pray you, whence originates this confession of weakness, when a man says, “I desire to keep
what the law commands, but am overcome by the strength of my concupiscence.” And when
his will is addressed, and it is said, “Be not overcome of evil,” of what avail is anything but
the succour of God’s grace to the accomplishment of the precept? This the apostle himself

afterwards stated; for after saying “The strength of sin is the law,” he immediately subjoined,
“But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.”3007 It
follows, then, that the victory in which sin is vanquished is nothing else than the gift of God,
who in this contest helps free will.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Entering into Temptation. Prayer is a Proof of Grace.</head>
<p>Wherefore, our Heavenly Master also says: “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
temptation.”3008 Let every man, therefore, when fighting against his own concupiscence,
pray that he enter not into temptation; that is, that he be not drawn aside and enticed by it.
But he does not enter into temptation if he conquers his evil concupiscence by good will.
And yet the determination of the human will is insufficient, unless the Lord grant it victory
in answer to prayer that it enter not into temptation. What, indeed, affords clearer evidence
of the grace of God than the acceptance of prayer in any petition? If our Saviour had only
said, “Watch that ye enter not into temptation,” He would appear to have done nothing
further than admonish man’s will; but since He added the words, “and pray,” He showed
that God helps us not to enter into temptation. It is to the free will of man that the words
are addressed: “My son, remove not thyself from the chastening of the Lord.”3009 And the
Lord said: “I have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not.”3010 So that a man is assisted
by grace, in order that his will may not be uselessly commanded.</p>

<head>Chapter 10 <del>V.</del>—Free Will and God’s Grace are Simultaneously Commended.</head>
<p>When God says, “Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you,”3011 one of these
clauses—that which invites our return to God—evidently belongs to our will; while the
other, which promises His return to us, belongs to His grace. Here, possibly, the Pelagians
think they have a justification for their opinion which they so prominently advance, that
God’s grace is given according to our merits. In the East, indeed, that is to say, in the province
of Palestine, in which is the city of Jerusalem, Pelagius, when examined in person by the
bishop, 3012 did not venture to affirm this. For it happened that among the objections which
were brought up against him, this in particular was objected, that he maintained that the
grace of God was given according to our merits,—an opinion which was so diverse from
catholic doctrine, and so hostile to the grace of Christ, that unless he had anathematized it,
as laid to his charge, he himself must have been anathematized on its account. He pronounced,
indeed, the required anathema upon the dogma, but how insincerely his later
books plainly show; for in them he maintains absolutely no other opinion than that the
grace of God is given according to our merits. Such passages do they collect out of the
Scriptures,—like the one which I just now quoted, “Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto
you,”—as if it were owing to the merit of our turning to God that His grace were given us,
wherein He Himself even turns unto us. Now the persons who hold this opinion fail to observe
that, unless our turning to God were itself God’s gift, it would not be said to Him in
prayer, “Turn us again, O God of hosts;”3013 and, “Thou, O God, wilt turn and quicken
us;”3014 and again, “Turn us, O God of our salvation,”3015—with other passages of similar
import, too numerous to mention here. For, with respect to our coming unto Christ, what
else does it mean than our being turned to Him by believing? And yet He says: “No man
can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.”3016</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Other Passages of Scripture Which the Pelagians Abuse.</head>
<p>Then, again, there is the Scripture contained in the second book of the Chronicles: “The
Lord is with you when ye are with Him: and if ye shall seek Him ye shall find Him; but if ye
forsake Him, He also will forsake you.”3017 This passage, no doubt, clearly manifests the
choice of the will. But they who maintain that God’s grace is given according to our merits,
receive these testimonies of Scripture in such a manner as to believe that our merit lies in
the circumstance of our “being with God,” while His grace is given according to this merit,
so that He too may be with us. In like manner, that our merit lies in the fact of “our seeking
God,” and then His grace is given according to this merit, in order that we may find Him.”
Again, there is a passage in the first book of the same Chronicles which declares the choice
of the will: “And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him
with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth
all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee;
but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever.”3018 But these people find some room
for human merit in the clause, “If thou seek Him,” and then the grace is thought to be given
according to this merit in what is said in the ensuing words, “He will be found of thee.” And
so they labour with all their might to show that God’s grace is given according to our merits,—
in other words, that grace is not grace. For, as the apostle most expressly says, to them
who receive reward according to merit “the recompense is not reckoned of grace but of
debt.”3019</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—He Proves Out of St. Paul that Grace is Not Given According to Men’s
Merits.</head>
<p>Now there was, no doubt, a decided merit in the Apostle Paul, but it was an evil one,
while he persecuted the Church, and he says of it: “I am not meet to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the Church of God.”3020 And it was while he had this evil merit that
a good one was rendered to him instead of the evil; and, therefore, he went on at once to
say, “But by the grace of God I am what I am.”3021 Then, in order to exhibit also his free
will, he added in the next clause, “And His grace within me was not in vain, but I have laboured
more abundantly than they all.” This free will of man he appeals to in the case of
others also, as when he says to them, “We beseech you that ye receive not the grace of God
in vain.”3022 Now, how could he so enjoin them, if they received God’s grace in such a
manner as to lose their own will? Nevertheless, lest the will itself should be deemed capable
of doing any good thing without the grace of God, after saying, “His grace within me was
not in vain, but I have laboured more abundantly than they all,” he immediately added the
qualifying clause, “Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.”3023 In other words,
Not I alone, but the grace of God with me. And thus, neither was it the grace of God alone,
nor was it he himself alone, but it was the grace of God with him. For his call, however, from
heaven and his conversion by that great and most effectual call, God’s grace was alone, because
his merits, though great, were yet evil. Then, to quote one passage more, he says to
Timothy: “But be thou a co-labourer with the gospel, according to the power of God, who
saveth us and calleth us with His holy calling,—not according to our works but according
to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus.”3024 Then, elsewhere,
he enumerates his merits, and gives us this description of their evil character: “For we
ourselves also were formerly foolish, unbelieving, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.”3025 Nothing, to be sure, but
punishment was due to such a course of evil desert! God, however, who returns good for
evil by His grace, which is not given according to our merits, enabled the apostle to conclude
his statement and say: “But when the kindness and love of our Saviour God shone upon
us,—not of works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He
saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Ghost, whom He shed upon

<head>Chapter 13 <del>VI.</del>—The Grace of God is Not Given According to Merit, But Itself
Makes All Good Desert.</head>
<p>From these and similar passages of Scripture, we gather the proof that God’s grace is
not given according to our merits. The truth is, we see that it is given not only where there
are no good, but even where there are many evil merits preceding: and we see it so given
daily. But it is plain that when it has been given, also our good merits begin to be,—yet only
by means of it; for, were that only to withdraw itself, man falls, not raised up, but precipitated
by free will. Wherefore no man ought, even when he begins to possess good merits, to attribute
them to himself, but to God, who is thus addressed by the Psalmist: “Be Thou my helper,
forsake me not.”3027 By saying, “Forsake me not,” he shows that if he were to be forsaken,
he is unable of himself to do any good thing. Wherefore also he says: “I said in my abundance,
I shall never be moved,”3028 for he thought that he had such an abundance of good to call
his own that he would not be moved. But in order that he might be taught whose that was,
of which he had begun to boast as if it were his own, he was admonished by the gradual
desertion of God’s grace, and says: “O Lord, in Thy good pleasure Thou didst add strength
to my beauty. Thou didst, however, turn away Thy face, and then I was troubled and distressed.”
3029 Thus, it is necessary for a man that he should be not only justified when unrighteous
by the grace of God,—that is, be changed from unholiness to righteousness,—when
he is requited with good for his evil; but that, even after he has become justified by faith,
grace should accompany him on his way, and he should lean upon it, lest he fall. On this
account it is written concerning the Church herself in the book of Canticles: “Who is this
that cometh up in white raiment, leaning upon her kinsman?”3030 Made white is she who
by herself alone could not be white. And by whom has she been made white except by Him
who says by the prophet, “Though your sins be as purple, I will make them white as
snow”?3031 At the time, then, that she was made white, she deserved nothing good; but now
that she is made white, she walketh well;—but it is only by her continuing ever to lean upon
Him by whom she was made white. Wherefore, Jesus Himself, on whom she leans that was
made white, said to His disciples, “Without me ye can do nothing.”3032</p>

<p>Let us return now to the Apostle Paul, who, as we have found, obtained God’s grace,
who recompenses good for evil, without any good merits of his own, but rather with many
evil merits. Let us see what he says when his final sufferings were approaching, writing to
Timothy: “I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have
fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith.”3033 He enumerates
these as, of course, now his good merits; so that, as after his evil merits he obtained grace,
so now, after his good merits, he might receive the crown. Observe, therefore, what follows:
“There is henceforth laid up for me,” he says, “a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.”3034 Now, to whom should the righteous
Judge award the crown, except to him on whom the merciful Father had bestowed grace?
And how could the crown be one “of righteousness,” unless the grace had preceded which
“justifieth the ungodly”? How, moreover, could these things now be awarded as of debt,
unless the other had been before given as a free gift?</p>

end, that is, eternal life, is rendered to our preceding merits: they must not be allowed to go
without an answer. If, indeed, they so understand our merits as to acknowledge them, too,
to be the gifts of God, then their opinion would not deserve reprobation. But inasmuch as
they so preach human merits as to declare that a man has them of his own self, then most
rightly the apostle replies: “Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou,
that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst
not received it?”3035 To a man who holds such views, it is perfect truth to say: It is His own
gifts that God crowns, not your merits,—if, at least, your merits are of your own self, not of
Him. If, indeed, they are such, they are evil; and God does not crown them; but if they are
good, they are God’s gifts, because, as the Apostle James says, “Every good gift and every
perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.”3036 In accordance
with which John also, the Lord’s forerunner, declares: “A man can receive nothing except
it be given him from heaven”3037—from heaven, of course, because from thence came also
the Holy Ghost, when Jesus ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and gave gifts to
men.3038 If, then, your good merits are God’s gifts, God does not crown your merits as your
merits, but as His own gifts.</p>

<head>Chapter 16 <del>VII.</del>—Paul Fought, But God Gave the Victory: He Ran, But God Showed
Mercy.</head>
<p>Let us, therefore, consider those very merits of the Apostle Paul which he said the
Righteous Judge would recompense with the crown of righteousness; and let us see whether
these merits of his were really his own—I mean, whether they were obtained by him of
himself, or were the gifts of God. “I have fought,” says he, “the good fight; I have finished
my course; I have kept the faith.”3039 Now, in the first place, these good works were nothing,
unless they had been preceded by good thoughts. Observe, therefore, what he says concerning
these very thoughts. His words, when writing to the Corinthians, are: “Not that we are sufficient
of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.”3040
Then let us look at each several merit. “I have fought the good fight.” Well, now, I want to
know by what power he fought. Was it by a power which he possessed of himself, or by
strength given to him from above? It is impossible to suppose that so great a teacher as the
apostle was ignorant of the law of God, which proclaims the following in Deuteronomy:
“Say not in thine heart, My own strength and energy of hand hath wrought for me this great
power; but thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, how it is He that giveth thee strength to
acquire such power.”3041 And what avails “the good fight,” unless followed by victory? And
who gives the victory but He of whom the apostle says himself, “Thanks be to God, who
giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ”?3042 Then, in another passage, having
quoted from the Psalm these words: “Because for Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we
are accounted as sheep for slaughter,”3043 he went on to declare: “Nay, in all these things
we are more than conquerors, through Him that loved us.”3044 Not by ourselves, therefore,
is the victory accomplished, but by Him who hath loved us. In the second clause he says, “I
have finished my course.” Now, who is it that says this, but he who declares in another
passage, “So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.”3045 And this sentence can by no means be transposed, so that it could be
said: It is not of God, who showeth mercy, but of the man who willeth and runneth. If any
person be bold enough to express the matter thus, he shows himself most plainly to be at
issue with the apostle.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—The Faith that He Kept Was the Free Gift of God.</head>
<p>His last clause runs thus: “I have kept the faith.” But he who says this is the same who
declares in another passage, “I have obtained mercy that I might be faithful.”3046 He does
not say, “I obtained mercy because I was faithful,” but “in order that I might be faithful,”
thus showing that even faith itself cannot be had without God’s mercy, and that it is the gift
of God. This he very expressly teaches us when he says, “For by grace are ye saved through
faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.”3047 They might possibly say, “We received
grace because we believed;” as if they would attribute the faith to themselves, and the
grace to God. Therefore, the apostle having said, “Ye are saved through faith,” added,” And
that not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God.” And again, lest they should say they deserved
so great a gift by their works, he immediately added, “Not of works, lest any man should
boast.”3048 Not that he denied good works, or emptied them of their value, when he says
that God renders to every man according to his works;3049 but because works proceed from
faith, and not faith from works. Therefore it is from Him that we have works of righteousness,
from whom comes also faith itself, concerning which it is written, “The just shall live by
faith.”3050</p>

<p>Unintelligent persons, however, with regard to the apostle’s statement: “We conclude
that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law,”3051 have thought him to mean
that faith suffices to a man, even if he lead a bad life, and has no good works. Impossible is
it that such a character should be deemed “a vessel of election” by the apostle, who, after
declaring that “in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision,”
3052 adds at once, “but faith which worketh by love.” It is such faith which severs
God’s faithful from unclean demons,—for even these “believe and tremble,”3053 as the
Apostle James says; but they do not do well. Therefore they possess not the faith by which
the just man lives,—the faith which works by love in such wise, that God recompenses it
according to its works with eternal life. But inasmuch as we have even our good works from
God, from whom likewise comes our faith and our love, therefore the selfsame great teacher
of the Gentiles has designated “eternal life” itself as His gracious “gift.”3054</p>

<p>And hence there arises no small question, which must be solved by the Lord’s gift. If
eternal life is rendered to good works, as the Scripture most openly declares: “Then He shall
reward every man according to his works:”3055 how can eternal life be a matter of grace,
seeing that grace is not rendered to works, but is given gratuitously, as the apostle himself
tells us: “To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt;”3056 and
again: “There is a remnant saved according to the election of grace;” with these words immediately
subjoined: “And if of grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no
more grace”?3057 How, then, is eternal life by grace, when it is received from works? Does
the apostle perchance not say that eternal life is a grace? Nay, he has so called it, with a
clearness which none can possibly gainsay. It requires no acute intellect, but only an attentive
reader, to discover this. For after saying, “The wages of sin is death,” he at once added, “The
grace of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”3058</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—The Question Answered. Justification is Grace Simply and Entirely,
Eternal Life is Reward and Grace.</head>
<p>This question, then, seems to me to be by no means capable of solution, unless we understand
that even those good works of ours, which are recompensed with eternal life, belong
to the grace of God, because of what is said by the Lord Jesus: “Without me ye can do
nothing.”3059 And the apostle himself, after saying, “By grace are ye saved through faith;
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast;”3060
saw, of course, the possibility that men would think from this statement that good works
are not necessary to those who believe, but that faith alone suffices for them; and again, the
possibility of men’s boasting of their good works, as if they were of themselves capable of
performing them. To meet, therefore, these opinions on both sides, he immediately added,
“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath
before ordained that we should walk in them.”3061 What is the purport of his saying, “Not
of works, lest any man should boast,” while commending the grace of God? And then why
does he afterwards, when giving a reason for using such words, say, “For we are His workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus unto good works”? Why, therefore, does it run, “Not of
works, lest any man should boast”? Now, hear and understand. “Not of works” is spoken
of the works which you suppose have their origin in yourself alone; but you have to think
of works for which God has moulded (that is, has formed and created) you. For of these he
says, “We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.” Now he does
not here speak of that creation which made us human beings, but of that in reference to
which one said who was already in full manhood, “Create in me a clean heart, O God;”3062
concerning which also the apostle says, “Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new
creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are
of God.”3063 We are framed, therefore, that is, formed and created, “in the good works
which” we have not ourselves prepared, but “God hath before ordained that we should walk
in them.” It follows, then, dearly beloved, beyond all doubt, that as your good life is nothing
else than God’s grace, so also the eternal life which is the recompense of a good life is the
grace of God; moreover it is given gratuitously, even as that is given gratuitously to which
it is given. But that to which it is given is solely and simply grace; this therefore is also that
which is given to it, because it is its reward;—grace is for grace, as if remuneration for

<head>Chapter 21 <del>IX.</del>—Eternal Life is “Grace for Grace.”</head>
<p>Perhaps you ask whether we ever read in the Sacred Scriptures of “grace for grace.” Well
you possess the Gospel according to John, which is perfectly clear in its very great light.
Here John the Baptist says of Christ: “Of His fulness have we all received, even grace for
grace.”3065 So that out of His fulness we have received, according to our humble measure,
our particles of ability as it were for leading good lives—“according as God hath dealt to
every man his measure of faith;”3066 because “every man hath his proper gift of God; one
after this manner, and another after that.”3067 And this is grace. But, over and above this,
we shall also receive “grace for grace,” when we shall have awarded to us eternal life, of
which the apostle said: “The grace of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,”3068
having just said that “the wages of sin is death.” Deservedly did he call it “wages,” because
everlasting death is awarded as its proper due to diabolical service. Now, when it was in his
power to say, and rightly to say: “But the wages of righteousness is eternal life,” he yet preferred
to say: “The grace of God is eternal life;” in order that we may hence understand that
God does not, for any merits of our own, but from His own divine compassion, prolong
our existence to everlasting life. Even as the Psalmist says to his soul, “Who crowneth thee
with mercy and compassion.”3069 Well, now, is not a crown given as the reward of good
deeds? It is, however, only because He works good works in good men, of whom it is said,
“It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure,”3070 that the
Psalm has it, as just now quoted: “He crowneth thee with mercy and compassion,” since it
is through His mercy that we perform the good deeds to which the crown is awarded. It is
not, however, to be for a moment supposed, because he said, “It is God that worketh in you
both to will and to do of his own good pleasure,” that free will is taken away. If this, indeed,
had been his meaning, he would not have said just before, “Work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling.”3071 For when the command is given “to work,” their free will is
addressed; and when it is added, “with fear and trembling,” they are warned against boasting
of their good deeds as if they were their own, by attributing to themselves the performance
of anything good. It is pretty much as if the apostle had this question put to him: “Why did
you use the phrase, ‘with fear and trembling’?” And as if he answered the inquiry of his examiners
by telling them, “For it is God which worketh in you.” Because if you fear and

<head>Chapter 22 <del>X.</del>—Who is the Transgressor of the Law? The Oldness of Its Letter.
The Newness of Its Spirit.</head>
<p>Therefore, brethren, you ought by free will not do evil but do good; this, indeed, is the
lesson taught us in the law of God, in the Holy Scriptures—both Old and New. Let us,
however, read, and by the Lord’s help understand, what the apostle tells us: “Because by the
deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight; for by the law is the knowledge
of sin.”3072 Observe, he says “the knowledge,” not “the destruction,” of sin. But when a man
knows sin, and grace does not help him to avoid what he knows, undoubtedly the law works
wrath. And this the apostle explicitly says in another passage. His words are: “The law
worketh wrath.”3073 The reason of this statement lies in the fact that God’s wrath is greater
in the case of the transgressor who by the law knows sin, and yet commits it; such a man is
thus a transgressor of the law, even as the apostle says in another sentence, “For where no
law is, there is no transgression.”3074 It is in accordance with this principle that he elsewhere
says, “That we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter;”3075
wishing the law to be here understood by “the oldness of the letter,” and what else by
“newness of spirit” than grace? Then, that it might not be thought that he had brought any
accusation, or suggested any blame, against the law, he immediately takes himself to task
with this inquiry: “What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid.” He then adds the
statement: “Nay, I had not known sin but by the law;”3076 which is of the same import as
the passage above quoted: “By the law is the knowledge of sin.”3077 Then: “For I had not
known lust,” he says, “except the law had said, ‘Thou shalt not covet.’3078 But sin, taking
occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without
the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment
came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found
to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it
slew me. Wherefore the law is holy; and the commandment holy, just, and good. Was, then,
that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked
death in me by that which is good,—in order that the sinner, or3079 the sin, might by the

<head>Chapter 23 <del>XI.</del>—The Pelagians Maintain that the Law is the Grace of God Which
Helps Us Not to Sin.</head>
<p>Why, therefore, do those very vain and perverse Pelagians say that the law is the grace
of God by which we are helped not to sin? Do they not, by making such an allegation, unhappily
and beyond all doubt contradict the great apostle? He, indeed, says, that by the law
sin received strength against man; and that man, by the commandment, although it be holy,
and just, and good, nevertheless dies, and that death works in him through that which is
good, from which death there is no deliverance unless the Spirit quickens him, whom the
letter had killed,—as he says in another passage, “The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth
life.”3082 And yet these obstinate persons, blind to God’s light, and deaf to His voice,
maintain that the letter which kills gives life, and thus gainsay the quickening Spirit.
“Therefore, brethren” (that I may warn you with better effect in the words of the apostle
himself), “we are debtors not to the flesh, to live after the flesh; for if ye live after the flesh
ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.”3083
I have said this to deter your free will from evil, and to exhort it to good by apostolic words;
but yet you must not therefore glory in man,—that is to say, in your own selves,—and not
in the Lord, when you live not after the flesh, but through the Spirit mortify the deeds of
the flesh. For in order that they to whom the apostle addressed this language might not exalt
themselves, thinking that they were themselves able of their own spirit to do such good
works as these, and not by the Spirit of God, after saying to them, “If ye through the Spirit
do mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live,” he at once added, “For as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”3084 When, therefore, you by the Spirit mortify
the deeds of the flesh, that you may have life, glorify Him, praise Him, give thanks to Him
by whose Spirit you are so led as to be able to do such things as show you to be the children
of God; “for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”</p>

“God’s Righteousness,” So Called, Which Man Has from God.</head>
<p>As many, therefore, as are led by their own spirit, trusting in their own virtue, with the
addition merely of the law’s assistance, without the help of grace, are not the sons of God.
Such are they of whom the same apostle speaks as “being ignorant of God’s righteousness,
and wishing to establish their own righteousness, who have not submitted themselves to
the righteousness of God.”3085 He said this of the Jews, who in their self-assumption rejected
grace, and therefore did not believe in Christ. Their own righteousness, indeed, he says,
they wish to establish; and this righteousness is of the law,—not that the law was established
by themselves, but that they had constituted their righteousness in the law which is of God,
when they supposed themselves able to fulfil that law by their own strength, ignorant of
God’s righteousness,—not indeed that by which God is Himself righteous, but that which
man has from God. And that you may know that he designated as theirs the righteousness
which is of the law, and as God’s that which man receives from God, hear what he says in
another passage, when speaking of Christ: “For whose sake I counted all things not only as
loss, but I deemed them to be dung, that I might win Christ, and be found in Him—not
having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, which is of God.”3086 Now what does he mean by “not having my own righteousness,
which is of the law,” when the law is really not his at all, but God’s,—except this, that he
called it his own righteousness, although it was of the law, because he thought he could
fulfil the law by his own will, without the aid of grace which is through faith in Christ?
Wherefore, after saying, “Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law,” he immediately
subjoined, “But that which is through the faith of Christ, which is of God.” This is
what they were ignorant of, of whom he says, “Being ignorant of God’s righteousness,”—that
is, the righteousness which is of God (for it is given not by the letter, which kills, but by the
life-giving Spirit), “and wishing to establish their own righteousness,” which he expressly
described as the righteousness of the law, when he said, “Not having my own righteousness,
which is of the law;” they were not subject to the righteousness of God,—in other words,
they submitted not themselves to the grace of God. For they were under the law, not under
grace, and therefore sin had dominion over them, from which a man is not freed by the law,
but by grace. On which account he elsewhere says, “For sin shall not have dominion over
you; because ye are not under the law, but under grace.”3087 Not that the law is evil; but
because they are under its power, whom it makes guilty by imposing commandments, not
by aiding. It is by grace that any one is a doer of the law; and without this grace, he who is

by Which We are Christians.</head>
<p>Now who can be so insensible to the words of the apostle, who so foolishly, nay, so insanely
ignorant of the purport of his statement, as to venture to affirm that the law is grace,
when he who knew very well what he was saying emphatically declares, “Ye who are justified
by the law are fallen from grace”? Well, but if the law is not grace, seeing that in order that
the law itself may be kept, it is not the law, but only grace which can give help, will not nature
at any rate be grace? For this, too, the Pelagians have been bold enough to aver, that grace
is the nature in which we were created, so as to possess a rational mind, by which we are
enabled to understand,—formed as we are in the image of God, so as to have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth
upon the earth. This, however, is not the grace which the apostle commends to us through
the faith of Jesus Christ. For it is certain that we possess this nature in common with ungodly
men and unbelievers; whereas the grace which comes through the faith of Jesus Christ belongs
only to them to whom the faith itself appertains. “For all men have not faith.”3089 Now, as
the apostle, with perfect truth, says to those who by wishing to be justified by the law have
fallen from grace, “If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain;”3090 so
likewise, to those who think that the grace which he commends and faith in Christ receives,
is nature, the same language is with the same degree of truth applicable: if righteousness
come from nature, then Christ is dead in vain. But the law was in existence up to that time,
and it did not justify; and nature existed too, but it did not justify. It was not, then, in vain
that Christ died, in order that the law might be fulfilled through Him who said, “I am come
not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it;”3091 and that our nature, which was lost through

<head>Chapter 26.—The Pelagians Contend that the Grace, Which is Neither the Law Nor
Nature, Avails Only to the Remission of Past Sins, But Not to the Avoidance of
Future Ones.</head>
<p>They also maintain that God’s grace, which is given through the faith of Jesus Christ,
and which is neither the law nor nature, avails only for the remission of sins that have been
committed, and not for the shunning of future ones, or the subjugation of those which are
now assailing us. Now if all this were true, surely after offering the petition of the Lord’s
Prayer, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,” we could hardly go on and say,
“And lead us not into temptation.”3093 The former petition we present that our sins may
be forgiven; the latter, that they may be avoided or subdued,—a favour which we should by
no means beg of our Father who is in heaven if we were able to accomplish it by the virtue
of our human will. Now I strongly advise and earnestly require your Love3094 to read attentively
the book of the blessed Cyprian which he wrote On the Lord’s Prayer. As far as the
Lord shall assist you, understand it, and commit it to memory. In this work you will see
how he so appeals to the free will of those whom he edifies in his treatise, as to show them,
that whatever they have to fulfil in the law, they must ask for in the prayer. But this, of
course, would be utterly empty if the human will were sufficient for the performance without
the help of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 27 <del>XIV.</del>—Grace Effects the Fulfilment of the Law, the Deliverance of
Nature, and the Suppression of Sin’s Dominion.</head>
<p>It has, however, been shown to demonstration that instead of really maintaining free
will, they have only inflated a theory of it, which, having no stability, has fallen to the ground.
Neither the knowledge of God’s law, nor nature, nor the mere remission of sins is that grace
which is given to us through our Lord Jesus Christ; but it is this very grace which accomplishes
the fulfilment of the law, and the liberation of nature, and the removal of the
dominion of sin. Being, therefore, convicted on these points, they resort to another expedient,
and endeavour to show in some way or other that the grace of God is given us according to
our merits. For they say: “Granted that it is not given to us according to the merits of good
works, inasmuch as it is through it that we do any good thing, still it is given to us according
to the merits of a good will; for,” say they, “the good will of him who prays precedes his
prayer, even as the will of the believer preceded his faith, so that according to these merits
the grace of God who hears, follows.”</p>

<pb n="1258"/>
<head>Chapter 28.—Faith is the Gift of God.</head>
<p>I have already discussed3095 the point concerning faith, that is, concerning the will of
him who believes, even so far as to show that it appertains to grace,—so that the apostle did
not tell us, “I have obtained mercy because I was faithful;” but he said, “I have obtained
mercy in order to be faithful.”3096 And there are many other passages of similar import,—
among them that in which he bids us “think soberly, according as God hath dealt
out to every man the proportion of faith;”3097 and that which I have already quoted: “By
grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God;”3098 and
again another in the same Epistle to the Ephesians: “Peace be to the brethren, and love with
faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ;”3099 and to the same effect that passage
in which he says, “For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him,
but also to suffer for His sake.”3100 Both alike are therefore due to the grace of God,—the
faith of those who believe, and the patience of those who suffer, because the apostle spoke
of both as given. Then, again, there is the passage, especially noticeable, in which he says,
“We, having the same spirit of faith,”3101 for his phrase is not “the knowledge of faith,” but
“the spirit of faith;” and he expressed himself thus in order that we might understand how
that faith is given to us, even when it is not sought, so that other blessings may be granted
to it at its request. For “how,” says he, “shall they call upon Him in whom they have not
believed?”3102 The spirit of grace, therefore, causes us to have faith, in order that through
faith we may, on praying for it, obtain the ability to do what we are commanded. On this
account the apostle himself constantly puts faith before the law; since we are not able to do
what the law commands unless we obtain the strength to do it by the prayer of faith.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—God is Able to Convert Opposing Wills, and to Take Away from the
Heart Its Hardness.</head>
<p>Now if faith is simply of free will, and is not given by God, why do we pray for those
who will not believe, that they may believe? This it would be absolutely useless to do, unless
we believe, with perfect propriety, that Almighty God is able to turn to belief wills that are
perverse and opposed to faith. Man’s free will is addressed when it is said, “Today, if ye will
hear His voice, harden not your hearts.”3103 But if God were not able to remove from the
human heart even its obstinacy and hardness, He would not say, through the prophet, “I
will take from them their heart of stone, and will give them a heart of flesh.”3104 That all
this was foretold in reference to the New Testament is shown clearly enough by the apostle
when he says, “Ye are our epistle, . . . written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living
God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.”3105 We must not, of course,
suppose that such a phrase as this is used as if those might live in a fleshly3106 way who
ought to live spiritually; but inasmuch as a stone has no feeling, with which man’s hard heart
is compared, what was there left Him to compare man’s intelligent heart with but the flesh,
which possesses feeling? For this is what is said by the prophet Ezekiel: “I will give them
another heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of
their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; that they may walk in my statutes, and keep
mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, saith
the Lord.”3107 Now can we possibly, without extreme absurdity, maintain that there previously
existed in any man the good merit of a good will, to entitle him to the removal of his
stony heart, when all the while this very heart of stone signifies nothing else than a will of
the hardest kind and such as is absolutely inflexible against God? For where a good will
precedes, there is, of course, no longer a heart of stone.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—The Grace by Which the Stony Heart is Removed is Not Preceded by
Good Deserts, But by Evil Ones.</head>
<p>In another passage, also, by the same prophet, God, in the clearest language, shows us
that it is not owing to any good merits on the part of men, but for His own name’s sake,
that He does these things. This is His language: “This I do, O house of Israel,3108 but for
mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. And
I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned
in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord
God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. For I will take you from among the
heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then
will I sprinkle you with clean water, and ye shall be clean: from all your own filthiness, and
from all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will
I put within you; and the stony heart shall be taken away out of your flesh, and I will give
you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and will cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.”3109 Now who is so blind as not to
see, and who so stone-like as not to feel, that this grace is not given according to the merits
of a good will, when the Lord declares and testifies, “It is I, O house of Israel, who do this,
but for my holy name’s sake”? Now why did He say “It is I that do it, but for my holy name’s
sake,” were it not that they should not think that it was owing to their own good merits that
these things were happening, as the Pelagians hesitate not unblushingly to say? But there
were not only no good merits of theirs, but the Lord shows that evil ones actually preceded;
for He says, “But for my holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen.” Who
can fail to observe how dreadful is the evil of profaning the Lord’s own holy name? And yet,
for the sake of this very name of mine, says He, which ye have profaned, I, even I, will make
you good, but not for your own sakes; and, as He adds, “I will sanctify my great name, which
was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them.” He says
that He sanctifies His name, which He had already declared to be holy. Therefore, this is
just what we pray for in the Lord’s Prayer—“Hallowed be Thy name.”3110 We ask for the
hallowing among men of that which is in itself undoubtedly always holy. Then it follows,
“And the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified
in you.” Although, then, He is Himself always holy, He is, nevertheless, sanctified in those

<head>Chapter 31 <del>XV.</del>—Free Will Has Its Function in the Heart’s Conversion; But Grace
Too Has Its.</head>
<p>Lest, however, it should be thought that men themselves in this matter do nothing by
free will, it is said in the Psalm, “Harden not your hearts;”3111 and in Ezekiel himself, “Cast
away from you all your transgressions, which ye have impiously committed against me; and
make you a new heart and a new spirit; and keep all my commandments. For why will ye
die, O house of Israel, saith the Lord? for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth,
saith the Lord God: and turn ye, and live.”3112 We should remember that it is He who says,
“Turn ye and live,” to whom it is said in prayer, “Turn us again, O God.”3113 We should
remember that He says, “Cast away from you all your transgressions,” when it is even He
who justifies the ungodly. We should remember that He says, “Make you a new heart and
a new spirit,” who also promises, “I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put
within you.”3114 How is it, then, that He who says, “Make you,” also says, “I will give you”?
Why does He command, if He is to give? Why does He give if man is to make, except it be
that He gives what He commands when He helps him to obey whom He commands? There
is, however, always within us a free will,—but it is not always good; for it is either free from
righteousness when it serves sin,—and then it is evil,—or else it is free from sin when it
serves righteousness,—and then it is good. But the grace of God is always good; and by it it
comes to pass that a man is of a good will, though he was before of an evil one. By it also it
comes to pass that the very good will, which has now begun to be, is enlarged, and made so
great that it is able to fulfil the divine commandments which it shall wish, when it shall once
firmly and perfectly wish. This is the purport of what the Scripture says: “If thou wilt, thou
shalt keep the commandments;”3115 so that the man who wills but is not able knows that
he does not yet fully will, and prays that he may have so great a will that it may suffice for
keeping the commandments. And thus, indeed, he receives assistance to perform what he
is commanded. Then is the will of use when we have ability; just as ability is also then of use
when we have the will. For what does it profit us if we will what we are unable to do, or else
do not will what we are able to do?</p>

<head>Chapter 32 <del>XVI.</del>—In What Sense It is Rightly Said That, If We Like, We May Keep
God’s Commandments.</head>
<p>The Pelagians think that they know something great when they assert that “God would
not command what He knew could not be done by man.” Who can be ignorant of this? But
God commands some things which we cannot do, in order that we may know what we ought
to ask of Him. For this is faith itself, which obtains by prayer what the law commands. He,
indeed, who said, “If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,” did in the same book
of Ecclesiasticus afterwards say, “Who shall give a watch before my mouth, and a seal of
wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly thereby, and that my tongue destroy me
not.”3116 Now he had certainly heard and received these commandments: “Keep thy tongue
from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.”3117 Forasmuch, then, as what he said is true:
“If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,” why does he want a watch to be given
before his mouth, like him who says in the Psalm, “Set a watch, O Lord, before my
mouth”?3118 Why is he not satisfied with God’s commandment and his own will; since, if
he has the will, he shall keep the commandments? How many of God’s commandments are
directed against pride! He is quite aware of them; if he will, he may keep them. Why,
therefore, does he shortly afterwards say, “O God, Father and God of my life, give me not
a proud look”?3119 The law had long ago said to him, “Thou shalt not covet;”3120 let him
then only will, and do what he is bidden, because, if he has the will, he shall keep the commandments.
Why, therefore, does he afterwards say, “Turn away from me concupiscence”?
3121 Against luxury, too, how many commandments has God enjoined! Let a man
observe them; because, if he will, he may keep the commandments. But what means that
cry to God, “Let not the greediness of the belly nor lust of the flesh take hold on me!”?3122
Now, if we were to put this question to him personally, he would very rightly answer us and
say, From that prayer of mine, in which I offer this particular petition to God, you may understand
in what sense I said, “If thou wilt, thou mayest keep the commandments.” For it
is certain that we keep the commandments if we will; but because the will is prepared by
the Lord, we must ask of Him for such a force of will as suffices to make us act by the willing.
It is certain that it is we that will when we will, but it is He who makes us will what is good,

of whom it is said (as he has just now expressed it), “The will is prepared by the Lord.”3123
Of the same Lord it is said, “The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and his way doth
He will.”3124 Of the same Lord again it is said, “It is God who worketh in you, even to
will!”3125 It is certain that it is we that act when we act; but it is He who makes us act, by
applying efficacious powers to our will, who has said, “I will make you to walk in my statutes,
and to observe my judgments, and to do them.”3126 When he says, “I will make you . . . to
do them,” what else does He say in fact than, “I will take away from you your heart of
stone,”3127 from which used to arise your inability to act, “and I will give you a heart of
flesh,”3128 in order that you may act? And what does this promise amount to but this: I will
remove your hard heart, out of which you did not act, and I will give you an obedient heart,
out of which you shall act? It is He who causes us to act, to whom the human suppliant says,
“Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth.”3129 That is to say: Make or enable me, O Lord, to
set a watch before my mouth,—a benefit which he had already obtained from God who thus
described its influence: “I set a watch upon my mouth.”3130</p>

<head>Chapter 33 <del>XVII.</del>—A Good Will May Be Small and Weak; An Ample Will, Great
Love. Operating and Co-operating Grace.</head>
<p>He, therefore, who wishes to do God’s commandment, but is unable, already possesses
a good will, but as yet a small and weak one; he will, however, become able when he shall
have acquired a great and robust will. When the martyrs did the great commandments
which they obeyed, they acted by a great will,—that is, with great love. Of this love the Lord
Himself thus speaks: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends.” 3131 In accordance with this, the apostle also says, “He that loveth his neighbour
hath fulfilled the law. For this: Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou
shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly
comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.3132 Love
worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”3133 This love the
Apostle Peter did not yet possess, when he for fear thrice denied the Lord.3134 “There is no
fear in love,” says the Evangelist John in his first Epistle, “but perfect love casteth out fear.”3135
But yet, however small and imperfect his love was, it was not wholly wanting when he said
to the Lord, “I will lay down my life for Thy sake;”3136 for he supposed himself able to effect
what he felt himself willing to do. And who was it that had begun to give him his love,
however small, but He who prepares the will, and perfects by His co-operation what He
initiates by His operation? Forasmuch as in beginning He works in us that we may have the
will, and in perfecting works with us when we have the will.3137 On which account the
apostle says, “I am confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a good work in
you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.”3138 He operates, therefore, without us, in
order that we may will; but when we will, and so will that we may act, He co-operates with
us. We can, however, ourselves do nothing to effect good works of piety without Him either
working that we may will, or co-working when we will. Now, concerning His working that
we may will, it is said: “It is God which worketh in you, even to will.”3139 While of His coworking
with us, when we will and act by willing, the apostle says, “We know that in all

things there is co-working for good to them that love God.”3140 What does this phrase, “all
things,” mean, but the terrible and cruel sufferings which affect our condition? That burden,
indeed, of Christ, which is heavy for our infirmity, becomes light to love. For to such did
the Lord say that His burden was light,3141 as Peter was when he suffered for Christ, not as
he was when he denied Him.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—The Apostle’s Eulogy of Love. Correction to Be Administered with
Love.</head>
<p>This charity, that is, this will glowing with intensest love, the apostle eulogizes with
these words: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,
or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword? (As it is written, For Thy
sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all
these things we are more than conquerors, through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded,
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”3142 And in another passage he says, “And
yet I show unto you a more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of
angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though
I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I
have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. And
though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned,
and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth
not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not
her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in
the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love
never faileth.”3143 And a little afterwards he says, “And now abideth faith, hope, love, these
three; but the greatest of these is love. Follow after love.”3144 He also says to the Galatians,
“For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the
flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”3145 This is the same in effect as what he writes
to the Romans: “He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.”3146 In like manner he says
to the Colossians, “And above all these things, put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.”
3147 And to Timothy he writes, “Now the end of the commandment is love;” and he
goes on to describe the quality of this grace, saying, “Out of a pure heart, and of a good
conscience, and of faith unfeigned.”3148 Moreover, when he says to the Corinthians, “Let

all your things be done with love,”3149 he shows plainly enough that even those chastisements
which are deemed sharp and bitter by those who are corrected thereby, are to be administered
with love. Accordingly, in another passage, after saying, “Warn them that are unruly, comfort
the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men,” he immediately added,
“See that none render evil for evil unto any man.”3150 Therefore, even when the unruly are
corrected, it is not rendering evil for evil, but contrariwise, good. However, what but love
worketh all these things?</p>

yourselves: for love shall cover the multitude of sins.”3151 The Apostle James also says, “If
ye fulfil the royal law, according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,
ye do well.”3152 So also the Apostle John says, “He that loveth his brother abideth in the
right;”3153 again, in another passage, “Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
neither he that loveth not his brother; for this is the message which we have heard from the
beginning, that we should love one another.”3154 Then he says again, “This is His commandment,
that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another.”3155
Once more: “And this commandment have we from Him that he who loveth God love his
brother also.”3156 Then shortly afterwards he adds, “By this we know that we love the children
of God, when we love God, and keep His commandments; for this is the love of God, that
we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous.”3157 While, in his
second Epistle, it is written, “Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but
that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.”3158</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—Love Commended by Our Lord Himself.</head>
<p>Moreover, the Lord Jesus Himself teaches us that the whole law and the prophets hang
upon the two precepts of love to God and love to our neighbour. Concerning these two
commandments the following is written in the Gospel according to St. Mark: “And one of
the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that He had
answered them well, asked Him: Which is the first commandment of all? And Jesus answered
him: The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel! the Lord our God is one Lord;
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
thy mind, and with all thy strength.3159 This is the first commandment. And the second is
like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.3160 There is none other commandment
greater than these.”3161 Also, in the Gospel according to St. John, He says, “A new commandment
I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one
another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love to one another.”</p>

<head>Chapter 37 <del>XVIII.</del>—The Love Which Fulfils the Commandments is Not of
Ourselves, But of God.</head>
<p>All these commandments, however, respecting love or charity3163 (which are so great,
and such that whatever action a man may think he does well is by no means well done if
done without love) would be given to men in vain if they had not free choice of will. But
forasmuch as these precepts are given in the law, both old and new (although in the new
came the grace which was promised in the old, but the law without grace is the letter which
killeth, but in grace the Spirit which giveth life), from what source is there in men the love
of God and of one’s neighbour but from God Himself? For indeed, if it be not of God but
of men, the Pelagians have gained the victory; but if it come from God, then we have vanquished
the Pelagians. Let, then, the Apostle John sit in judgment between us; and let him
say to us, “Beloved, let us love one another.”3164 Now, when they begin to extol themselves
on these words of John, and to ask why this precept is addressed to us at all if we have not
of our own selves to love one another, the same apostle proceeds at once, to their confusion,
to add, “For love is of God.”3165 It is not of ourselves, therefore, but it is of God. Wherefore,
then, is it said, “Let us love one another, for love is of God,” unless it be as a precept to our
free will, admonishing it to seek the gift of God? Now, this would be indeed a thoroughly
fruitless admonition if the will did not previously receive some donation of love, which
might seek to be enlarged so as to fulfil whatever command was laid upon it. When it is
said, “Let us love one another,” it is law; when it is said, “For love is of God,” it is grace. For
God’s “wisdom carries law and mercy upon her tongue.”3166 Accordingly, it is written in
the Psalm, “For He who gave the law will give blessings.”3167</p>

<head>Chapter 38.—We Would Not Love God Unless He First Loved Us. The Apostles
Chose Christ Because They Were Chosen; They Were Not Chosen Because They
Chose Christ.</head>
<p>Let no one, then, deceive you, my brethren, for we should not love God unless He first
loved us. John again gives us the plainest proof of this when he says, “We love Him because
He first loved us.”3168 Grace makes us lovers of the law; but the law itself, without grace,
makes us nothing but breakers of the law. And nothing else than this is shown us by the
words of our Lord when He says to His disciples, Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you.”3169 For if we first loved Him, in order that by this merit He might love us, then we
first chose Him that we might deserve to be chosen by Him. He, however, who is the Truth
says otherwise, and flatly contradicts this vain conceit of men. “You have not chosen me,”
He says. If, therefore, you have not chosen me, undoubtedly you have not loved me (for
how could they choose one whom they did not love?). “But I,” says He, “have chosen you.”
And then could they possibly help choosing Him afterwards, and preferring Him to all the
blessings of this world? But it was because they had been chosen, that they chose Him; not
because they chose Him that they were chosen. There could be no merit in men’s choice of
Christ, if it were not that God’s grace was prevenient in His choosing them. Whence the
Apostle Paul pronounces in the Thessalonians this benediction: “The Lord make you to
increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men.” 3170 This benediction
to love one another He gave us, who had also given us a law that we should love each other.
Then, in another passage addressed to the same church, seeing that there now existed in
some of its members the disposition which he had wished them to cultivate, he says, “We
are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith
groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.”
3171 This he said lest they should make a boast of the great good which they were enjoying
from God, as if they had it of their own mere selves. Because, then, your faith has so great
a growth (this is the purport of his words), and the love of every one of you all toward each
other so greatly abounds, we ought to thank God concerning you, but not to praise you, as
if you possessed these gifts of yourselves.</p>

<head>Chapter 39.—The Spirit of Fear a Great Gift of God.</head>
<p>The apostle also says to Timothy, “For God hath not given to us the spirit of fear, but
of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”3172 Now in respect of this passage of the apostle,
we must be on our guard against supposing that we have not received the spirit of the fear
of God, which is undoubtedly a great gift of God, and concerning which the prophet Isaiah
says, “The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon thee, the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of
the Lord.”3173 It is not the fear with which Peter denied Christ that we have received the
spirit of, but that fear concerning which Christ Himself says, “Fear Him who hath power
to destroy both soul and body in hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear Him.”3174 This, indeed, He
said, lest we should deny Him from the same fear which shook Peter; for such cowardice
he plainly wished to be removed from us when He, in the preceding passage, said, “Be not
afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.”3175 It is not
of this fear that we have received the spirit, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
And of this spirit the same Apostle Paul discourses to the Romans: “We glory in tribulations,
knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope;
and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.”3176 Not by ourselves, therefore, but by the Holy Ghost
which is given to us, does it come to pass that, through that very love, which he shows us
to be the gift of God, tribulation does not do away with patience, but rather produces it.
Again, he says to the Ephesians, “Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith.”3177 Great
blessings these! Let him tell us, however, whence they come. “From God the Father,” says
he immediately afterwards, “and the Lord Jesus Christ.”3178 These great blessings, therefore,
are nothing else than God’s gifts to us.</p>

<head>Chapter 40 <del>XIX.</del>—The Ignorance of the Pelagians in Maintaining that the Knowledge
of the Law Comes from God, But that Love Comes from Ourselves.</head>
<p>It is no wonder that light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it
not.3179 In John’s Epistle the Light declares, “Behold what manner of love the Father hath
bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.”3180 And in the Pelagian
writings the darkness says, “Love comes to us of our own selves.” Now, if they only possessed
the true, that is, Christian love, they would also know whence they obtained possession of
it; even as the apostle knew when he said, “But we have received not the spirit of the world,
but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
God.”3181 John says, “God is love.”3182 And thus the Pelagians affirm that they actually have
God Himself, not from God, but from their own selves! and although they allow that we
have the knowledge of the law from God, they will yet have it that love is from our very
selves. Nor do they listen to the apostle when he says, “Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.”
3183 Now what can be more absurd, nay, what more insane and more alien from the
very sacredness of love itself, than to maintain that from God proceeds the knowledge which,
apart from love, puffs us up, while the love which prevents the possibility of this inflation
of knowledge springs from ourselves? And again, when the apostle speaks of “the love of
Christ as surpassing knowledge,”3184 what can be more insane than to suppose that the
knowledge which must be subordinated to love comes from God, while the love which
surpasses knowledge comes from man? The true faith, however, and sound doctrine declare
that both graces are from God; the Scripture says, “From His face cometh knowledge and
understanding;”3185 and another Scripture says, “Love is of God.”3186 We read of “the
Spirit of wisdom and understanding.”3187 Also of “the Spirit of power, and of love, and of
a sound mind.”3188 But love is a greater gift than knowledge; for whenever a man has the
gift of knowledge, love is necessary by the side of it, that he be not puffed up. For “love envieth
not, vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.”3189</p>

<head>Chapter 41 <del>XX.</del>—The Wills of Men are So Much in the Power of God, that He Can
Turn Them Whithersoever It Pleases Him.</head>
<p>I think I have now discussed the point fully enough in opposition to those who vehemently
oppose the grace of God, by which, however, the human will is not taken away, but
changed from bad to good, and assisted when it is good. I think, too, that I have so discussed
the subject, that it is not so much I myself as the inspired Scripture which has spoken to
you, in the clearest testimonies of truth; and if this divine record be looked into carefully,
it shows us that not only men’s good wills, which God Himself converts from bad ones, and,
when converted by Him, directs to good actions and to eternal life, but also those which
follow the world are so entirely at the disposal of God, that He turns them whithersoever
He wills, and whensoever He wills,—to bestow kindness on some, and to heap punishment
on others, as He Himself judges right by a counsel most secret to Himself, indeed, but beyond
all doubt most righteous. For we find that some sins are even the punishment of other sins,
as are those “vessels of wrath” which the apostle describes as “fitted to destruction;”3190 as
is also that hardening of Pharaoh, the purpose of which is said to be to set forth in him the
power of God;3191 as, again, is the flight of the Israelites from the face of the enemy before
the city of Ai, for fear arose in their heart so that they fled, and this was done that their sin
might be punished in the way it was right that it should be; by reason of which the Lord said
to Joshua the son of Nun, “The children of Israel shall not be able to stand before the face
of their enemies.”3192 What is the meaning of, “They shall not be able to stand”? Now, why
did they not stand by free will, but, with a will perplexed by fear, took to flight, were it not
that God has the lordship even over men’s wills, and when He is angry turns to fear
whomsoever He pleases? Was it not of their own will that the enemies of the children of
Israel fought against the people of God, as led by Joshua, the son of Nun? And yet the
Scripture says, “It was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel
in battle, that they might be exterminated.”3193 And was it not likewise of his own will that
the wicked son of Gera cursed King David? And yet what says David, full of true, and deep,
and pious wisdom? What did he say to him who wanted to smite the reviler? “What,” said
he, “have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Let him alone and let him curse, because the
Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who, then, shall say, Wherefore hast thou done
so?”3194 And then the inspired Scripture, as if it would confirm the king’s profound utterance
by repeating it once more, tells us: “And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold,

my son, which came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more may this
Benjamite do it! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him. It may be
that the Lord will look on my humiliation, and will requite me good for his cursing this
day.” 3195 Now what prudent reader will fail to understand in what way the Lord bade this
profane man to curse David? It was not by a command that He bade him, in which case his
obedience would be praiseworthy; but He inclined the man’s will, which had become debased
by his own perverseness, to commit this sin, by His own just and secret judgment. Therefore
it is said, “The Lord said unto him.” Now if this person had obeyed a command of God, he
would have deserved to be praised rather than punished, as we know he was afterwards
punished for this sin. Nor is the reason an obscure one why the Lord told him after this
manner to curse David. “It may be,” said the humbled king, “that the Lord will look on my
humiliation, and will requite me good for his cursing this day.” See, then, what proof we
have here that God uses the hearts of even wicked men for the praise and assistance of the
good. Thus did He make use of Judas when betraying Christ; thus did He make use of the
Jews when they crucified Christ. And how vast the blessings which from these instances He
has bestowed upon the nations that should believe in Him! He also uses our worst enemy,
the devil himself, but in the best way, to exercise and try the faith and piety of good men,—not
for Himself indeed, who knows all things before they come to pass, but for our sakes, for
whom it was necessary that such a discipline should be gone through with us. Did not Absalom
choose by his own will the counsel which was detrimental to him? And yet the reason
of his doing so was that the Lord had heard his father’s prayer that it might be so. Wherefore
the Scripture says that “the Lord appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the
intent that the Lord might bring all evils upon Absalom.”3196 It called Ahithophel’s counsel
“good,” because it was for the moment of advantage to his purpose. It was in favour of the
son against his father, against whom he had rebelled; and it might have crushed him, had
not the Lord defeated the counsel which Ahithophel had given, by acting on the heart of
Absalom so that he rejected this counsel, and chose another which was not expedient for
him.</p>

<head>Chapter 42 <del>XXI</del>—God Does Whatsoever He Wills in the Hearts of Even Wicked
Men.</head>
<p>Who can help trembling at those judgments of God by which He does in the hearts of
even wicked men whatsoever He wills, at the same time rendering to them according to
their deeds? Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, rejected the salutary counsel of the old men,
not to deal harshly with the people, and preferred listening to the words of the young men
of his own age, by returning a rough answer to those to whom he should have spoken gently.
Now whence arose such conduct, except from his own will? Upon this, however, the ten
tribes of Israel revolted from him, and chose for themselves another king, even Jeroboam,
that the will of God in His anger might be accomplished which He had predicted would
come to pass.3197 For what says the Scripture? “The king hearkened not unto the people;
for the turning was from the Lord, that He might perform His saying, which the Lord spake
to Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.”3198 All this, indeed, was
done by the will of man, although the turning was from the Lord. Read the books of the
Chronicles, and you will find the following passage in the second book: “Moreover, the Lord
stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were
neighbours to the Ethiopians; and they came up to the land of Judah, and ravaged it, and
carried away all the substance which was found in the king’s house.”3199 Here it is shown
that God stirs up enemies to devastate the countries which He adjudges deserving of such
chastisement. Still, did these Philistines and Arabians invade the land of Judah to waste it
with no will of their own? Or were their movements so directed by their own will that the
Scripture lies which tells us that “the Lord stirred up their spirit” to do all this? Both statements
to be sure are true, because they both came by their own will, and yet the Lord stirred
up their spirit; and this may also with equal truth be stated the other way: The Lord both
stirred up their spirit, and yet they came of their own will. For the Almighty sets in motion
even in the innermost hearts of men the movement of their will, so that He does through
their agency whatsoever He wishes to perform through them,—even He who knows not
how to will anything in unrighteousness. What, again, is the purport of that which the man
of God said to King Amaziah: “Let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not
with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim: for if thou shalt think to obtain with these,
the Lord shall put thee to flight before thine enemies: for God hath power either to strengthen
or to put to flight”?3200 Now, how does the power of God help some in war by giving them
confidence, and put others to flight by injecting fear into them, except it be that He who

has made all things according to His own will, in heaven and on earth,3201 also works in
the hearts of men? We read also what Joash, king of Israel, said when he sent a message to
Amaziah, king of Judah, who wanted to fight with him. After certain other words, he added,
“Now tarry at home; why dost thou challenge me to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even
thou, and Judah with thee?”3202 Then the Scripture has added this sequel: “But Amaziah
would not hear; for it came of God, that he might be delivered into their hands, because
they sought after the gods of Edom.”3203 Behold, now, how God, wishing to punish the sin
of idolatry, wrought this in this man’s heart, with whom He was indeed justly angry, not to
listen to sound advice, but to despise it, and go to the battle, in which he with his army was
routed. God says by the prophet Ezekiel, “If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken
a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet: I will stretch out my hand upon him, and
will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.” 3204 Then there is the book of Esther,
who was a woman of the people of Israel, and in the land of their captivity became the wife
of the foreign King Ahasuerus. In this book it is written, that, being driven by necessity to
interpose in behalf of her people, whom the king had ordered to be slain in every part of his
dominions, she prayed to the Lord. So strongly was she urged by the necessity of the case,
that she even ventured into the royal presence without the king’s command, and contrary
to her own custom. Now observe what the Scripture says: “He looked at her like a bull in
the vehemence of his indignation; and the queen was afraid, and her colour changed as she
fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of her delicate maiden which went before her.
But God turned the king, and transformed his indignation into gentleness.”3205 The Scripture
says in the Proverbs of Solomon, “Even as the rush of water, so is the heart of a king in God’s
hand; He will turn it in whatever way He shall choose.”3206 Again, in the 104th Psalm, in
reference to the Egyptians, one reads what God did to them: “And He turned their heart to
hate His people, to deal subtilly with His servants.”3207 Observe, likewise, what is written
in the letters of the apostles. In the Epistle of Paul, the Apostle, to the Romans occur these
words: “Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own
hearts;”3208 and a little afterwards: “For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;”3209

So also in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle says of sundry persons,
“Inasmuch as they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; therefore
also God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might
be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”3211</p>

<head>Chapter 43.—God Operates on Men’s Hearts to Incline Their Wills Whithersoever
He Pleases.</head>
<p>From these statements of the inspired word, and from similar passages which it would
take too long to quote in full, it is, I think, sufficiently clear that God works in the hearts of
men to incline their wills whithersoever He wills, whether to good deeds according to His
mercy, or to evil after their own deserts; His own judgment being sometimes manifest,
sometimes secret, but always righteous. This ought to be the fixed and immoveable conviction
of your heart, that there is no unrighteousness with God. Therefore, whenever you read in
the Scriptures of Truth, that men are led aside, or that their hearts are blunted and hardened
by God, never doubt that some ill deserts of their own have first occurred, so that they justly
suffer these things. Thus you will not run counter to that proverb of Solomon: “The foolishness
of a man perverteth his ways, yet he blameth God in his heart.”3212 Grace, however, is
not bestowed according to men’s deserts; otherwise grace would be no longer grace.3213 For
grace is so designated because it is given gratuitously.3214 Now if God is able, either through
the agency of angels (whether good ones or evil), or in any other way whatever, to operate
in the hearts even of the wicked, in return for their deserts,—whose wickedness was not
made by Him, but was either derived originally from Adam, or increased by their own
will,—what is there to wonder at if, through the Holy Spirit, He works good in the hearts
of the elect, who has wrought it that their hearts become good instead of evil?</p>

<head>Chapter 44 <del>XXII.</del>—Gratuitous Grace Exemplified in Infants.</head>
<p>Men, however, may suppose that there are certain good deserts which they think are
precedent to justification through God’s grace; all the while failing to see, when they express
such an opinion, that they do nothing else than deny grace. But, as I have already remarked,
let them suppose what they like respecting the case of adults, in the case of infants, at any
rate, the Pelagians find no means of answering the difficulty. For these in receiving grace
have no will; from the influence of which they can pretend to any precedent merit. We see,
moreover, how they cry and struggle when they are baptized, and feel the divine sacraments.
Such conduct would, of course, be charged against them as a great impiety, if they already
had free will in use; and notwithstanding this, grace cleaves to them even in their resisting
struggles. But most certainly there is no prevenient merit, otherwise the grace would be no
longer grace. Sometimes, too, this grace is bestowed upon the children of unbelievers, when
they happen by some means or other to fall, by reason of God’s secret providence, into the
hands of pious persons; but, on the other hand, the children of believers fail to obtain grace,
some hindrance occurring to prevent the approach of help to rescue them in their danger.
These things, no doubt, happen through the secret providence of God, whose judgments
are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out. These are the words of the apostle; and
you should observe what he had previously said, to lead him to add such a remark. He was
discoursing about the Jews and Gentiles, when he wrote to the Romans—themselves Gentiles—
to this effect: “For as ye, in times past, have not believed God, yet have now obtained
mercy through their unbelief; even so have these also now not believed, that through your
mercy they also may obtain mercy; for God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He
might have mercy upon all.” 3215 Now, after he had thought upon what he said, full of
wonder at the certain truth of his own assertion, indeed, but astonished at its great depth,
how God concluded all in unbelief that He might have mercy upon all,—as if doing evil that
good might come,—he at once exclaimed, and said, “O the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past
finding out!”3216 Perverse men, who do not reflect upon these unsearchable judgments and
untraceable ways, indeed, but are ever prone to censure, being unable to understand, have
supposed the apostle to say, and censoriously gloried over him for saying, “Let us do evil,
that good may come!” God forbid that the apostle should say so! But men, without understanding,
have thought that this was in fact said, when they heard these words of the apostle:
“Moreover, the law entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace
did much more abound.”3217 But grace, indeed, effects this purpose—that good works

should now be wrought by those who previously did evil; not that they should persevere in
evil courses and suppose that they are recompensed with good. Their language, therefore,
ought not to be: “Let us do evil, that good may come;” but: “We have done evil, and good
has come; let us henceforth do good, that in the future world we may receive good for good,
who in the present life are receiving good for evil.” Wherefore it is written in the Psalm, “I
will sing of mercy and judgment unto Thee, O Lord.”3218 When the Son of man, therefore,
first came into the world, it was not to judge the world, but that the world through Him
might be saved.3219 And this dispensation was for mercy; by and by, however, He will come
for judgment—to judge the quick and the dead. And yet even in this present time salvation
itself does not eventuate without judgment—although it be a hidden one; therefore He says,
“For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not may see, and that they
which see may be made blind.”3220</p>

<head>Chapter 45 <del>XXIII</del>—The Reason Why One Person is Assisted by Grace, and Another
is Not Helped, Must Be Referred to the Secret Judgments of God.</head>
<p>You must refer the matter, then, to the hidden determinations of God, when you see,
in one and the same condition, such as all infants unquestionably have,—who derive their
hereditary evil from Adam,—that one is assisted so as to be baptized, and another is not
assisted, so that he dies in his very bondage; and again, that one baptized person is left and
forsaken in his present life, who God foreknew would be ungodly, while another baptized
person is taken away from this life, “lest that wickedness should alter his understanding;”3221
and be sure that you do not in such cases ascribe unrighteousness or unwisdom to God, in
whom is the very fountain of righteousness and wisdom, but, as I have exhorted you from
the commencement of this treatise, “whereto you have already attained, walk therein,”3222
and “even this shall God reveal unto you,”3223—if not in this life, yet certainly in the next,
“for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed.”3224 When, therefore, you hear the
Lord say, “I the Lord have deceived that prophet,”3225 and likewise what the apostle says:
“He hath mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth,”3226 believe
that, in the case of him whom He permits to be deceived and hardened, his evil deeds have
deserved the judgment; whilst in the case of him to whom He shows mercy, you should
loyally and unhesitatingly recognise the grace of the God who “rendereth not evil for evil;
but contrariwise blessing.”3227 Nor should you take away from Pharaoh free will, because
in several passages God says, “I have hardened Pharaoh;” or,” I have hardened or I will
harden Pharaoh’s heart;”3228 for it does not by any means follow that Pharaoh did not, on
this account, harden his own heart. For this, too, is said of him, after the removal of the flyplague
from the Egyptians, in these words of the Scripture: “And Pharaoh hardened his
heart at this time also; neither would he let the people go.”3229 Thus it was that both God
hardened him by His just judgment, and Pharaoh by his own free will. Be ye then well assured
that your labour will never be in vain, if, setting before you a good purpose, you persevere
in it to the last. For God, who fails to render, according to their deeds, only to those whom

He is good; and good for good, because He is good and just; only, evil for good He will
never recompense, because He is not unjust. He will, therefore, recompense evil for

unrighteousness; and He will recompense good for good—grace for grace.</p>

<head>Chapter 46 <del>XXIV.</del>—Understanding and Wisdom Must Be Sought from God.</head>
<p>Peruse attentively this treatise, and if you understand it, give God the praise; but where
you fail to understand it, pray for understanding, for God will give you understanding. Remember
what the Scriptures say: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth
to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given to him.”3231 Wisdom itself
cometh down from above, as the Apostle James himself tells us.3232 There is, however, another
wisdom, which you must repel from you, and pray against its remaining in you; this
the same apostle expressed his detestation of when he said, “But if ye have bitter envying
and strife in your hearts, . . . this is not the wisdom which descendeth from above, but is
earthly, sensual, devilish. For wherever there is envying and strife, there is also confusion,
and every evil work. But the wisdom which is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,
and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good works, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.”
3233 What blessing, then, will that man not have who has prayed for this wisdom
and obtained it of the Lord? And from this you may understand what grace is; because if
this wisdom were of ourselves, it would not be from above; nor would it be an object to be
asked for of the God who created us. Brethren, pray ye for us also, that we may live “soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,”3234 to whom belong the honour, and the
glory, and the kingdom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>A TREATISE ON REBUKE AND GRACE,
BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;
In One Book,</head>
<p>addressed to valentine, and with him to the monks of adrumetum.
a.d. 426 or 427</p>
<p>In the beginning the writer sets forth what is the Catholic faith concerning law, concerning
free will, and concerning grace. He teaches that the grace of God by Jesus Christ is that by
which alone men are delivered from evil, and without which they do absolutely no good;
and this not only by the fact that it points out what is to be done, but that it also supplies
the means of doing it with love, since God bestows on men the inspiration of a good will
and deed. He teaches that the rebuke of evil men who have not received this grace is neither
unjust—since they are evil by their own will—nor useless, although it must be confessed
that it is only by God’s agency that it can avail. That perseverance in good is truly a great
gift of God, but that still the rebuke of one who has not persevered must not on that account
be neglected; and that if a man who has not received this gift should relapse of his own
will into sin, he is not only deserving of rebuke, but if he should continue in evil until his
death, he is moreover worthy of eternal damnation. That it is inscrutable why one should
receive this gift and another should not receive it. That of those who are predestinated
none can perish. And that the perseverance, which all do not receive who are here called
children of God, is constantly given to all those who are truly children by God’s foreknowledge
and predestination. He answers the question which suggests itself concerning
Adam—in what way he sinned by not persevering, since he did not receive perseverance.
He shows that such assistance was at the first given to him, as that without it he could
not continue if he would, not as that with it it must result that he would. But that now
through Christ is given us not only such help as that without it we cannot continue even
if we will, but moreover such and so great as that by it we will. He proves that the number
of the predestinated, to whom a gift of this kind is appropriated, is certain, and can neither
be increased nor diminished. And since it is unknown who belongs to that number, and
who does not, that medicinal rebuke must be applied to all who sin, lest they should either
themselves perish, or be the ruin of others. Finally, he concludes that neither is rebuke
prohibited by grace, nor is grace denied by rebuke.</p>

<p>I Have read your letter—Valentine, my dearly beloved brother, and you who are associated
with him in the service of God—which your Love sent by brother Florus and those
who came to us with him; and I gave God thanks that I have known your peace in the Lord
and agreement in the truth and ardour in love, by your discourse delivered to us. But that
an enemy has striven among you to the subversion of some, has, by the mercy of God and
His marvellous goodness in turning his arts to the advantage3236 of His servants, rather
availed to this result, that while none of you were cast down for the worse, some were built
up for the better. There is therefore no need to reconsider again and again all that I have
already transmitted to you, sufficiently argued out in a lengthy treatise;3237 for your replies
indicate how you have received this. Nevertheless, do not in any wise suppose that, when
once read, it can have become sufficiently well known to you. Therefore if you desire to
have it exceedingly productive, do not count it a grievance by re-perusal to make it thoroughly
familiar; so that you may most accurately3238 know what and what kind of questions they
are, for the solution and satisfaction of which there arises an authority not human but divine,
from which we ought not to depart if we desire to attain to the point whither we are tending.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—The Catholic Faith Concerning Law, Grace, and Free Will.</head>
<p>Now the Lord Himself not only shows us what evil we should shun, and what good we
should do, which is all that the letter of the law is able to effect; but He moreover helps us
that we may shun evil and do good,3239 which none can do without the Spirit of grace; and
if this be wanting, the law comes in merely to make us guilty and to slay us. It is on this account
that the apostle says, “The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.”3240 He, then, who
lawfully uses the law learns therein evil and good, and, not trusting in his own strength,
flees to grace, by the help of which he may shun evil and do good. But who is there who
flees to grace except when “the steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He shall determine
his way”?3241 And thus also to desire the help of grace is the beginning of grace; of which,
says he, “And I said, Now I have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most
High.”3242 It is to be confessed, therefore, that we have free choice to do both evil and good;
but in doing evil every one is free from righteousness and a servant of sin, while in doing
good no one can be free, unless he have been made free by Him who said, “If the Son shall
make you free, then you shall be free indeed.”3243 Neither is it thus, that when any one has
been made free from the dominion of sin, he no longer needs the help of his Deliverer; but
rather thus, that hearing from Him, “Without me ye can do nothing,”3244 he himself also
says to Him, “Be thou my helper! Forsake me not.”3245 I rejoice that I have found in our
brother Florus also this faith, which without doubt is the true and prophetical and apostolical
and catholic faith; whence those are the rather to be corrected—whom indeed I now
think to have been corrected by the favour of God—who did not understand him.</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>II.</del>—What the Grace of God Through Jesus Christ is.</head>
<p>For the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord must be apprehended,—as that by
which alone men are delivered from evil, and without which they do absolutely no good
thing, whether in thought, or will and affection, or in action; not only in order that they
may know, by the manifestation of that grace, what should be done, but moreover in order
that, by its enabling, they may do with love what they know. Certainly the apostle asked for
this inspiration of good will and work on behalf of those to whom he said, “Now we pray
to God that ye do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that
which is good.”3246 Who can hear this and not awake and confess that we have it from the
Lord God that we turn aside from evil and do good?—since the apostle indeed says not, We
admonish, we teach, we exhort, we rebuke; but he says, “We pray to God that ye do no evil,
but that ye should do that which is good.”3247 And yet he was also in the habit of speaking
to them, and doing all those things which I have mentioned,—he admonished, he taught,
he exhorted, he rebuked. But he knew that all these things which he was doing in the way
of planting and watering openly3248 were of no avail unless He who giveth the increase in
secret should give heed to his prayer on their behalf. Because, as the same teacher of the
Gentiles says, “Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that
giveth the increase.”3249</p>

prescribed to us that we should turn away from evil and do good, if it is not we that do this,
but ‘God who worketh in us to will and to do it’?”3250 But let them rather understand that
if they are the children of God, they are led by the Spirit of God3251 to do that which should
be done; and when they have done it, let them give thanks to Him by whom they act. For
they are acted upon that they may act, not that they may themselves do nothing; and in addition
to this, it is shown them what they ought to do, so that when they have done it as it
ought to be done—that is, with the love and the delight of righteousness—they may rejoice
in having received “the sweetness which the Lord has given, that their 3252 land should yield
her increase.”3253 But when they do not act, whether by not doing at all or by not doing
from love, let them pray that what as yet they have not, they may receive. For what shall
they have which they shall not receive? or what have they which they have not received?3254</p>

<p>“Then,” say they, “let those who are over us only prescribe to us what we ought to do,
and pray for us that we may do it; but let them not rebuke and censure us if we should not
do it.” Certainly let all be done, since the teachers of the churches, the apostles, were in the
habit of doing all,—as well prescribing what things should be done, as rebuking if they were
not done, and praying that they might be done. The apostle prescribes, saying, “Let all your
things be done with love.”3255 He rebukes, saying, “Now therefore there is utterly a fault
among you, because ye have judgments among yourselves. For why do ye not rather suffer
wrong? Why are ye not rather defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong and defraud; and that, your
brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not possess the kingdom of God?”3256 Let
us hear him also praying: “And the Lord,” says he, “multiply you, and make you to abound
in love one towards another and towards all men.”3257 He prescribes, that love should be
maintained; he rebukes, because love is not maintained; he prays, that love may abound. O
man! learn by his precept what you ought to have; learn by his rebuke that it is by your own
fault that you have it not; learn by his prayer whence you may receive what you desire to
have.</p>

<p>“How,” says he,3258 “is it my fault that I have not what I have not received from Him,
when unless it is given by Him, there is no other at all whence such and so great a gift can
be had?” Suffer me a little, my brethren, not as against you whose heart is right with God,
but as against those who mind earthly things, or as against those human modes of thinking
themselves, to contend for the truth, of the heavenly and divine grace. For they who say this
are such as in their wicked works are unwilling to be rebuked by those who proclaim this
grace. “Prescribe to me what I shall do, and if I should do it, give thanks to God for me who
has given me to do it; but if I do it not, I must not be rebuked, but He must be besought to
give what He has not given; that is, that very believing love of God and of my neighbour by
which His precepts are3259 observed. Pray, then, for me that I may receive this, and may by
its means do freely and with good will that which He commands. But I should be justly rebuked
if by my own fault I had it not; that is, if I myself could give it to myself, or could receive
it, and did not do so, or if He should give it and I should be unwilling to receive it. But
since even the will itself is prepared3260 by the Lord, why dust thou rebuke me because thou
seeest me unwilling to do His precepts, and dust not rather ask Him Himself to work in me
the will also?”</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>V.</del>—The Necessity and Advantage of Rebuke.</head>
<p>To this we answer: Whoever you are that do not the commandments of God that are
already known to you, and do not wish to be rebuked, you must be rebuked even for that
very reason that you do not wish to be rebuked. For you do not wish that your faults should
be pointed out to you; you do not wish that they should be touched, and that such a useful
pain should be caused you that you may seek the Physician; you do not desire to be shown
to yourself, that, when you see yourself to be deformed, you may wish for the Reformer,
and may supplicate Him that you may not continue in that repulsiveness. For it is your fault
that you are evil; and it is a greater fault to be unwilling to be rebuked because you are evil,
as if faults should either be praised, or regarded with indifference so as neither to be praised
nor blamed, or as if, indeed, the dread, or the shame, or the mortification of the rebuked
man were of no avail, or were of any other avail in healthfully stimulating, except to cause
that He who is good may be besought, and so out of evil men who are rebuked may make
good men who may be praised. For what he who will not be rebuked desires to be done for
him, when he says, “Pray for me rather,”—he must be rebuked for that very reason that he
may himself also do for himself; because that mortification with which he is dissatisfied
with himself when he feels the sting of rebuke, stirs him up to a desire for more earnest
prayer, 3261 that, by God’s mercy, he may be aided by the increase of love, and cease to do
things which are shameful and mortifying, and do things praiseworthy and gladdening.
This is the benefit of rebuke that is wholesomely applied, sometimes with greater, sometimes
with less severity, in accordance with the diversity of sins; and it is then wholesome when
the supreme Physician looks. For it is of no profit unless when it makes a man repent of his
sin. And who gives this but He who looked upon the Apostle Peter when he denied,3262 and
made him weep? Whence also the Apostle Paul, after he said that they were to be rebuked
with moderation who thought otherwise, immediately added, “Lest perchance God give
them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth, and they recover themselves out of the
snares of the devil.”3263</p>

their own evil inclination, reject these things also, and say, “I wish you neither to prescribe
to me, nor to pray for me”? For what man is shown to have prayed for Peter, that God should
give him the repentance wherewith he bewailed the denial of his Lord? What man instructed
Paul in the divine precepts which pertain to the Christian faith? When, therefore, he was
heard preaching the gospel, and saying, “For I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which
was preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it from man, nor did I learn it,
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ,”3264—would it be replied to him: “Why are you
troubling us to receive and to learn from you that which you have not received nor learnt
from man? He who gave to you is able also to give to us in like manner as to you.” Moreover,
if they dare not say this, but suffer the gospel to be preached to them by man, although it
cannot be given to man by man, let them concede also that they ought to be rebuked by
those who are set over them, by whom Christian grace is preached; although it is not denied
that God is able, even when no man rebukes, to correct whom He will, and to lead him on
to the wholesome mortification of repentance by the most hidden and mighty power of His
medicine. And as we are not to cease from prayer on behalf of those whom we desire to be
corrected,—even although without any man’s prayer on behalf of Peter, the Lord looked
upon him and caused him to bewail his sin,—so we must not neglect rebuke, although God
can make those whom He will to be corrected, even when not rebuked. But a man then
profits by rebuke when He pities and aids who makes those whom He will to profit even
without rebuke. But wherefore these are called to be reformed in one way, those in another
way, and others in still another way, after different and innumerable manners, be it far from
us to assert that it is the business of the clay to judge, but of the potter.</p>

<head>Chapter 9 <del>VI</del>—Why They May Justly Be Rebuked Who Do Not Obey God, Although
They Have Not Yet Received the Grace of Obedience.</head>
<p>“The apostle says,” say they, “‘For who maketh thee to differ? And what hast thou that
thou hast not received? Now also if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou
hadst not received it?’3265 Why, then, are we rebuked, censured, reproved, accused? What
do we do, we who have not received?” They who say this wish to appear without blame in
respect of their not obeying God, because assuredly obedience itself is His gift; and that gift
must of necessity be in him in whom dwells love, which without doubt is of God,3266 and
the Father gives it to His children. “This,” say they, “we have not received. Why, then, are
we rebuked, as if we were able to give it to ourselves, and of our own choice would not give
it?” And they do not observe that, if they are not yet regenerated, the first reason why, when
they are reproached because they are disobedient to God, they ought to be dissatisfied with
themselves is, that God made man upright from the beginning of the human creation, 3267
and there is no unrighteousness with God.3268 And thus the first depravity, whereby God
is not obeyed, is of man, because, falling by his own evil will from the rectitude in which
God at first made him, he became depraved. Is, then, that depravity not to be rebuked in a
man because it is not peculiar to him who is rebuked, but is common to all? Nay, let that
also be rebuked in individuals, which is common to all. For the circumstance that none is
altogether free from it is no reason why it should not attach to each man. Those original
sins, indeed, are said to be the sins of others, because individuals derived them from their
parents; but they are not unreasonably said to be our own also, because in that one, as the
apostle says, all have sinned.3269 Let, then, the damnable source be rebuked, that from the
mortification of rebuke may spring the will of regeneration,—if, indeed, he who is rebuked
is a child of promise,—in order that, by the noise of the rebuke sounding and lashing from
without, God may by His hidden inspiration work in him from within to will also. If, however,
being already regenerate and justified, he relapses of his own will into an evil life, assuredly
he cannot say, “I have not received,” because of his own free choice to evil he has lost the
grace of God, that he had received. And if, stung with compunction by rebuke, he wholesomely
bewails, and returns to similar good works, or even better, certainly here most
manifestly appears the advantage of rebuke. But yet for rebuke by the agency of man to
avail, whether it be of love or not, depends only upon God.</p>

<head>Chapter 10—All Perseverance is God’s Gift.</head>
<p>Is such an one as is unwilling to be rebuked still able to say, “What have I done,—I who
have not received?” when it appears plainly that he has received, and by his own fault has
lost that which he has received? “I am able,” says he, “I am altogether able,—when you reprove
me for having of my own will relapsed from a good life into a bad one,—still to say, What
have I done,—I who have not received? For I have received faith, which worketh by love,
but I have not received perseverance therein to the end. Will any one dare to say that this
perseverance is not the gift of God, and that so great a possession as this is ours in such wise
that if any one have it the apostle could not say to him, ‘For what hast thou which thou hast
not received?’3270 since he has this in such a manner as that he has not received it?” To this,
indeed, we are not able to deny, that perseverance in good, progressing even to the end, is
also a great gift of God; and that it exists not save it come from Him of whom it is written,
“Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of
lights.”3271 But the rebuke of him who has not persevered must not on that account be
neglected, “lest God perchance give unto him repentance, and he recover from the snares
of the devil;”3272 since to the usefulness of rebuke the apostle has subjoined this decision,
saying, as I have above mentioned, “Rebuking with moderation those that think differently,
lest at any time God give them repentance.”3273 For if we should say that such a perseverance,
so laudable and so blessed, is man’s in such wise as that he has it not from God, we first of
all make void that which the Lord says to Peter: “I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail
not.”3274 For what did He ask for him, but perseverance to the end? And assuredly, if a man
could have this from man, it should not have been asked from God. Then when the apostle
says, “Now we pray to God that ye do no evil,”3275 beyond a doubt he prays to God on their
behalf for perseverance. For certainly he does not “do no evil” who forsakes good, and, not
persevering in good, turns to the evil, from which he ought to turn aside.3276 In that place,
moreover, where he says, “I thank my God in every remembrance of you, always in every

prayer of mine for you all making quest with joy for your fellowship3277 in the gospel from
the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good
work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,”3278—what else does he promise
to them from the mercy of God than perseverance in good to the end? And again where he
says, “Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, always striving
for you in prayer, that you may stand perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God,”3279—what
is “that you may stand” but “that you may persevere”? Whence it was said of the devil, “He
stood not in the truth;”3280 because he was there, but he did not continue. For assuredly
those were already standing in the faith. And when we pray that he who stands may stand,
we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the apostle, again, when
he says, “Now unto Him that is able to keep you without offence, and to establish you before
the presence of His glory, immaculate in joy,”3281 does he not most manifestly show that
perseverance in good unto the end is God’s gift? For what but a good perseverance does He
give who preserves without offence that He may place before the presence of His glory im-
maculate in joy? What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: “And when
the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were
ordained to eternal life believed”? 3282 Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift
of perseverance? And when we read, “He that shall persevere unto the end shall be saved;”3283
with what salvation but eternal? And when, in the Lord’s Prayer, we say to God the Father,
“Hallowed be Thy name,”3284 what do we ask but that His name may be hallowed in us?
And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily
asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For
the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of
the same prayer, he says: “We say, ‘Hallowed be Thy name,’ not that we wish for God that
He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed
in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because He said, ‘Be
ye holy, since I also am holy;’3285 we ask and entreat that we who have been hallowed in
baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to be.”3286 Behold the most glorious

<head>Chapter 11 <del>VII.</del>—They Who Have Not Received the Gift of Perseverance, and
Have Relapsed into Mortal Sin and Have Died Therein, Must Righteously Be
Condemned.</head>
<p>If, then, these things be so, we still rebuke those, and reasonably rebuke them, who, although
they were living well, have not persevered therein; because they have of their own
will been changed from a good to an evil life, and on that account are worthy of rebuke; and
if rebuke should be of no avail to them, and they should persevere in their ruined life until
death, they are also worthy of divine condemnation for ever. Neither shall they excuse
themselves, saying,—as now they say, “Wherefore are we rebuked?”—so then, “Wherefore
are we condemned, since indeed, that we might return from good to evil, we did not receive
that perseverance by which we should abide in good?” They shall by no means deliver
themselves by this excuse from righteous condemnation. For if, according to the word of
truth, no one is delivered from the condemnation which was incurred through Adam except
through the faith of Jesus Christ, and yet from this condemnation they shall not deliver
themselves who shall be able to say that they have not heard the gospel of Christ, on the
ground that “faith cometh by hearing,”3287 how much less shall they deliver themselves who
shall say, “We have not received perseverance!” For the excuse of those who say, “We have
not received hearing,” seems more equitable than that of those who say, “We have not received
perseverance;” since it may be said, O man, in that which thou hadst heard and kept,
in that thou mightest persevere if thou wouldest; but in no wise can it be said, That which
thou hadst not heard thou mightest believe if thou wouldest.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—They Who Have Not Received Perseverance are Not Distinguished
from the Mass of Those that are Lost.</head>
<p>And, consequently, both those who have not heard the gospel, and those who, having
heard it and been changed by it for the better, have not received perseverance, and those
who, having heard the gospel, have refused to come to Christ, that is, to believe on Him,
since He Himself says, “No man cometh unto me, except it were given him of my Father,”3288
and those who by their tender age were unable to believe, but might be absolved from original
sin by the sole laver of regeneration, and yet have not received this laver, and have
perished in death: are not made to differ from that lump which it is plain is condemned, as
all go from one into condemnation. Some are made to differ, however, not by their own
merits, but by the grace of the Mediator; that is to say, they are justified freely in the blood
of the second Adam. Therefore, when we hear, “For who maketh thee to differ? and what
hast thou that thou hast not received? Now, if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as
if thou hadst not received it?”3289 we ought to understand that from that mass of perdition
which originated through the first Adam, no one can be made to differ except he who has
this gift, which whosoever has, has received by the grace of the Saviour. And this apostolical
testimony is so great, that the blessed Cyprian writing to Quirinus put it in the place of a
title, when he says, “That we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.”3290</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Election is of Grace, Not of Merit.</head>
<p>Whosoever, then, are made to differ from that original condemnation by such bounty
of divine grace, there is no doubt but that for such it is provided that they should hear the
gospel, and when they hear they believe, and in the faith which worketh by love they persevere
unto the end; and if, perchance, they deviate from the way, when they are rebuked they are
amended and some of them, although they may not be rebuked by men, return into the
path which they had left; and some who have received grace in any age whatever are withdrawn
from the perils of this life by swiftness of death. For He worketh all these things in
them who made them vessels of mercy, who also elected them in His Son before the
foundation of the world by the election of grace: “And if by grace, then is it no more of
works, otherwise grace is no more grace.”3291 For they were not so called as not to be elected,
in respect of which it is said, “For many are called but few are elected;”3292 but because they
were called according to the purpose, they are of a certainty also elected by the election, as
it is said, of grace, not of any precedent merits of theirs, because to them grace is all merit.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—None of the Elect and Predestinated Can Perish.</head>
<p>Of such says the apostle, “We know that to those that love God He worketh together
all things for good, to them who are called according to His purpose; because those whom
He before foreknew, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that
He might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate,
them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified,
them He also glorified.” 3293 Of these no one perishes, because all are elected. And they are
elected because they were called according to the purpose—the purpose, however, not their
own, but God’s; of which He elsewhere says, “That the purpose of God according to election
might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said unto her that the elder shall
serve the younger.”3294 And in another place he says, “Not according to our works, but according
to His own purpose and grace.”3295 When, therefore, we hear, “Moreover, whom
He did predestinate, them He also called,”3296 we ought to acknowledge that they were
called according to His purpose; since He thence began, saying, “He worketh together all
things for good to those who are called according to His purpose,” and then added, “Because
those whom He before foreknew, He also did predestinate, to be conformed to the image
of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren.” And to these promises
He added, “Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called.” He wishes these,
therefore, to be understood whom He called according to His purpose, lest any among them
should be thought to be called and not elected, on account of that sentence of the Lord’s:
“Many the called but few are elected.”3297 For whoever are elected are without doubt also
called; but not whosoever are called are as a consequence elected. Those, then, are elected,
as has often been said, who are called according to the purpose, who also are predestinated
and foreknown. If any one of these perishes, God is mistaken; but none of them perishes,
because God is not mistaken. If any one of these perish, God is overcome by human sin;
but none of them perishes, because God is overcome by nothing. Moreover, they are elected
to reign with Christ, not as Judas was elected, to a work for which he was fitted. Because he
was chosen by Him who well knew how to make use even of wicked men, so that even by
his damnable deed that venerable work, for the sake of which He Himself had come, might
be accomplished. When, therefore, we hear, “Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you

who is at the right hand of God, who also soliciteth on our behalf?”3299 And of how stedfast
a perseverance even to the end they have received the gift, let them follow on to say: “Who
shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, Because for thy sake we are killed
all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. But in all these things we are
more than conquerors, through Him that hath loved us. For I am certain, that neither death,

that Hymenæus and Philetus had subverted the faith of some, it is presently added, “Nevertheless
the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord has known them
that are His.”3301 The faith of these, which worketh by love, either actually does not fail at
all, or, if there are any whose faith fails, it is restored before their life is ended, and the iniquity
which had intervened is done away, and perseverance even to the end is allotted to them.
But they who are not to persevere, and who shall so fall away from Christian faith and conduct
that the end of this life shall find them in that case, beyond all doubt are not to be reckoned
in the number of these, even in that season wherein they are living well and piously. For
they are not made to differ from that mass of perdition by the foreknowledge and predestination
of God, and therefore are not called according to God’s purpose, and thus are not
elected; but are called among those of whom it was said, “Many are called,” not among those
of whom it was said, “But few are elected.” And yet who can deny that they are elect, since
they believe and are baptized, and live according to God? Manifestly, they are called elect
by those who are ignorant of what they shall be, but not by Him who knew that they would
not have the perseverance which leads the elect forward into the blessed life, and knows that
they so stand, as that He has foreknown that they will fall.</p>

<head>Chapter 17 <del>VIII.</del>—Why Perseverance Should Be Given to One and Not Another
is Inscrutable.</head>
<p>Here, if I am asked why God should not have given them perseverance to whom He
gave that love by which they might live Christianly, I answer that I do not know. For I do
not speak arrogantly, but with acknowledgment of my small measure, when I hear the apostle
saying, “O man, who art thou that repliest against God?”3302 and, “O the depth of the riches
of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways
untraceable!”3303 So far, therefore, as He condescends to manifest His judgments to us, let
us give thanks; but so far as He thinks fit to conceal them, let us not murmur against His
counsel, but believe that this also is the most wholesome for us. But whoever you are that
are hostile to His grace, and thus ask, what do you yourself say? it is well that you do not
deny yourself to be a Christian and boast of being a catholic. If, therefore, you confess that
to persevere to the end in good is God’s gift, I think that equally with me you are ignorant
why one man should receive this gift and another should not receive it; and in this case we
are both unable to penetrate the unsearchable judgments of God. Or if you say that it pertains
to man’s free will—which you defend, not in accordance with God’s grace, but in opposition
to it—that any one should persevere in good, or should not persevere, and it is not by the
gift of God if he persevere, but by the performance of human will, why will you strive against
the words of Him who says, “I have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not”?3304 Will
you dare to say that even when Christ prayed that Peter’s faith might not fail, it would still
have failed if Peter had willed it to fail; that is, if he had been unwilling that it should continue
even to the end? As if Peter could in any measure will otherwise than Christ had asked for
him that he might will. For who does not know that Peter’s faith would then have perished
if that will by which he was faithful should fail, and that it would have continued if that same
will should abide? But because “the will is prepared by the Lord,”3305 therefore Christ’s petition
on his behalf could not be a vain petition. When, then, He prayed that his faith should
not fail, what was it that he asked for, but that in his faith he should have a most free, strong,
invincible, persevering will! Behold to what an extent the freedom of the will is defended in
accordance with the grace of God, not in opposition to it; because the human will does not
attain grace by freedom, but rather attains freedom by grace, and a delightful constancy,
and an insuperable fortitude that it may persevere.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, to be wondered at, and greatly to be wondered at, that to some of His own
children—whom He has regenerated in Christ—to whom He has given faith, hope, and
love, God does not give perseverance also, when to children of another He forgives such
wickedness, and, by the bestowal of His grace, makes them His own children. Who would
not wonder at this? Who would not be exceedingly astonished at this? But, moreover, it is
not less marvellous, and still true, and so manifest that not even the enemies of God’s grace
can find any means of denying it, that some children of His friends, that is, of regenerated
and good believers, departing this life as infants without baptism,—although He certainly
might provide the grace of this laver if He willed, since in His power are all things,—He
alienates from His kingdom into which He introduces their parents; and some children of
His enemies He causes to come into the hands of Christians, and by means of this laver introduces
into the kingdom, from which their parents are aliens; although, as well to the
former infants there is no evil deserving, as to the latter there is no good, of their own
proper will. Certainly, in this case the judgments of God, because they are righteous and
deep, may neither be blamed nor penetrated. Among these also is that concerning perseverance,
of which we are now discoursing. Of both, therefore, we may exclaim, “O the depth
of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments!”3306</p>

not given, since with Him is no respect of persons; such things as are not conferred on the

intellects and mental natures capable of many arts, or such as fall to man’s lot from without,
such as are wealth, nobility, honours, and other things of this kind, which it is in the power
of God alone that a man should have; not to dwell even on the baptism of infants (which
none of those objectors can say does not pertain, as might be said of those other matters, to
the kingdom of God), why it is given to this infant and not given to that, since both of them
are equally in God’s power, and without that sacrament none can enter into the kingdom
of God;—to be silent, then, on these matters, or to leave them on one side, let men consider
those very special cases of which we are treating. For we are discoursing of such as have not
perseverance in goodness, but die in the decline of their good will from good to evil. Let the
objectors answer, if they can, why, when these were living faithfully and piously, God did
not then snatch them from the perils of this life, “lest wickedness should change their understanding,
and lest deceit should beguile their souls”?3307 Had He not this in His power, or
was He ignorant of their future sinfulness? Assuredly, nothing of this kind is said, except
most perversely and insanely. Why, then, did He not do this? Let them reply who mock at
us when in such matters we exclaim, “How inscrutable are His judgments, and His ways
past finding out!”3308 For either God giveth this to whom He will, or certainly that Scripture
is wrong which says concerning the immature death of the righteous man, “He was taken
away lest wickedness should change his understanding, or lest deceit should beguile his
soul.”3309 Why, then, does God give this so great benefit to some, and not give it to others,
seeing that in Him is no unrighteousness3310 nor acceptance of persons,3311 and that it is
in His power how long every one may remain in this life, which is called a trial upon
earth?3312 As, then, they are constrained to confess that it is God’s gift for a man to end this
life of his before it can be changed from good to evil, but they do not know why it is given
to some and not given to others, so let them confess with us that perseverance in good is
God’s gift, according to the Scriptures, from which I have already set down many testimonies;

<head>Chapter 20 <del>IX.</del>—Some are Children of God According to Grace Temporally Received,
Some According to God’s Eternal Foreknowledge.</head>
<p>Nor let it disturb us that to some of His children God does not give this perseverance.
Be this far from being so, however, if these were of those who are predestinated and called
according to His purpose,—who are truly the children of the promise. For the former, while
they live piously, are called children of God; but because they will live wickedly, and die in
that impiety, the foreknowledge of God does not call them God’s children. For they are
children of God whom as yet we have not, and God has already, of whom the Evangelist
John says, “that Jesus should die for that nation, and not for that nation only, but that also
He should gather together in one the children of God which were scattered abroad;”3313
and this certainly they were to become by believing, through the preaching of the gospel.
And yet before this had happened they had already been enrolled as sons of God with unchangeable
stedfastness in the memorial of their Father. And, again, there are some who
are called by us children of God on account of grace received even in temporal things, yet
are not so called by God; of whom the same John says, “They went out from us, but they
were not of us, because if they had been of us they would, no doubt, have continued with
us.”3314 He does not say, “They went out from us, but because they did not abide with us
they are no longer now of us;” but he says, “They went out from us, but they were not of
us,”—that is to say, even when they appeared among us, they were not of us. And as if it
were said to him, Whence do you prove this? he says, “Because if they had been of us, they
would assuredly have continued with us.”3315 It is the word of God’s children; John is the
speaker, who was ordained to a chief place among the children of God. When, therefore,
God’s children say of those who had not perseverance, “They went out from us, but they
were not of us,” and add, “Because if they had been of us, they would assuredly have continued
with us,” what else do they say than that they were not children, even when they were
in the profession and name of children? Not because they simulated righteousness, but because
they did not continue in it. For he does not say, “For if they had been of us, they would
assuredly have maintained a real and not a feigned righteousness with us;” but he says, “If
they had been of us, they would assuredly have continued with us.” Beyond a doubt, he
wished them to continue in goodness. Therefore they were in goodness; but because they
did not abide in it,—that is, they did not persevere unto the end,—he says, They were not
of us, even when they were with us,—that is, they were not of the number of children, even
when they were in the faith of children; because they who are truly children are foreknown
and predestinated as conformed to the image of His Son, and are called according to His

<p>Those, then, were of the multitude of the called, but they were not of the fewness of the
elected. It is not, therefore, to His predestinated children that God has not given perseverance
for they would have it if they were in that number of children; and what would they have
which they had not received, according to the apostolical and true judgment?3317 And thus
such children would be given to Christ the Son just as He Himself says to the Father, “That
all that Thou hast given me may not perish, but have eternal life.”3318 Those, therefore, are
understood to be given to Christ who are ordained to eternal life. These are they who are
predestinated and called according to the purpose, of whom not one perishes. And therefore
none of them ends this life when he has changed from good to evil, because he is so ordained,
and for that purpose given to Christ, that he may not perish, but may have eternal life. And
again, those whom we call His enemies, or the infant children of His enemies, whomever
of them He will so regenerate that they may end this life in that faith which worketh by love,
are already, and before this is done, in that predestination His children, and are given to
Christ His Son, that they may not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

<p>Finally, the Saviour Himself says, “If ye continue in my word, ye are indeed my disciples.”
3319 Is Judas, then, to be reckoned among them, since he did not continue in His
word? Are they to be reckoned among them of whom the gospel speaks in such wise, where,
when the Lord had commanded His flesh to be eaten and His blood to be drunk, the Evangelist
says, “These things said He in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum. Many,
therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can
hear it? But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring at it, said to them,
Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascending where He was before?
It is the Spirit that quickeneth, but the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have
spoken unto you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus
knew from the beginning who were the believing ones, and who should betray Him; and
He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man cometh unto me except it were given of my
Father. From this time many of His disciples went away back from Him, and no longer
walked with Him.”3320 Are not these even in the words of the gospel called disciples? And
yet they were not truly disciples, because they did not continue in His word, according to
what He says: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye indeed my disciples.”3321 Because,
therefore, they possessed not perseverance, as not being truly disciples of Christ, so they
were not truly children of God even when they appeared to be so, and were so called. We,
then, call men elected, and Christ’s disciples, and God’s children, because they are to be so
called whom, being regenerated, we see to live piously; but they are then truly what they are
called if they shall abide in that on account of which they are so called. But if they have not
perseverance,—that is, if they continue not in that which they have begun to be,—they are
not truly called what they are called and are not; for they are not this in the sight of Him to
whom it is known what they are going to be,—that is to say, from good men, bad men.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Those Who are Called According to the Purpose Alone are Predestinated.</head>
<p>For this reason the apostle, when he had said, “We know that to those who love God
He worketh all things together for good,”—knowing that some love God, and do not continue
in that good way unto the end,—immediately added, “to them who are the called according
to His purpose.”3322 For these in their love for God continue even to the end; and
they who for a season wander from the way return, that they may continue unto the end
what they had begun to be in good. Showing, however, what it is to be called according to
His purpose, he presently added what I have already quoted above, “Because whom He did
before foreknow, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He
might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them
He also called,” to wit, according to His purpose; “and whom He called, them He also justified;
and whom He justified, them He also glorified.”3323 All those things are already done:
He foreknew, He predestinated, He called, He justified; because both all are already foreknown
and predestinated, and many are already called and justified; but that which he
placed at the end, “them He also glorified” (if, indeed, that glory is here to be understood
of which the same apostle says, “When Christ your life shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with Him in glory”3324), this is not yet accomplished. Although, also, those two things—that
is, He called, and He justified—have not been effected in all of whom they are said,—for
still, even until the end of the world, there remain many to be called and justified,—nevertheless,
He used verbs of the past tense, even concerning things future, as if God had already
arranged from eternity that they should come to pass. For this reason, also, the prophet
Isaiah says concerning Him, “Who has made the things that shall be.”3325 Whosoever,
therefore, in God’s most providential ordering, are foreknown, predestinated, called, justified,
glorified,—I say not, even although not yet born again, but even although not yet born at
all, are already children of God, and absolutely cannot perish. These truly come to Christ,
because they come in such wise as He Himself says, “All that the Father giveth me shall
come to me, and him that cometh to me I will not cast out;”3326 and a little after He says,
“This is the will of the Father who hath sent me, that of all that He hath given me I shall lose
nothing.”3327 From Him, therefore, is given also perseverance in good even to the end; for
it is not given save to those who shall not perish, since they who do not persevere shall perish.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Even the Sins of the Elect are Turned by God to Their Advantage.</head>
<p>To such as love Him, God co-worketh with all things for good; so absolutely all things,
that even if any of them go astray, and break out of the way, even this itself He makes to
avail them for good, so that they return more lowly and more instructed. For they learn that
in the right way3328 itself they ought to rejoice with trembling; not with arrogation to
themselves of confidence of abiding as if by their own strength; not with saying, in their
abundance, “We shall not be moved for ever.”3329 For which reason it is said to them, “Serve
the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling, lest at any time the Lord should be
angry, and ye perish from the right way.”3330 For He does not say, “And ye come not into
the right way;” but He says, “Lest ye perish from the right way.” And what does this show,
but that those who are already walking in the right way are reminded to serve God in fear;
that is, “not to be high-minded, but to fear”?3331 which signifies, that they should not be
haughty, but humble. Whence also He says in another place, “not minding high things, but
consenting with the lowly;”3332 let them rejoice in God, but with trembling; glorying in
none, since nothing is ours, so that he who glorieth may glory in the Lord, lest they perish
from the right way in which they have already begun to walk, while they are ascribing to
themselves their very presence in it. These words also the apostle made use of when he says,
“Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”3333 And setting forth why with
fear and trembling, he says, “For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do for
His good pleasure.”3334 For he had not this fear and trembling who said in his abundance,
“I shall not be moved for ever.”3335 But because he was a child of the promise, not of perdition,
he experienced in God’s desertion for a little while what he himself was: “Lord,” said
he, “in Thy favour Thou gavest strength to my honour; Thou turnedst away Thy face from
me, and I became troubled.”3336 Behold how much better instructed, and for this reason
also more humble, he held on his way, at length seeing and confessing that by His will God
had endowed his honour with strength; and this he had attributed to himself and presumed
to be from himself, in such abundance as God had afforded it, and not from Him who had

given it, and so had said, “I shall not be moved for ever!” Therefore he became troubled so
that he found himself, and being lowly minded learnt not only of eternal life, but, moreover,
of a pious conversation and perseverance in this life, as that in which hope should be
maintained. This might moreover be the word of the Apostle Peter, because he also had said
in his abundance, “I will lay down my life for Thy sake;”3337 attributing to himself, in his
eagerness, what was afterwards to be bestowed on him by his Lord. But the Lord turned
away His face from him, and he became troubled, so that in his fear of dying for Him he
thrice denied Him. But the Lord again turned His face to him, and washed away his sin with
his tears. For what else is, “He turned and looked upon him,”3338 but, He restored to him
the face which, for a little while, He had turned away from him? Therefore he had become
troubled; but because he learned not to be confident concerning himself, even this was of
excellent profit to him, by His agency who co-works for good with all things to those who
love Him; because he had been called according to the purpose, so that no one could pluck
him out of the hand of Christ, to whom he had been given.</p>

<p>Let no one therefore say that a man must not be rebuked when he deviates from the
right way, but that his return and perseverance must only be asked for from the Lord for
him. Let no considerate and believing man say this. For if such an one is called according
to the purpose, beyond all doubt God is co-working for good to him even in the fact of his
being rebuked. But since he who rebukes is ignorant whether he is so called, let him do with
love what he knows ought to be done; for he knows that such an one ought to be rebuked.
God will show either mercy or judgment; mercy, indeed, if he who is rebuked is “made to
differ” by the bestowal of grace from the mass of perdition, and is not found among the
vessels of wrath which are completed for destruction, but among the vessels of mercy which
God has prepared for glory;3339 but judgment, if among the former he is condemned, and

<head>Chapter 26 <del>X.</del>—Whether Adam Received the Gift of Perseverance.</head>
<p>Here arises another question, not reasonably to be slighted, but to be approached and
solved in the help of the Lord in whose hand are both we and our discourses.3340 For I am
asked, in respect of this gift of God which is to persevere in good to the end, what I think
of the first man himself, who assuredly was made upright without any fault. And I do not
say: If he had not perseverance, how was he without fault, seeing that he was in want of so
needful a gift of God? For to this interrogatory the answer is easy, that he had not perseverance,
because he did not persevere in that goodness in which he was without sin; for he
began to have sin from the point at which he fell; and if he began, certainly he was without
sin before he had begun. For it is one thing not to have sin, and it is another not to abide in
that goodness in which there is no sin. Because in that very fact, that he is not said never to
have been without sin, but he is said not to have continued without sin, beyond all doubt it
is demonstrated that he was without sin, seeing that he is blamed for not having continued
in that goodness. But it should rather be asked and discussed with greater pains in what way
we can answer those who say, “If in that uprightness in which he was made without sin he
had perseverance, beyond all doubt he persevered in it; and if he persevered, he certainly
did not sin, and did not forsake that his uprightness. But that he did sin, and was a forsaker
of goodness, the Truth declares. Therefore he had not perseverance in that goodness; and
if he had it not, he certainly received it not. For how should he have both received perseverance,
and not have persevered? Further, if he had it not because he did not receive it, what
sin did he commit by not persevering, if he did not receive perseverance? For it cannot be
said that he did not receive it, for the reason that he was not separated by the bestowal of
grace from the mass of perdition. Because that mass of perdition did not as yet exist in the
human race before he had sinned from whom the corrupted source was derived.”</p>

<pb n="1321"/>
<head>Chapter 27.—The Answer.</head>
<p>Wherefore we most wholesomely confess what we most correctly believe, that the God
and Lord of all things, who in His strength created all things good, and foreknew that evil
things would arise out of good, and knew that it pertained to His most omnipotent goodness
even to do good out of evil things rather than not to allow evil things to be at all, so ordained
the life of angels and men that in it He might first of all show what their free will was capable
of, and then what the kindness of His grace and the judgment of His righteousness was
capable of. Finally, certain angels, of whom the chief is he who is called the devil, became
by free will outcasts from the Lord God. Yet although they fled from His goodness, wherein
they had been blessed, they could not flee from His judgment, by which they were made
most wretched. Others, however, by the same free will stood fast in the truth, and merited
the knowledge of that most certain truth that they should never fall.3341 For if from the Holy
Scriptures we have been able to attain the knowledge that none of the holy angels shall fall
evermore, how much more have they themselves attained this knowledge by the truth more
sublimely revealed to them! Because to us is promised a blessed life without end, and
equality with the angels,3342 from which promise we are certified that when after judgment
we shall have come to that life, we shall not fall from it; but if the angels are ignorant of this
truth concerning themselves, we shall not be their equals, but more blessed than they. But
the Truth has promised us equality with them. It is certain, then, that they have known this
by sight, which we have known by faith, to wit, that there shall be now no more any fall of
any holy angel. But the devil and his angels, although they were blessed before they fell, and
did not know that they should fall unto misery,—there was still something which might be
added to their blessedness, if by free will they had stood in the truth, until they should receive
that fulness of the highest blessing as the reward of that continuance; that is, that by the
great abundance of the love of God, given by the Holy Spirit, they should absolutely not be
able to fall any more, and that they should know this with complete certainty concerning
themselves. They had not this plenitude of blessedness; but since they were ignorant of their
future misery, they enjoyed a blessedness which was less, indeed, but still without any defect.
For if they had known their future fall and eternal punishment, they certainly could not
have been blessed; since the fear of so great an evil as this would compel them even then to
be miserable.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—The First Man Himself Also Might Have Stood by His Free Will.</head>
<p>Thus also He made man with free will; and although ignorant of his future fall, yet
therefore happy, because he thought it was in his own power both not to die and not to become
miserable. And if he had willed by his own free will to continue in this state of uprightness
and freedom from sin, assuredly without any experience of death and of unhappiness
he would have received by the merit of that continuance the fulness of blessing with which
the holy angels also are blessed; that is, the impossibility of falling any more, and the
knowledge of this with absolute certainty. For even he himself could not be blessed although
in Paradise, nay, he would not be there, where it would not become him to be miserable, if
the foreknowledge of his fall had made him wretched with the dread of such a disaster. But
because he forsook God of his free will, he experienced the just judgment of God, that with
his whole race, which being as yet all placed in him had sinned with him, he should be
condemned. For as mary of this race as are delivered by God’s grace are certainly delivered
from the condemnation in which they are already held bound. Whence, even if none should
be delivered, no one could justly blame the judgment of God. That, therefore, in comparison
of those that perish few, but in their absolute number many, are delivered, is effected by
grace,3343 is effected freely:3344 thanks must be given, because it is effected, so that no one
may be lifted up as of his own deservings, but that every mouth may be stopped,3345 and
he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.3346</p>

<p>What then? Did not Adam have the grace of God? Yes, truly, he had it largely, but of a
different kind. He was placed in the midst of benefits which he had received from the
goodness of his Creator; for he had not procured those benefits by his own deservings; in
which benefits he suffered absolutely no evil. But saints in this life, to whom pertains this
grace of deliverance, are in the midst of evils out of which they cry to God, “Deliver us from
evil.” 3347 He in those benefits needed not the death of Christ: these, the blood of that Lamb
absolves from guilt, as well inherited as their own. He had no need of that assistance which
they implore when they say, “I see another law in my members warring against the law of
my mind, and making me captive in the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched
man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through
Jesus Christ our Lord.” 3348 Because in them the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh, and as they labour and are imperilled in such a contest, they ask that
by the grace of Christ the strength to fight and to conquer may be given them. He, however,
tempted and disturbed in no such conflict concerning himself against himself, in that position
of blessedness enjoyed his peace with himself.</p>

<p>Hence, although these do not now require a grace more joyous for the present, they
nevertheless need a more powerful grace; and what grace is more powerful than the onlybegotten
Son of God, equal to the Father and co-eternal, made man for them, and, without
any sin of His own, either original or actual, crucified by men who were sinners? And although
He rose again on the third day, never to die any more, He yet bore death for men
and gave life to the dead, so that redeemed by His blood, having received so great and such
a pledge, they could say, “If God be for us, who is against us? He who spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how has He not with Him also given to us all things?”3349
God therefore took upon Him our nature—that is, the rational soul and flesh of the man
Christ—by an undertaking singularly marvellous, or marvellously singular; so that with no
preceding merits of His own righteousness He might in such wise be the Son of God from
the beginning, in which He had begun to be man, that He, and the Word which is without
beginning, might be one person. For there is no one blinded by such ignorance of this
matter and the Faith as to dare to say that, although born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin
Mary the Son of man, yet of His own free will by righteous living and by doing good works,
without sin, He deserved to be the Son of God; in opposition to the gospel, which says, “The
Word was made flesh.”3350 For where was this made flesh except in the Virginal womb,
whence was the beginning of the man Christ? And, moreover, when the Virgin asked how
that should come to pass which was told her by the angel, the angel answered, “The Holy
Ghost shall come over on to thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee,
therefore that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”3351
“Therefore,” he said; not because of works of which certainly of a yet unborn infant there
are none; but “therefore,” because “the Holy Ghost shall come over on to thee, and the power
of the Highest shall overshadow thee, that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be
called the Son of God.” That nativity, absolutely gratuitous, conjoined, in the unity of the
person, man to God, flesh to the Word! Good works followed that nativity; good works did
not merit it. For it was in no wise to be feared that the human nature taken up by God the
Word in that ineffable manner into a unity of person, would sin by free choice of will, since
that taking up itself was such that the nature of man so taken up by God would admit into
itself no movement of an evil will. Through this Mediator God makes known that He makes
those whom He redeemed by His blood from evil, everlastingly good; and Him He in such

<head>Chapter 31.—The First Man Had Received the Grace Necessary for His Perseverance,
But Its Exercise Was Left in His Free Choice.</head>
<p>The first man had not that grace by which he should never will to be evil; but assuredly
he had that in which if he willed to abide he would never be evil, and without which,
moreover, he could not by free will be good, but which, nevertheless, by free will he could
forsake. God, therefore, did not will even him to be without His grace, which He left in his
free will; because free will is sufficient for evil, but is too little3353 for good, unless it is aided
by Omnipotent Good. And if that man had not forsaken that assistance of his free will, he
would always have been good; but he forsook it, and he was forsaken. Because such was the
nature of the aid, that he could forsake it when he would, and that he could continue in it
if he would; but not such that it could be brought about that he would. This first is the grace
which was given to the first Adam; but more powerful than this is that in the second Adam.
For the first is that whereby it is affected that a man may have righteousness if he will; the
second, therefore, can do more than this, since by it it is even effected that he will, and will
so much, and love with such ardour, that by the will of the Spirit he overcomes the will of
the flesh, that lusteth in opposition to it.3354 Nor was that, indeed, a small grace by which
was demonstrated even the power of free will, because man was so assisted that without this
assistance he could not continue in good, but could forsake this assistance if he would. But
this latter grace is by so much the greater, that it is too little for a man by its means to regain
his lost freedom; it is too little, finally, not to be able without it either to apprehend the good
or to continue in good if he will, unless he is also made to will.</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—The Gifts of Grace Conferred on Adam in Creation.</head>
<p>At that time, therefore, God had given to man a good will,3355 because in that will He
had made him, since He had made him upright. He had given help without which he could
not continue therein if he would; but that he should will, He left in his free will. He could
therefore continue if he would, because the help was not wanting whereby he could, and
without which he could not, perseveringly hold fast the good which he would. But that he
willed not to continue is absolutely the fault of him whose merit it would have been if he
had willed to continue; as the holy angels did, who, while others fell by free will, themselves
by the same free will stood, and deserved to receive the due reward of this continuance—to
wit, such a fulness of blessing that by it they might have the fullest certainty of always abiding
in it. If, however, this help had been wanting, either to angel or to man when they were first
made, since their nature was not made such that without the divine help it could abide if it
would, they certainly would not have fallen by their own fault, because the help would have
been wanting without which they could not continue. At the present time, however, to those
to whom such assistance is wanting, it is the penalty of sin; but to those to whom it is given,
it is given of grace, not of debt; and by so much the more is given through Jesus Christ our
Lord to those to whom it has pleased God to give it, that not only we have that help without
which we cannot continue even if we will, but, moreover, we have so great and such a help
as to will. Because by this grace of God there is caused in us, in the reception of good and
in the persevering hold of it, not only to be able to do what we will, but even to will to do
what we are able. But this was not the case in the first man; for the one of these things was
in him, but the other was not. For he did not need grace to receive good, because he had
not yet lost it; but he needed the aid of grace to continue in it, and without this aid he could
not do this at all; and he had received the ability if he would, but he had not the will for what
he could; for if he had possessed it, he would have persevered. For he could persevere if he
would; but that he would not was the result of free will, which at that time was in such wise
free that he was capable of willing well and ill. For what shall be more free than free will,
when it shall not be able to serve sin? and this should be to man also as it was made to the
holy angels, the reward of deserving. But now that good deserving has been lost by sin, in
those who are delivered that has become the gift of grace which would have been the reward
of deserving.</p>

<p>On which account we must consider with diligence and attention in what respect those
pairs differ from one another,—to be able not to sin, and not to be able to sin; to be able not

good. For the first man was able not to sin, was able not to die, was able not to forsake good.
Are we to say that he who had such a free will could not sin? Or that he to whom it was said,
“If thou shalt sin thou shalt die by death,” could not die? Or that he could not forsake good,
when he would forsake this by sinning, and so die? Therefore the first liberty of the will was
to be able not to sin, the last will be much greater, not to be able to sin; the first immortality
was to be able not to die, the last will be much greater, not to be able to die; the first was the
power of perseverance, to be able not to forsake good—the last will be the felicity of perseverance,
not to be able to forsake good. But because the last blessings will be preferable and
better, were those first ones, therefore, either no blessings at all, or trifling ones?</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—The Aid Without Which a Thing Does Not Come to Pass, and the Aid
with Which a Thing Comes to Pass.</head>
<p>Moreover, the aids themselves are to be distinguished. The aid without which a thing
does not come to pass is one thing, and the aid by which a thing comes to pass is another.
For without food we cannot live; and yet although food should be at hand, it would not
cause a man to live who should will to die. Therefore the aid of food is that without which
it does not come to pass that we live, not that by which it comes to pass that we live. But,
indeed, when the blessedness which a man has not is given him, he becomes at once blessed.
For the aid is not only that without which that does not happen, but also with which that
does happen for the sake of which it is given. Wherefore this is an assistance both by which
it comes to pass, and without which it does not come to pass; because, on the one hand, if
blessedness should be given to a man, he becomes at once blessed; and, on the other, if it
should never be given he will never be so. But food does not of necessity cause a man to live,
and yet without it he cannot live. Therefore to the first man, who, in that good in which he
had been made upright, had received the ability not to sin, the ability not to die, the ability
not to forsake that good itself, was given the aid of perseverance,—not that by which it
should be brought about that he should persevere, but that without which he could not of
free will persevere. But now to the saints predestinated to the kingdom of God by God’s
grace, the aid of perseverance that is given is not such as the former, but such that to them
perseverance itself is bestowed; not only so that without that gift they cannot persevere, but,
moreover, so that by means of this gift they cannot help persevering. For not only did He
say, “Without me ye can do nothing,”3356 but He also said, “Ye have not chosen me, but I
have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your
fruit should remain.”3357 By which words He showed that He had given them not only
righteousness, but perseverance therein. For when Christ thus ordained them that they
should go and bring forth fruit, and that their fruit should remain, who would dare to say,
It shall not remain? Who would dare to say, Perchance it will not remain? “For the gifts and
calling of God are without repentance;”3358 but the calling is of those who are called according
to the purpose. When Christ intercedes, therefore, on behalf of these, that their faith should
not fail, doubtless it will not fail unto the end. And thus it shall persevere even unto the end;
nor shall the end of this life find it anything but continuing.</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—There is a Greater Freedom Now in the Saints Than There Was Before
in Adam.</head>
<p>Certainly a greater liberty is necessary in the face of so many and so great temptations,
which had no existence in Paradise,—a liberty fortified and confirmed by the gift of perseverance,
so that this world, with all its loves, its fears, its errors, may be overcome: the martyrdoms
of the saints have taught this. In fine, he <del>Adam</del>, not only with nobody to make him
afraid, but, moreover, in spite of the authority of God’s fear, using free will, did not stand
in such a state of happiness, in such a facility3359 of <del>not</del> sinning. But these <del>the saints</del>, I
say, not under the fear of the world, but in spite of the rage of the world lest they should
stand, stood firm in the faith; while he could see the good things present which he was going
to forsake, they could not see the good things future which they were going to receive.
Whence is this, save by the gift of Him from whom they obtained mercy to be faithful; from
whom they received the spirit, not of fear, whereby they would yield to the persecutors, but
of power, and of love, and of continence, in which they could overcome all threatenings, all
seductions, all torments? To him, therefore, without any sin, was given the free will with
which he was created; and he made it to serve sin. But although the will of these had been
the servant of sin, it was delivered by Him who said, “If the Son shall make you free, then
shall ye be free indeed.”3360 And by that grace they receive so great a freedom, that although
as long as they live here they are fighting against sinful lusts, and some sins creep upon them
unawares, on account of which they daily say, “Forgive us our debts,”3361 yet they do not
any more obey the sin which is unto death, of which the Apostle John says, “There is a sin
unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.”3362 Concerning which sin (since it is not
expressed) many and different notions may be entertained. I, however, say, that sin is to
forsake even unto death the faith which worketh by love. This sin they no longer serve who
are not in the first condition, as Adam, free; but are freed by the grace of God through the
second Adam, and by that deliverance have that free will which enables them to serve God,
not that by which they may be made captive by the devil. From being made free from sin
they have become the servants of righteousness,3363 in which they will stand till the end, by
the gift to them of perseverance from Him who foreknew them, and predestinated them,
and called them according to His purpose, and justified them, and glorified them, since He
has even already formed those things that are to come which He promised concerning them.

<head>Chapter 36.—God Not Only Foreknows that Men Will Be Good, But Himself Makes
Them So.</head>
<p>It is He Himself, therefore, that makes those men good, to do good works. For He did
not promise them to Abraham because He foreknew that of themselves they would be good.
For if this were the case, what He promised was not His, but theirs. But it was not thus that
Abraham believed, but “he was not weak in faith, giving glory to God;” and “most fully believing
that what He has promised He is able also to perform.”3366 He does not say, “What
He foreknew, He is able to promise;” nor “What He foretold, He is able to manifest;” nor
“What He promised, He is able to foreknow:” but “What He promised, He is able also to
do.” It is He, therefore, who makes them to persevere in good, who makes them good. But
they who fall and perish have never been in the number of the predestinated. Although,
then, the apostle might be speaking of all persons regenerated and living piously when he
said, “Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own master he standeth or
falleth;” yet he at once had regard to the predestinated, and said, “But he shall stand;” and
that they might not arrogate this to themselves, he says, “For God is able to make him
stand.”3367 It is He Himself, therefore, that gives perseverance, who is able to establish those
who stand, so that they may stand fast with the greatest perseverance; or to restore those
who have fallen, for “the Lord setteth up those who are broken down.”3368</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—To a Sound Will is Committed the Power of Persevering or of Not
Persevering.</head>
<p>As, therefore, the first man did not receive this gift of God,—that is, perseverance in
good, but it was left in his choice to persevere or not to persevere, his will had such
strength,—inasmuch as it had been created without any sin, and there was nothing in the
way of concupiscence of himself that withstood it,—that the choice of persevering could
worthily be entrusted to such goodness and to such facility in living well. But God at the
same time foreknew what he would do in unrighteousness; foreknew, however, but did not
compel him to this; but at the same time He knew what He Himself would do in righteousness
concerning him. But now, since that great freedom has been lost by the desert of sin, our
weakness has remained to be aided by still greater gifts. For it pleased God, in order most
effectually to quench the pride of human presumption, “that no flesh should glory in His
presence”—that is, “no man.”3369 But whence should flesh not glory in His presence, save
concerning its merits? Which, indeed, it might have had, but lost; and lost by that very
means whereby it might have had them, that is, by its free will; on account of which there
remains nothing to those who are to be delivered, save the grace of the Deliverer. Thus,
therefore, no flesh glories in His presence. For the unrighteous do not glory, since they have
no ground of glory; nor the righteous, because they have a ground from Him, and have no
glory of theirs, but Himself, to whom they say, “My glory, and the lifter up of my head.”3370
And thus it is that what is written pertains to every man, “that no flesh should glory in His
presence.” To the righteous, however, pertains that Scripture: “He that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord.”3371 For this the apostle most manifestly showed, when, after saying “that
no flesh should glory in His presence,” lest the saints should suppose that they had been left
without any glory, he presently added, “But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is
made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according
as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”3372 Hence it is that in this abode
of miseries, where trial is the life of man upon the earth, “strength is made perfect in weakness.”

<head>Chapter 38.—What is the Nature of the Gift of Perseverance that is Now Given to
the Saints.</head>
<p>And thus God willed that His saints should not—even concerning perseverance in
goodness itself—glory in their own strength, but in Himself, who not only gives them aid
such as He gave to the first man, without which they cannot persevere if they will, but causes
in them also the will; that since they will not persevere unless they both can and will, both
the capability and the will to persevere should be bestowed on them by the liberality of divine
grace. Because by the Holy Spirit their will is so much enkindled that they therefore can,
because they so will; and they therefore so will because God works in them to will. For if in
so much weakness of this life (in which weakness, however, for the sake of checking pride,
strength behoved to be perfected) their own will should be left to themselves, that they
might, if they willed, continue in the help of God, without which they could not persevere,
and God should not work in them to will, in the midst of so many and so great weaknesses
their will itself would give way, and they would not be able to persevere, for the reason that
failing from infirmity they would not will, or in the weakness of will they would not so will
that they would be able. Therefore aid is brought to the infirmity of human will, so that it
might be unchangeably and invincibly3374 influenced by divine grace; and thus, although
weak, it still might not fail, nor be overcome by any adversity. Thus it happens that man’s
will, weak and incapable, in good as yet small, may persevere by God’s strength; while the
will of the first man, strong and healthful, having the power of free choice, did not persevere
in a greater good; because although God’s help was not wanting, without which it could not
persevere if it would, yet it was not such a help as that by which God would work in man
to will. Certainly to the strongest He yielded and permitted to do what He willed; to those
that were weak He has reserved that by His own gift they should most invincibly will what
is good, and most invincibly refuse to forsake this. Therefore when Christ says, “I have
prayed for thee that thy faith fail not,”3375 we may understand that it was said to him who
is built upon the rock. And thus the man of God, not only because he has obtained mercy
to be faithful, but also because faith itself does not fail, if he glories, must glory in the Lord.</p>

and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for God is
able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham,”3376 to show that they were in such
wise to be cut off if they did not produce fruit, that the number which was promised to
Abraham would not be wanting,—is yet more plainly declared in the Apocalypse: “Hold

<head>Chapter 40.—No One is Certain and Secure of His Own Predestination and Salvation.</head>
<p>But, moreover, that such things as these are so spoken to saints who will persevere, as
if it were reckoned uncertain whether they will persevere, is a reason that they ought not
otherwise to hear these things, since it is well for them “not to be high-minded, but to
fear.”3378 For who of the multitude of believers can presume, so long as he is living in this
mortal state, that he is in the number of the predestinated? Because it is necessary that in
this condition that should be kept hidden; since here we have to beware so much of pride,
that even so great an apostle was buffetted by a messenger of Satan, lest he should be lifted
up.3379 Hence it was said to the apostles, “If ye abide in me;”3380 and this He said who knew
for a certainty that they would abide; and through the prophet, “If ye shall be willing, and
will hear me,”3381 although He knew in whom He would work to will also. And many similar
things are said. For on account of the usefulness of this secrecy, lest, perchance, any one
should be lifted up, but that all, even although they are running well, should fear, in that it
is not known who may attain,—on account of the usefulness of this secrecy, it must be believed
that some of the children of perdition, who have not received the gift of perseverance
to the end, begin to live in the faith which worketh by love, and live for some time faithfully
and righteously, and afterwards fall away, and are not taken away from this life before this
happens to them. If this had happened to none of these, men would have that very wholesome
fear, by which the sin of presumption is kept down, only so long as until they should attain
to the grace of Christ by which to live piously, and afterwards would for time to come be
secure that they would never fall away from Him. And such presumption in this condition
of trials is not fitting, where there is so great weakness, that security may engender pride.
Finally, this also shall be the case; but it shall be at that time, in men also as it already is in
the angels, when there cannot be any pride. Therefore the number of the saints, by God’s
grace predestinated to God’s kingdom, with the gift of perseverance to the end bestowed
on them, shall be guided thither in its completeness, and there shall be at length without
end preserved in its fullest completeness, most blessed, the mercy of their Saviour still
cleaving to them, whether in their conversion, in their conflict, or in their crown!</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—Even in Judgment God’s Mercy Will Be Necessary to Us.</head>
<p>For the Holy Scripture testifies that God’s mercy is then also necessary for them, when
the Saint says to his soul concerning the Lord its God, “Who crowneth thee in mercy and
compassion.”3382 The Apostle James also says: “He shall have judgment without mercy who
hath showed no mercy;”3383 where he sets forth that even in that judgment in which the
righteous are crowned and the unrighteous are condemned, some will be judged with mercy,
others without mercy. On which account also the mother of the Maccabees says to her son,
“That in that mercy I may receive thee with thy brethren.”3384 “For when a righteous king,”
as it is written, “shall sit on the throne, no evil thing shall oppose itself to him. Who will
boast that he has a pure heart? or who will boast that he is pure from sin?”3385 And thus
God’s mercy is even then necessary, by which he is made “blessed to whom the Lord has
not imputed sin.”3386 But at that time even mercy itself shall be allotted in righteous judgment
in accordance with the merits of good works. For when it is said, “Judgment without mercy
to him that hath showed no mercy,” it is plainly shown that in those in whom are found the
good works of mercy, judgment shall be executed with mercy; and thus even that mercy itself
shall be returned to the merits of good works. It is not so now; when not only no good works,
but many bad works precede, His mercy anticipates a man so that he is delivered from
evils,—as well from evils which he has done, as from those which he would have done if he
were not controlled by the grace of God; and from those, too, which he would have suffered
for ever if he were not plucked from the power of darkness, and transferred into the kingdom
of the Son of God’s love.3387 Nevertheless, since even that life eternal itself, which, it is certain,
is given as due to good works, is called by so great an apostle the grace of God, although
grace is not rendered to works, but is given freely, it must be confessed without any doubt,
that eternal life is called grace for the reason that it is rendered to those merits which grace
has conferred upon man. Because that saying is rightly understood which in the gospel is
read, “grace for grace,”3388—that is, for those merits which grace has conferred.</p>

<head>Chapter 42.—The Reprobate are to Be Punished for Merits of a Different Kind.</head>
<p>But those who do not belong to this number of the predestinated, whom—whether that
they have not yet any free choice of their will, or with a choice of will truly free, because
freed by grace itself—the grace of God brings to His kingdom,—those, then, who do not
belong to that most certain and blessed number, are most righteously judged according to
their deservings. For either they lie under the sin which they have inherited by original
generation, and depart hence with that inherited debt which is not put away by regeneration,
or by their free will have added other sins besides; their will, I say, free, but not freed,—free
from righteousness, but enslaved to sin, by which they are tossed about by divers mischievous
lusts, some more evil, some less, but all evil; and they must be adjudged to diverse punishments,
according to that very diversity. Or they receive the grace of God, but they are only
for a season, and do not persevere; they forsake and are forsaken. For by their free will, as
they have not received the gift of perseverance, they are sent away by the righteous and
hidden judgment of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 43 <del>XIV.</del>—Rebuke and Grace Do Not Set Aside One Another.</head>
<p>Let men then suffer themselves to be rebuked when they sin, and not conclude against
grace from the rebuke itself, nor from grace against rebuke; because both the righteous
penalty of sin is due, and righteous rebuke belongs to it, if it is medicinally applied, even
although the salvation of the ailing man is uncertain; so that if he who is rebuked belongs
to the number of the predestinated, rebuke may be to him a wholesome medicine; and if he
does not belong to that number, rebuke may be to him a penal infliction. Under that very
uncertainty, therefore, it must of love be applied, although its result is unknown; and prayer
must be made on his behalf to whom it is applied, that he may be healed. But when men
either come or return into the way of righteousness by means of rebuke, who is it that worketh
salvation in their hearts but that God who giveth the increase, whoever plants and waters,
and whoever labours on the fields or shrubs,—that God whom no man’s will resists when
He wills to give salvation? For so to will or not to will is in the power of Him who willeth
or willeth not, as not to hinder the divine will nor overcome the divine power. For even
concerning those who do what He wills not, He Himself does what He will.</p>

<head>Chapter 44.—In What Way God Wills All Men to Be Saved.</head>
<p>And what is written, that “He wills all men to be saved,”3389 while yet all men are not
saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings3390
of mine; but here I will say one thing: “He wills all men to be saved,” is so said that
all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them.
Just as it was said to the Pharisees, “Ye tithe every herb;”3391 where the expression is only
to be understood of every herb that they had, for they did not tithe every herb which was
found throughout the whole earth. According to the same manner of speaking, it was said,
“Even as I also please all men in all things.”3392 For did he who said this please also the
multitude of his persecutors? But he pleased every kind of men that assembled in the Church
of Christ, whether they were already established therein, or were to be introduced into it.</p>

<head>Chapter 45.—Scriptural Instances Wherein It is Proved that God Has Men’s Wills
More in His Power Than They Themselves Have.</head>
<p>It is not, then, to be doubted that men’s wills cannot, so as to prevent His doing what
he wills, withstand the will of God, “who hath done all things whatsoever He pleased in
heaven and in earth,”3393 and who also “has done those things that are to come;”3394 since
He does even concerning the wills themselves of men what He will, when He will. Unless,
perchance (to mention some things among many), when God willed to give the kingdom
to Saul, it was so in the power of the Israelites, as it certainly was placed in their will, either
to subject themselves or not to the man in question, that they could even prevail to withstand
God. God, however, did not do this, save by the will of the men themselves, because he
beyond doubt had the most omnipotent power of inclining men’s hearts whither it pleased
Him. For thus it is written: “And Samuel sent the people away, and every one went away
unto his own place. And Saul went away to his house in Gibeah: and there went away with
Saul mighty men, whose hearts the Lord touched. And pestilent children said, Who shall
save us? This man? And they despised him, and brought him no presents.”3395 Will any
one say that any of those whose hearts the Lord touched to go with Saul would not have
gone with him, or that any of those pestilent fellows, whose hearts He did not touch to do
this, would have gone? Of David also, whom the Lord ordained to the kingdom in a more
prosperous succession, we read thus: “And David continued to increase, and was magnified,
and the Lord was with him.”3396 This having been premised, it is said a little afterwards,
“And the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said, We are thine, O David, and
we will be with thee, O son of Jesse: Peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers;
because the Lord has helped thee.”3397 Could he withstand the will of God, and not rather
do the will of Him who wrought in his heart by His Spirit, with which he was clothed, to
will, speak, and do thus? Moreover, a little afterwards the same Scripture says, “All these
warlike men, setting the battle in array, came with a peaceful heart to Hebron to establish
David over all Israel.”3398 By their own will, certainly, they appointed David king. Who
cannot see this? Who can deny it? For they did not do it under constraint or without goodwill,
since they did it with a peaceful heart. And yet He wrought this in them who worketh
what He will in the hearts of men. For which reason the Scripture premised, “And David
continued to increase, and was magnified, and the Lord Omnipotent was with him.” And

thus the Lord Omnipotent, who was with him, induced these men to appoint him king. And
how did He induce them? Did He constrain thereto by any bodily fetters? He wrought
within; He held their hearts; He stirred their hearts, and drew them by their own wills, which
He Himself wrought in them. If, then, when God wills to set up kings in the earth, He has
the wills of men more in His power than they themselves have, who else causes rebuke to
be wholesome and correction to result in the heart of him that is rebuked, that he may be
established in the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<head>Chapter 46 <del>XV.</del>—Rebuke Must Be Varied According to the Variety of Faults. There
is No Punishment in the Church Greater Than Excommunication.</head>
<p>Therefore, let brethren who are subject be rebuked by those who are set over them, with
rebukes that spring from love, varied according to the diversity of faults, whether smaller
or greater. Because that very penalty that is called condemnation,3399 which episcopal
judgment inflicts, than which there is no greater punishment in the Church, may, if God
will, result and be of advantage for most wholesome rebuke. For we know not what may
happen on the coming day; nor must any one be despaired of before the end of this life; nor
can God be contradicted, that He may not look down and give repentance, and receive the
sacrifice of a troubled spirit and a contrite heart, and absolve from the guilt of condemnation,
however just, and so Himself not condemn the condemned person. Yet the necessity of the
pastoral office requires, in order that the terrible contagion may not creep through the many,
that the diseased sheep should be separated from the sound ones; perchance, by that very
separation, to be healed by Him to whom nothing is impossible. For as we know not who
belongs to the number of the predestinated, we ought in such wise to be influenced by the
affection of love as to will all men to be saved. For this is the case when we endeavour to
lead every individual to that point where they may meet with those agencies by which we
may prevail, to the accomplishment of the result, that being justified by faith they may have
peace with God,3400—which peace, moreover, the apostle announced when he said,
“Therefore, we discharge an embassage for Christ, as though God were exhorting by us, we
pray you in Christ’s stead to be reconciled to God.”3401 For what is “to be reconciled” to
Him but to have peace with Him? For the sake of which peace, moreover, the Lord Jesus
Christ Himself said to His disciples, “Into whatsoever house ye enter first, say, Peace be to
this house; and if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall
return to you again.”3402 When they preach the gospel of this peace of whom it is predicted,
“How beautiful are the feet of those that publish peace, that announce good things!”3403 to
us, indeed, every one then begins to be a son of peace who obeys and believes this gospel,
and who, being justified by faith, has begun to have peace towards God; but, according to
God’s predestination, he was already a son of peace. For it was not said, Upon whomsoever
your peace shall rest, he shall become a son of peace; but Christ says, “If the son of peace be
there, your peace shall rest upon that house.” Already, therefore, and before the announcement
of that peace to him, the son of peace was there, as he had been known and foreknown,

by—not the evangelist, but—God. For we need not fear lest we should lose it, if in our ignorance
he to whom we preach is not a son of peace, for it will return to us again—that is, that
preaching will profit us, and not him; but if the peace proclaimed shall rest upon him, it will
profit both us and him.</p>

<head>Chapter 47.—Another Interpretation of the Apostolic Passage, “Who Will Have All
Men to Be Saved.”</head>
<p>That, therefore, in our ignorance of who shall be saved, God commands us to will that
all to whom we preach this peace may be saved, and Himself works this in us by diffusing
that love in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us,—may also thus be understood,
that God wills all men to be saved, because He makes us to will this; just as “He sent the
Spirit of His Son, crying, Abba, Father;”3404 that is, making us to cry, Abba, Father. Because,
concerning that same Spirit, He says in another place, “We have received the Spirit of adoption,
in whom we cry, Abba, Father!”3405 We therefore cry, but He is said to cry who makes
us to cry. If, then, Scripture rightly said that the Spirit was crying by whom we are made to
cry, it rightly also says that God wills, when by Him we are made to will. And thus, because
by rebuke we ought to do nothing save to avoid departure from that peace which is towards
God, or to induce return to it of him who had departed, let us do in hope what we do. If he
whom we rebuke is a son of peace, our peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it shall return
to us again.</p>

<head>Chapter 48.—The Purpose of Rebuke.</head>
<p>Although, therefore, even while the faith of some is subverted, the foundation of God
standeth sure, since the Lord knoweth them that are His, still, we ought not on that account
to be indolent and negligent in rebuking those who should be rebuked. For not for nothing
was it said, “Evil communications corrupt good manners;”3406 and, “The weak brother shall
perish in thy knowledge, on account of whom Christ died.”3407 Let us not, in opposition to
these precepts, and to a wholesome fear, pretend to argue, saying, “Well, let evil communications
corrupt good manners, and let the weak brother perish. What is that to us? The
foundation of God standeth sure, and no one perishes but the son of perdition.” <del>XVI.</del> Be
it far from us to babble in this wise, and think that we ought to be secure in this negligence.
For it is true that no one perishes except the son of perdition, but God says by the mouth
of the prophet Ezekiel:3408 “He shall surely die in his sin, but his blood will I require at the
hand of the watchman.”</p>

<head>Chapter 49.—Conclusion.</head>
<p>Hence, as far as concerns us, who are not able to distinguish those who are predestinated
from those who are not, we ought on this very account to will all men to be saved. Severe
rebuke should be medicinally applied to all by us that they perish not themselves, or that
they may not be the means of destroying others. It belongs to God, however, to make that
rebuke useful to them whom He Himself has foreknown and predestinated to be conformed
to the image of His Son. For, if at any time we abstain from rebuking, for fear lest by rebuke
a man should perish, why do we not also rebuke, for fear lest a man should rather perish by
our withholding it? For we have no greater bowels of love than the blessed apostle who says,
“Rebuke those that are unruly; comfort the feeble-minded; support the weak; be patient towards
all men. See that none render to any man evil for evil.”3409 Where it is to be understood
that evil is then rather rendered for evil when one who ought to be rebuked is not rebuked,
but by a wicked dissimulation is neglected. He says, moreover, “Them that sin rebuke before
all, that others also may fear;”3410 which must be received concerning those sins which are
not concealed, lest he be thought to have spoken in opposition to the word of the Lord. For
He says, “If thy brother shall sin against thee, rebuke him between thee and him.”3411 Notwithstanding,
He Himself carries out the severity of rebuke to the extent of saying, “If he
will not hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.”3412 And
who has more loved the weak than He who became weak for us all, and of that very weakness
was crucified for us all? And since these things are so, grace neither restrains rebuke, nor
does rebuke restrain grace; and on this account righteousness is so to be prescribed that we
may ask in faithful prayer, that, by God’s grace, what is prescribed may be done; and both
of these things are in such wise to be done that righteous rebuke may not be neglected. But
let all these things be done with love, since love both does not sin, and does cover the multitude
of sins.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<pb n="1349"/>    
<head>A TREATISE ON THE PREDESTINATION OF THE SAINTS,
BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;</head>
<p>The First Book,3413
addressed to prosper and hilary. [3415]</p>
<p>a.d. 428 or 429</p>
<p>Wherein the truth of predestination and grace is defended against the semi-Pelagians,—those
people to wit, who by no means withdraw altogether from the Pelagian heresy, in that
they contend that the beginning of salvation and of faith is of ourselves; so that in virtue,
as it were, of this precedent merit, the other good gifts of God are attained. Augustin shows
that not only the increase, but the very beginning also of faith is in God’s gift. On this
matter he does not disavow that he once thought differently, and that in some small works,
written before his episcopate, he was in error, as in that exposition, which they object to
him, of propositions from the epistle to the Romans. But he points out that he was subsequently
convinced chiefly by this testimony, “but what hast thou that thou hast not received?”
which he proves is to be taken as a testimony concerning faith itself also. He says
that faith is to be counted among other works, which the apostle denies to anticipate God’s
grace when He says, “not of works.” He declares that the hardness of the heart is taken
away by grace, and that all come to Christ who are taught to come by the Father; but that
those whom He teaches, He teaches in mercy, while those whom He teaches not, in judgment
He teaches not. That the passage from his hundred and second epistle, Question 2,
“concerning the time of the Christian religion” which is alleged by the semi-Pelagians,
may rightly be explained without detriment to the doctrine of grace and predestination.
He teaches what is the difference between grace and predestination. Further, he says that
God in his predestination foreknew what he had purposed to do. He marvels greatly that
the adversaries of predestination, who are said to be unwilling to be dependent on the
uncertainty of God’s will, prefer rather to trust themselves to their own weakness than to
the strength of God’s promise. He clearly points out that they abuse this authority, “If thou
believest, thou shalt be saved.” That the truth of grace and perseverance shines forth in
the case of infants that are saved, who are distinguished by no merits of their own from
others who perish. For that there is no difference between them arising from the foreknowledge
of merits which they would have had if they had lived longer. That testimony is
<note type="footnote">3413 This Treatise is the first portion of a work, of which the following, On the Gift of Perseverance, is the
second.</note>

<pb n="1350"/>
wrongfully rejected by the adversaries as being uncanonical, which he adduced for the
purpose of this discussion, “he was taken away lest wickedness,” etc. That the most illustrious
instance of predestination and grace is the Saviour Himself, in whom a man obtained
the privilege of being the Saviour and the Only-begotten Son of God, through being assumed
into oneness of person by the Word co-eternal with the Father, on account of no precedent
merits, either of works or of faith. That the predestinated are called by some certain calling
peculiar to the elect, and that they have been elected before the foundation of the world;
not because they were foreknown as men who would believe and would be holy, but in
order that by means of that very election of grace they might be such, etc.</p>

<p>We know that in the Epistle to the Philippians the apostle said, “To write the same things
to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe;”3414 yet the same apostle writing
to the Galatians when he saw that he had done enough among them of what he regarded as
being needful for them, by the ministry of his preaching, said, “For the rest let no man cause
me labour,”3415 or as it is read in many codices, “Let no one be troublesome to me.” But
although I confess that it causes me trouble that the divine word in which the grace of God
is preached (which is absolutely no grace if it is given according to our merits), great and
manifest as it is, is not yielded to, nevertheless my dearest sons, Prosper and Hilary, your
zeal and brotherly affection—which makes you so reluctant to see any of the brethren in
error, as to wish that, after so many books and letters of mine on this subject, I should write
again from here—I love more than I can tell, although I do not dare to say that I love it as
much as I ought. Wherefore, behold, I write to you again. And although not with you, yet
through you I am still doing what I thought I had done sufficiently.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—To What Extent the Massilians3416 Withdraw from the Pelagians.</head>
<p>For on consideration of your letters, I seem to see that those brethren on whose behalf
you exhibit a pious care that they may not hold the poetical opinion in which it is affirmed,
“Every one is a hope for himself,”3417 and so fall under that condemnation which is, not
poetically, but prophetically, declared, “Cursed is every man that hath hope in man,”3418
must be treated in that way wherein the apostle dealt with those to whom he said, “And if
in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.”3419 For as yet
they are in darkness on the question concerning the predestination of the saints, but they
have that whence, “if in anything they are otherwise minded, God will reveal even this unto
them,” if they are walking in that to which they have attained. For which reason the apostle,
when he had said, “If ye are in anything otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
you,” says, “Nevertheless whereunto we have attained, let us walk in the same.” 3420 And
those brethren of ours, on whose behalf your pious love is solicitous, have attained with
Christ’s Church to the belief that the human race is born obnoxious to the sin of the first
man, and that none can be delivered from that evil save by the righteousness of the Second
Man. Moreover, they have attained to the confession that men’s wills are anticipated by
God’s grace; and to the agreement that no one can suffice to himself either for beginning
or for completing any good work. These things, therefore, unto which they have attained,
being held fast, abundantly distinguish them from the error of the Pelagians. Further, if they
walk in them, and beseech Him who giveth understanding, if in anything concerning predestination
they are otherwise minded, He will reveal even this unto them. Yet let us also
spend upon them the influence of our love, and the ministry of our discourse, according to
His gift, whom we have asked that in these letters we might say what should be suitable3421
and profitable to them. For whence do we know whether by this our service, wherein we
are serving them in the free love of Christ, our God may not perchance will to effect that
purpose?</p>

<head>Chapter 3 <del>II.</del>—Even the Beginning of Faith is of God’s Gift.</head>
<p>Therefore I ought first to show that the faith by which we are Christians is the gift of
God, if I can do that more thoroughly than I have already done in so many and so large
volumes. But I see that I must now reply to those who say that the divine testimonies which
I have adduced concerning this matter are of avail for this purpose, to assure us that we
have faith itself of ourselves, but that its increase is of God; as if faith were not given to us
by Him, but were only increased in us by Him, on the ground of the merit of its having begun
from us. Thus there is here no departure from that opinion which Pelagius himself was
constrained to condemn in the judgment of the bishops of Palestine, as is testified in the
same Proceedings, “That the grace of God is given according to our merits,”3422 if it is not
of God’s grace that we begin to believe, but rather that on account of this beginning an addition
is made to us of a more full and perfect belief; and so we first give the beginning of
our faith to God, that His supplement may also be given to us again, and whatever else we
faithfully ask.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Continuation of the Preceding.</head>
<p>But why do we not in opposition to this, rather hear the words, “Who hath first given
to Him and it shall be recompensed to him again? since of Him, and through Him, and in
Him, are all things.”3423 And from whom, then, is that very beginning of our faith if not
from Him? For this is not excepted when other things are spoken of as of Him; but “of Him,
and through Him, and in Him, are all things.” But who can say that he who has already begun
to believe deserves nothing from Him in whom he has believed? Whence it results that, to
him who already deserves, other things are said to be added by a divine retribution, and
thus that God’s grace is given according to our merits. And this assertion when put before
him, Pelagius himself condemned, that he might not be condemned. Whoever, then, wishes
on every side to avoid this condemnable opinion, let him understand that what the apostle
says is said with entire truthfulness, “Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to
believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.”3424 He shows that both are the gifts of God,
because he said that both were given. And he does not say, “to believe on Him more fully
and perfectly,” but, “to believe on Him.” Neither does he say that he himself had obtained
mercy to be more faithful, but “to be faithful,”3425 because he knew that he had not first
given the beginning of his faith to God, and had its increase given back to him again by
Him; but that he had been made faithful by God, who also had made him an apostle. For
the beginnings of his faith are recorded, and they are very well known by being read in the
church on an occasion calculated to distinguish them:3426 how, being turned away from
the faith which he was destroying, and being vehemently opposed to it, he was suddenly by
a more powerful grace converted to it, by the conversion of Him, to whom as One who
would do this very thing it was said by the prophet, “Thou wilt turn and quicken us;”3427
so that not only from one who refused to believe he was made a willing believer, but,
moreover, from being a persecutor, he suffered persecution in defence of that faith which
he persecuted. Because it was given him by Christ “not only to believe on Him, but also to
suffer for His sake.”</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—To Believe is to Think with Assent.</head>
<p>And, therefore, commending that grace which is not given according to any merits, but
is the cause of all good merits, he says, “Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of
ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.”3428 Let them give attention to this, and well weigh
these words, who think that the beginning of faith is of ourselves, and the supplement of
faith is of God. For who cannot see that thinking is prior to believing? For no one believes
anything unless he has first thought that it is to be believed. For however suddenly, however
rapidly, some thoughts fly before the will to believe, and this presently follows in such wise
as to attend them, as it were, in closest conjunction, it is yet necessary that everything which
is believed should be believed after thought has preceded; although even belief itself is
nothing else than to think with assent. For it is not every one who thinks that believes, since
many think in order that they may not believe; but everybody who believes, thinks,—both
thinks in believing and believes in thinking. Therefore in what pertains to religion and piety
(of which the apostle was speaking), if we are not capable of thinking anything as of ourselves,
but our sufficiency is of God, we are certainly not capable of believing anything as of
ourselves, since we cannot do this without thinking; but our sufficiency, by which we begin
to believe, is of God. Wherefore, as no one is sufficient for himself, for the beginning or the
completion of any good work whatever,—and this those brethren of yours, as what you have
written intimates, already agree to be true, whence, as well in the beginning as in the carrying
out of every good work, our sufficiency is of God,—so no one is sufficient for himself, either
to begin or to perfect faith; but our sufficiency is of God. Because if faith is not a matter of
thought, it is of no account; and we are not sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but
our sufficiency is of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Presumption and Arrogance to Be Avoided.</head>
<p>Care must be taken, brethren, beloved of God, that a man do not lift himself up in opposition
to God, when he says that he does what God has promised. Was not the faith of
the nations promised to Abraham, “and he, giving glory to God, most fully believed that
what He promised He is able also to perform”?3429 He therefore makes the faith of the nations,
who is able to do what He has promised. Further, if God works our faith, acting in a
wonderful manner in our hearts so that we believe, is there any reason to fear that He cannot
do the whole; and does man on that account arrogate to himself its first elements, that he
may merit to receive its last from God? Consider if in such a way any other result be gained
than that the grace of God is given in some way or other, according to our merit, and so
grace is no more grace. For on this principle it is rendered as debt, it is not given gratuitously;
for it is due to the believer that his faith itself should be increased by the Lord, and that the
increased faith should be the wages of the faith begun; nor is it observed when this is said,
that this wage is assigned to believers, not of grace, but of debt. And I do not at all see why
the whole should not be attributed to man,—as he who could originate for himself what he
had not previously, can himself increase what he had originated,—except that it is impossible
to withstand the most manifest divine testimony by which faith, whence piety takes its beginning,
is shown also to be the gift of God: such as is that testimony that “God hath dealt
to every man the measure of faith;”3430 and that one, “Peace be to the brethren, and love
with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ,”3431 and other similar passages.
Man, therefore, unwilling to resist such clear testimonies as these, and yet desiring himself
to have the merit of believing, compounds as it were with God to claim a portion of faith
for himself, and to leave a portion for Him; and, what is still more arrogant, he takes the
first portion for himself and gives the subsequent to Him; and so in that which he says belongs
to both, he makes himself the first, and God the second!</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>III.</del>—Augustin Confesses that He Had Formerly Been in Error Concerning
the Grace of God.</head>
<p>It was not thus that that pious and humble teacher thought—I speak of the most blessed
Cyprian—when he said “that we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.”3432 And
in order to show this, he appealed to the apostle as a witness, where he said, “For what hast
thou that thou hast not received? And if thou hast received it, why boastest thou as if thou
hadst not received it?”3433 And it was chiefly by this testimony that I myself also was convinced
when I was in a similar error, thinking that faith whereby we believe on God is not
God’s gift, but that it is in us from ourselves, and that by it we obtain the gifts of God,
whereby we may live temperately and righteously and piously in this world. For I did not
think that faith was preceded by God’s grace, so that by its means would be given to us what
we might profitably ask, except that we could not believe if the proclamation of the truth
did not precede; but that we should consent when the gospel was preached to us I thought
was our own doing, and came to us from ourselves. And this my error is sufficiently indicated
in some small works of mine written before my episcopate. Among these is that which you
have mentioned in your letters3434 wherein is an exposition of certain propositions from
the Epistle to the Romans. Eventually, when I was retracting all my small works, and was
committing that retractation to writing, of which task I had already completed two books
before I had taken up your more lengthy letters,—when in the first volume I had reached
the retractation of this book, I then spoke thus:—“Also discussing, I say, ‘what God could
have chosen in him who was as yet unborn, whom He said that the elder should serve; and
what in the same elder, equally as yet unborn, He could have rejected; concerning whom,
on this account, the prophetic testimony is recorded, although declared long subsequently,
“Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,”’3435 I carried out my reasoning to the point of
saying: ‘God did not therefore choose the works of any one in foreknowledge of what He
Himself would give them, but he chose the faith, in the foreknowledge that He would choose
that very person whom He foreknew would believe on Him,—to whom He would give the
Holy Spirit, so that by doing good works he might obtain eternal life also.’ I had not yet very
carefully sought, nor had I as yet found, what is the nature of the election of grace, of which
the apostle says, ‘A remnant are saved according to the election of grace.’3436 Which assuredly
is not grace if any merits precede it; lest what is now given, not according to grace, but according
to debt, be rather paid to merits than freely given. And what I next subjoined: ‘For

the same apostle says, “The same God which worketh all in all;”3437 but it was never said,
God believeth all in all;’ and then added, ‘Therefore what we believe is our own, but what
good thing we do is of Him who giveth the Holy Spirit to them that believe:’ I certainly could
not have said, had I already known that faith itself also is found among those gifts of God
which are given by the same Spirit. Both, therefore, are ours on account of the choice of the
will, and yet both are given by the spirit of faith and love. For faith is not alone but as it is
written, ‘Love with faith, from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.’3438 And what I
said a little after, ‘For it is ours to believe and to will, but it is His to give to those who believe
and will, the power of doing good works through the Holy Spirit, by whom love is shed
abroad in our hearts,’—is true indeed; but by the same rule both are also God’s, because
God prepares the will; and both are ours too, because they are only brought about with our
good wills. And thus what I subsequently said also: ‘Because we are not able to will unless
we are called; and when, after our calling, we would will, our willing is not sufficiently nor
our running, unless God gives strength to us that run, and leads us whither He calls us;’ and
thereupon added: ‘It is plain, therefore, that it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that showeth mercy, that we do good works’—this is absolutely most
true. But I discovered little concerning the calling itself, which is according to God’s purpose;
for not such is the calling of all that are called, but only of the elect. Therefore what I said a
little afterwards: ‘For as in those whom God elects it is not works but faith that begins the
merit so as to do good works by the gift of God, so in those whom He condemns, unbelief
and impiety begin the merit of punishment, so that even by way of punishment itself they
do evil works’—I spoke most truly. But that even the merit itself of faith was God’s gift, I
neither thought of inquiring into, nor did I say. And in another place I say: ‘For whom He
has mercy upon, He makes to do good works, and whom He hardeneth He leaves to do evil
works; but that mercy is bestowed upon the preceding merit of faith, and that hardening is
applied to preceding iniquity.’ And this indeed is true; but it should further have been asked,
whether even the merit of faith does not come from God’s mercy,—that is, whether that
mercy is manifested in man only because he is a believer, or whether it is also manifested
that he may be a believer? For we read in the apostle’s words: ‘I obtained mercy to be a believer.’
3439 He does not say, ‘Because I was a believer.’ Therefore although it is given to the
believer, yet it has been given also that he may be a believer. Therefore also, in another place
in the same book I most truly said: ‘Because, if it is of God’s mercy, and not of works, that
we are even called that we may believe and it is granted to us who believe to do good works,

that mercy must not be grudged to the heathen;’—although I there discoursed less carefully

<head>Chapter 8 <del>IV.</del>—What Augustin Wrote to Simplicianus, the Successor of Ambrose,
Bishop of Milan.</head>
<p>You see plainly what was at that time my opinion concerning faith and works, although
I was labouring in commending God’s grace; and in this opinion I see that those brethren
of ours now are, because they have not been as careful to make progress with me in my
writings as they were in reading them. For if they had been so careful, they would have found
that question solved in accordance with the truth of the divine Scriptures in the first book
of the two which I wrote in the very beginning of my episcopate to Simplicianus, of blessed
memory, Bishop of the Church of Milan, and successor to St. Ambrose. Unless, perchance,
they may not have known these books; in which case, take care that they do know them. Of
this first of those two books, I first spoke in the second book of the Retractations; and what
I said is as follows: “Of the books, I say, on which, as a bishop, I have laboured, the first two
are addressed to Simplicianus, president of the Church of Milan, who succeeded the most
blessed Ambrose, concerning divers questions, two of which I gathered into the first book
from the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans. The former of them is about what is
written: ‘What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? By no means;’3441 as far as the passage
where he says, ‘Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through
Jesus Christ our Lord.’3442 And therein I have expounded those words of the apostle: ‘The
law is spiritual; but I am carnal,’3443 and others in which the flesh is declared to be in conflict
against the Spirit in such a way as if a man were there described as still under law, and not
yet established under grace. For, long afterwards, I perceived that those words might even
be (and probably were) the utterance of a spiritual man. The latter question in this book is
gathered from that passage where the apostle says, ‘And not only this, but when Rebecca
also had conceived by one act of intercourse, even by our father Isaac,’3444 as far as that
place where he says, ‘Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we should be as Sodoma,
and should have been like unto Gomorrah.’3445 In the solution of this question I laboured
indeed on behalf of the free choice of the human will, but God’s grace overcame, and I could
only reach that point where the apostle is perceived to have said with the most evident truth,
‘For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou hast not received? Now, if
thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou receivedst it not?’3446 And this the
martyr Cyprian was also desirous of setting forth when he compressed the whole of it in

that title: ‘That we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.’”3447 This is why I
previously said that it was chiefly by this apostolic testimony that I myself had been convinced,
when I thought otherwise concerning this matter; and this God revealed to me as I
sought to solve this question when I was writing, as I said, to the Bishop Simplicianus. This
testimony, therefore, of the apostle, when for the sake of repressing man’s conceit he said,
“For what hast thou which thou hast not received?”3448 does not allow any believer to say,
I have faith which I received not. All the arrogance of this answer is absolutely repressed by
these apostolic words. Moreover, it cannot even be said, “Although I have not a perfected
faith, yet I have its beginning, whereby I first of all believed in Christ.” Because here also is
answered: “But what hast thou that thou hast not received? Now, if thou hast received it,
why dost thou glory as if thou receivedst it not?”

<head>Chapter 9 <del>V.</del>—The Purpose of the Apostle in These Words.</head>
<p>The notion, however, which they entertain, “that these words, ‘What hast thou that thou
hast not received?’ cannot be said of this faith, because it has remained in the same nature,
although corrupted, which at first was endowed with health and perfection,”3449 is perceived
to have no force for the purpose that they desire if it be considered why the apostle said
these words. For he was concerned that no one should glory in man, because dissensions
had sprung up among the Corinthian Christians, so that every one was saying, “I, indeed,
am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, and another, I am of Cephas;”3450 and thence he
went on to say: “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and
God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the strong things; and God hath
chosen the ignoble things of the world, and contemptible things, and those things which
are not, to make of no account things which are; that no flesh should glory before God.”3451
Here the intention of the apostle is of a certainty sufficiently plain against the pride of man,
that no one should glory in man; and thus, no one should glory in himself. Finally, when
he had said “that no flesh should glory before God,” in order to show in what man ought
to glory, he immediately added, “But it is of Him that ye are in Christ Jesus, who is made
unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that according
as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”3452 Thence that intention
of his progressed, till afterwards rebuking them he says, “For ye are yet carnal; for whereas
there are among you envying and contention, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?
For while one saith I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not men? What, then,
is Apollos, and what Paul? Ministers by whom you believed; and to every one as the Lord
has given. I have planted, and Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. Therefore, neither
is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.”3453 Do
you not see that the sole purpose of the apostle is that man may be humbled, and God alone
exalted? Since in all those things, indeed, which are planted and watered, he says that not
even are the planter and the waterer anything, but God who giveth the increase: and the
very fact, also, that one plants and another waters he attributes not to themselves, but to
God, when he says, “To every one as the Lord hath given; I have planted, Apollos watered.”
Hence, therefore, persisting in the same intention he comes to the point of saying, “Therefore
let no man glory in man,”3454 for he had already said, “He that glorieth, let him glory in the

Lord.” After these and some other matters which are associated therewith, that same intention
of his is carried on in the words: “And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred
to myself and to Apollos for your sakes, that ye might learn in us that no one of you should
be puffed up for one against another above that which is written. For who maketh thee to
differ? And what hast thou which thou hast not received? Now, if thou hast received it, why
dost thou glory as if thou receivedst it not?”3455</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—It is God’s Grace Which Specially Distinguishes One Man from Another.</head>
<p>In this the apostle’s most evident intention, in which he speaks against human pride,
so that none should glory in man but in God, it is too absurd, as I think, to suppose God’s
natural gifts, whether man’s entire and perfected nature itself as it was bestowed on him in
his first state, or the remains, whatever they may be, of his degraded nature. For is it by such
gifts as these, which are common to all men, that men are distinguished from men? But here
he first said, “For who maketh thee to differ?” and then added, “And what hast thou that
thou hast not received?” Because a man, puffed up against another, might say, “My faith
makes me to differ,” or “My righteousness,” or anything else of the kind. In reply to such
notions, the good teacher says, “But what hast thou that thou hast not received?” And from
whom but from Him who maketh thee to differ from another, on whom He bestowed not
what He bestowed on thee? “Now if,” says he, “thou hast received it, why dost thou glory
as if thou receivedst it not?” Is he concerned, I ask, about anything else save that he who
glorieth should glory in the Lord? But nothing is so opposed to this feeling as for any one
to glory concerning his own merits in such a way as if he himself had made them for himself,
and not the grace of God,—a grace, however, which makes the good to differ from the
wicked, and is not common to the good and the wicked. Let the grace, therefore, whereby
we are living and reasonable creatures, and are distinguished from cattle, be attributed to
nature; let that grace also by which, among men themselves, the handsome are made to
differ from the ill-formed, or the intelligent from the stupid, or anything of that kind, be
ascribed to nature. But he whom the apostle was rebuking did not puff himself up as contrasted
with cattle, nor as contrasted with any other man, in respect of any natural endowment
which might be found even in the worst of men. But he ascribed to himself, and not to God,
some good gift which pertained to a holy life, and was puffed up therewith when he deserved
to hear the rebuke, “Who hath made thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou receivedst
not?” For though the capacity to have faith is of nature, is it also of nature to have it? “For
all men have not faith,”3456 although all men have the capacity to have faith. But the apostle
does not say, “And what hast thou capacity to have, the capacity to have which thou receivedst
not?” but he says, “And what hast thou which thou receivedst not?” Accordingly, the capacity
to have faith,3457 as the capacity to have love, belongs to men’s nature; but to have faith,
even as to have love, belongs to the grace of believers. That nature, therefore, in which is
given to us the capacity of having faith, does not distinguish man from man, but faith itself

makes the believer to differ from the unbeliever. And thus, when it is said, “For who maketh
thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou receivedst not?” if any one dare to say, “I have
faith of myself, I did not, therefore, receive it,” he directly contradicts this most manifest
truth,—not because it is not in the choice of man’s will to believe or not to believe, but because
in the elect the will is prepared by the Lord. Thus, moreover, the passage, “For who maketh
thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou receivedst not?” refers to that very faith which
is in the will of man.</p>

<head>Chapter 11 <del>VI.</del>—That Some Men are Elected is of God’s Mercy.</head>
<p>“Many hear the word of truth; but some believe, while others contradict. Therefore, the
former will to believe; the latter do not will.” Who does not know this? Who can deny this?
But since in some the will is prepared by the Lord, in others it is not prepared, we must assuredly
be able to distinguish what comes from God’s mercy, and what from His judgment.
“What Israel sought for,” says the apostle, “he hath not obtained, but the election hath obtained
it; and the rest were blinded, as it is written, God gave to them the spirit of compunction,—
eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, even to this day.
And David said, Let their table be made a snare, a retribution, and a stumblingblock to them;
let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see; and bow down their back always.”3458
Here is mercy and judgment,—mercy towards the election which has obtained the righteousness
of God, but judgment to the rest which have been blinded. And yet the former, because
they willed,3459 believed; the latter, because they did not will believed not. Therefore mercy
and judgment were manifested in the very wills themselves. Certainly such an election is of
grace, not at all of merits. For he had before said, “So, therefore, even at this present time,
the remnant has been saved by the election of grace. And if by grace, now it is no more of
works; otherwise grace is no more grace.”3460 Therefore the election obtained what it obtained
gratuitously; there preceded none of those things which they might first give, and it should
be given to them again. He saved them for nothing. But to the rest who were blinded, as is
there plainly declared, it was done in recompense. “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and
truth.”3461 But His ways are unsearchable. Therefore the mercy by which He freely delivers,
and the truth by which He righteously judges, are equally unsearchable.</p>

<head>Chapter 12 <del>VII.</del>—Why the Apostle Said that We are Justified by Faith and Not by
Works.</head>
<p>But perhaps it may be said: “The apostle distinguishes faith from works; he says, indeed,
that grace is not of works, but he does not say that it is not of faith.” This, indeed, is true.
But Jesus says that faith itself also is the work of God, and commands us to work it. For the
Jews said to Him, “What shall we do that we may work the work of God? Jesus answered,
and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.”
3462 The apostle, therefore, distinguishes faith from works, just as Judah is distinguished
from Israel in the two kingdoms of the Hebrews, although Judah is Israel itself. And he says
that a man is justified by faith and not by works, because faith itself is first given, from which
may be obtained other things which are specially characterized as works, in which a man
may live righteously. For he himself also says, “By grace ye are saved through faith; and this
not of yourselves; but it is the gift of God,”3463—that is to say, “And in saying ‘through faith,’
even faith itself is not of yourselves, but is God’s gift.” “Not of works,” he says, “lest any man
should be lifted up.” For it is often said, “He deserved to believe, because he was a good man
even before he believed.” Which may be said of Cornelius3464 since his alms were accepted
and his prayers heard before he had believed on Christ; and yet without some faith he neither
gave alms nor prayed. For how did he call on him on whom he had not believed? But if he
could have been saved without the faith of Christ the Apostle Peter would not have been
sent as an architect to build him up; although, “Except the Lord build the house, they labour
in vain who build it.”3465 And we are told, Faith is of ourselves; other things which pertain
to works of righteousness are of the Lord; as if faith did not belong to the building,—as if,
I say, the foundation did not belong to the building. But if this primarily and especially belongs
to it, he labours in vain who seeks to build up the faith by preaching, unless the Lord
in His mercy builds it up from within. Whatever, therefore, of good works Cornelius performed,
as well before he believed in Christ as when he believed and after he had believed,
are all to be ascribed to God, lest, perchance any man be lifted up.</p>

a little afterwards in that same discourse of His, “I said unto you that ye also have seen me
and have not believed. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.”3466 What is the
meaning of “shall come to me,” but, “shall believe in me”? But it is the Father’s gift that this
may be the case. Moreover, a little after He says, “Murmur not among yourselves. No one
can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him; and I will raise him up at
the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all teachable3467 of God. Every
man that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me.”3468 What is the
meaning of, “Every man that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto
me,” except that there is none who hears from the Father, and learns, who cometh not to
me? For if every one who has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes, certainly every
one who does not come has not heard from the Father; for if he had heard and learned, he
would come. For no one has heard and learned, and has not come; but every one, as the
Truth declares, who has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes. Far removed from
the senses of the flesh is this teaching in which the Father is heard, and teaches to come to
the Son. Engaged herein is also the Son Himself, because He is His Word by which He thus
teaches; and He does not do this through the ear of the flesh, but of the heart. Herein engaged,
also, at the same time, is the Spirit of the Father and of the Son; and He, too, teaches, and
does not teach separately, since we have learned that the workings of the Trinity are insep-
arable. And that is certainly the same Holy Spirit of whom the apostle says, “We, however,
having the same Spirit of faith.”3469 But this is especially attributed to the Father, for the
reason that of Him is begotten the Only Begotten, and from Him proceeds the Holy Spirit,
of which it would be tedious to argue more elaborately; and I think that my work in fifteen
books on the Trinity which God is, has already reached you. Very far removed, I say, from
the senses of the flesh is this instruction wherein God is heard and teaches. We see that
many come to the Son because we see that many believe on Christ, but when and how they
have heard this from the Father, and have learned, we see not. It is true that that grace is
exceedingly secret, but who doubts that it is grace? This grace, therefore, which is hiddenly
bestowed in human hearts by the Divine gift, is rejected by no hard heart, because it is given
for the sake of first taking away the hardness of the heart. When, therefore, the Father is
heard within, and teaches, so that a man comes to the Son, He takes away the heart of stone

<head>Chapter 14.—Why the Father Does Not Teach All that They May Come to Christ.</head>
<p>Why, then, does He not teach all that they may come to Christ, except because all whom
He teaches, He teaches in mercy, while those whom He teaches not, in judgment He teaches
not? Since, “On whom He will He has mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.”3470 But
He has mercy when He gives good things. He hardens when He recompenses what is deserved.
Or if, as some would prefer to distinguish them, those words also are his to whom
the apostle says, “Thou sayest then unto me,” so that he may be regarded as having said,
“Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardeneth,” as well as
those which follow,—to wit, “What is it that is still complained of? for who resists His will?”
does the apostle answer, “O man, what thou hast said is false?” No; but he says, “O man,
who art thou that repliest against God? Doth the thing formed say to him that formed it,
Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump?”3471
and what follows, which you very well know. And yet in a certain sense the Father teaches
all men to come to His Son. For it was not in vain that it was written in the prophets, “And
they shall all be teachable of God.”3472 And when He too had premised this testimony, He
added, “Every man, therefore, who has heard of the Father, and has learned, cometh to me.”
As, therefore, we speak justly when we say concerning any teacher of literature who is alone
in a city, He teaches literature here to everybody,—not that all men learn, but that there is
none who learns literature there who does not learn from him,—so we justly say, God teaches
all men to come to Christ, not because all come, but because none comes in any other way.
And why He does not teach all men the apostle explained, as far as he judged that it was to
be explained, because, “willing to show His wrath, and to exhibit His power, He endured
with much patience the vessels of wrath which were perfected for destruction; and that He
might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared
for glory.”3473 Hence it is that the “word of the cross is foolishness to them that perish; but
unto them that are saved it is the power of God.”3474 God teaches all such to come to Christ,
for He wills all such to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. And if He had
willed to teach even those to whom the word of the cross is foolishness to come to Christ,
beyond all doubt these also would have come. For He neither deceives nor is deceived when
He says, “Everyone that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to me.” Away,
then, with the thought that any one cometh not, who has heard of the Father and has learned.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—It is Believers that are Taught of God.</head>
<p>“Why,” say they, “does He not teach all men?” If we should say that they whom He does
not teach are unwilling to learn, we shall be met with the answer: And what becomes of
what is said to Him, “O God, Thou wilt turn us again, and quicken us”?3475 Or if God does
not make men willing who were not willing, on what principle does the Church pray, according
to the Lord’s commandment, for her persecutors? For thus also the blessed Cyprian3476
would have it to be understood that we say, “Thy will be done, as in heaven so in
earth,”—that is, as in those who have already believed, and who are, as it were, heaven, so
also in those who do not believe, and on this account are still the earth. What, then, do we
pray for on behalf of those who are unwilling to believe, except that God would work in
them to will also? Certainly the apostle says, “Brethren, my heart’s good will, indeed, and
my prayer to God for them, is for their salvation.”3477 He prays for those who do not be-
lieve,—for what, except that they may believe? For in no other way do they obtain salvation.
If, then, the faith of the petitioners precede the grace of God, does the faith of them on whose
behalf prayer is made that they may believe precede the grace of God?—since this is the very
thing that is besought for them, that on them that believe not—that is, who have not
faith—faith itself may be bestowed? When, therefore, the gospel is preached, some believe,
some believe not; but they who believe at the voice of the preacher from without, hear of
the Father from within, and learn; while they who do not believe, hear outwardly, but inwardly
do not hear nor learn;—that is to say, to the former it is given to believe; to the latter
it is not given. Because “no man,” says He, “cometh to me, except the Father which sent me
draw him.”3478 And this is more plainly said afterwards. For after a little time, when He was
speaking of eating his flesh and drinking His blood, and some even of His disciples said,
“This is a hard saying, who can hear it? Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples murmured
at this, said unto them, Doth this offend you?”3479 And a little after He said, “The
words that I have spoken unto you are spirit and life; but there are some among you which
believe not.”3480 And immediately the evangelist says, “For Jesus knew from the beginning
who were the believers, and who should betray Him; and He said, Therefore said I unto
you, that no man can come unto me except it were given him of my Father.” Therefore, to
be drawn to Christ by the Father, and to hear and learn of the Father in order to come to
Christ, is nothing else than to receive from the Father the gift by which to believe in Christ.

<head>Chapter 16.—Why the Gift of Faith is Not Given to All.</head>
<p>Faith, then, as well in its beginning as in its completion, is God’s gift; and let no one
have any doubt whatever, unless he desires to resist the plainest sacred writings, that this
gift is given to some, while to some it is not given. But why it is not given to all ought not
to disturb the believer, who believes that from one all have gone into a condemnation, which
undoubtedly is most righteous; so that even if none were delivered therefrom, there would
be no just cause for finding fault with God. Whence it is plain that it is a great grace for
many to be delivered, and to acknowledge in those that are not delivered what would be
due to themselves; so that he that glorieth may glory not in his own merits, which he sees
to be equalled in those that are condemned, but in the Lord. But why He delivers one rather
than another,—“His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out.”3481 For
it is better in this case for us to hear or to say, “O man, who art thou that repliest against
God?”3482 than to dare to speak as if we could know what He has chosen to be kept secret.
Since, moreover, He could not will anything unrighteous.</p>

    <head>Chapter 17 <del>IX.</del>—His Argument in His Letter Against Porphyry, as to Why the
Gospel Came So Late into the World.</head>
<p>But that which you remember my saying in a certain small treatise of mine against
Porphyry, under the title of The Time of the Christian Religion, I so said for the sake of escaping
this more careful and elaborate argument about grace; although its meaning, which
could be unfolded elsewhere or by others, was not wholly omitted, although I had been
unwilling in that place to explain it. For, among other matters, I spoke thus in answer to
the question proposed, why it was after so long a time that Christ came: “Accordingly, I say,
since they do not object to Christ that all do not follow His teaching (for even they themselves
feel that this could not be objected at all with any justice, either to the wisdom of the philosophers
or even to the deity of their own gods), what will they reply, if—leaving out of the
question that depth of God’s wisdom and knowledge where perchance some other divine
plan is far more secretly hidden, without prejudging also other causes, which cannot be
traced out by the wise—we say to them only this, for the sake of brevity in the arguing of
this question, that Christ willed to appear to men, and that His doctrine should be preached
among them, at that time when He knew, and at that place where He knew, that there were
some who would believe on Him. For at those times, and in those places, at which His gospel
was not preached, He foreknew that all would be in His preaching such as, not indeed all,
but many were in His bodily presence, who would not believe on Him, even when the dead
were raised by Him; such as we see many now, who, although the declarations of the
prophets concerning Him are fulfilled by such manifestations, are still unwilling to believe,
and prefer to resist by human astuteness, rather than yield to divine authority so clear and
perspicuous, and so lofty, and sublimely made known, so long as the human understanding
is small and weak in its approach to divine truth. What wonder is it, then, if Christ knew
the world in former ages to be so full of unbelievers, that He should reasonably refuse to
appear, or to be preached to them, who, as He foreknew, would believe neither His words
nor His miracles? For it is not incredible that all at that time were such as from His coming
even to the present time we marvel that so many have been and are. And yet from the beginning
of the human race, sometimes more hiddenly, sometimes more evidently, even as to
Divine Providence the times seemed to be fitting, there has neither been a failure of prophecy,
nor were there wanting those who believed on Him; as well from Adam to Moses, as in the
people of Israel itself which by a certain special mystery was a prophetic people; and in
other nations before He had come in the flesh. For as some are mentioned in the sacred
Hebrew books, as early as the time of Abraham,—neither of his fleshly race nor of the people
of Israel nor of the foreign society among the people of Israel,—who were, nevertheless,
sharers in their sacrament, why may we not believe that there were others elsewhere among
other people, here and there, although we do not read any mention of them in the same
authorities? Thus the salvation of this religion, by which only true one true salvation is truly

<pb n="1375"/>
promised, never failed him who was worthy of it; and whoever it failed was not worthy of
it. And from the very beginning of the propagation of man, even to the end, the gospel is
preached, to some for a reward, to some for judgment; and thus also those to whom the
faith was not announced at all were foreknown as those who would not believe; and those
to whom it was announced, although they were not such as would believe, are set forth as
an example for the former; while those to whom it is announced who should believe, are
prepared for the kingdom of heaven, and the company of the holy angels.”3483</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—The Preceding Argument Applied to the Present Time.</head>
<p>Do you not see that my desire was, without any prejudgment of the hidden counsel of
God, and of other reasons, to say what might seem sufficient about Christ’s foreknowledge,
to convince the unbelief of the pagans who had brought forward this question? For what is
more true than that Christ foreknew who should believe on Him, and at what times and
places they should believe? But whether by the preaching of Christ to themselves by themselves
they were to have faith, or whether they would receive it by God’s gift,—that is,
whether God only foreknew them, or also predestinated them, I did not at that time think
it necessary to inquire or to discuss. Therefore what I said, “that Christ willed to appear to
men at that time, and that His doctrine should be preached among them when He knew,
and where He knew, that there were those who would believe on Him,” may also thus be
said, “That Christ willed to appear to men at that time, and that His gospel should be preached
among those, whom He knew, and where He knew, that there were those who had been
elected in Himself before the foundation of the world.” But since, if it were so said, it would
make the reader desirous of asking about those things which now by the warning of Pelagian
errors must of necessity be discussed with greater copiousness and care, it seemed to me
that what at that time was sufficient should be briefly said, leaving to one side, as I said, the
depth of the wisdom and knowledge of God, and without prejudging other reasons, concerning
which I thought that we might more fittingly argue, not then, but at some other time.</p>

<head>Chapter 19 <del>X</del>—In What Respects Predestination and Grace Differ.</head>
<p>Moreover, that which I said, “That the salvation of this religion has never been lacking
to him who was worthy of it, and that he to whom it was lacking was not worthy,”—if it be
discussed and it be asked whence any man can be worthy, there are not wanting those who
say—by human will. But we say, by divine grace or predestination. Further, between grace
and predestination there is only this difference, that predestination is the preparation for
grace, while grace is the donation itself. When, therefore the apostle says, “Not of works,
lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good
works,”3484 it is grace; but what follows—“which God hath prepared that we should walk
in them”—is predestination, which cannot exist without foreknowledge, although foreknowledge
may exist without predestination; because God foreknew by predestination those
things which He was about to do, whence it was said, “He made those things that shall
be.”3485 Moreover, He is able to foreknow even those things which He does not Himself
do,—as all sins whatever. Because, although there are some which are in such wise sins as
that they are also the penalties of sins, whence it is said, “God gave them over to a reprobate
mind, to do those things which are not convenient,”3486 it is not in such a case the sin that
is God’s, but the judgment. Therefore God’s predestination of good is, as I have said, the
preparation of grace; which grace is the effect of that predestination. Therefore when God
promised to Abraham in his seed the faith of the nations, saying, “I have established thee a
father of many nations,”3487 whence the apostle says, “Therefore it is of faith, that the
promise, according to grace, might be established to all the seed,”3488 He promised not from
the power of our will but from His own predestination. For He promised what He Himself
would do, not what men would do. Because, although men do those good things which
pertain to God’s worship, He Himself makes them to do what He has commanded; it is not
they that cause Him to do what He has promised. Otherwise the fulfilment of God’s promises
would not be in the power of God, but in that of men; and thus what was promised by God
to Abraham would be given to Abraham by men themselves. Abraham, however, did not
believe thus, but “he believed, giving glory to God, that what He promised He is able also
to do.”3489 He does not say, “to foretell”—he does not say, “to foreknow;” for He can foretell
and foreknow the doings of strangers also; but he says, “He is able also to do;” and thus he
is speaking not of the doings of others, but of His own.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Did God Promise the Good Works of the Nations and Not Their Faith,
to Abraham?</head>
<p>Did God, perchance, promise to Abraham in his seed the good works of the nations, so
as to promise that which He Himself does, but did not promise the faith of the Gentiles,
which men do for themselves; but so as to promise what He Himself does, did He foreknow
that men would effect that faith? The apostle, indeed, does not speak thus, because God
promised children to Abraham, who should follow the footsteps of his faith, as he very
plainly says. But if He promised the works, and not the faith of the Gentiles certainly since
they are not good works unless they are of faith (for “the righteous lives of faith,”3490 and,
“Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,”3491 and, “Without faith it is impossible to please”3492),
it is nevertheless in man’s power that God should fulfil what He has promised. For unless
man should do what without the gift of God pertains to man, he will not cause God to
give,—that is, unless man have faith of himself. God does not fulfil what He has promised,
that works of righteousness should be given by God. And thus that God should be able to
fulfil His promises is not in God’s power, but man’s. And if truth and piety do not forbid
our believing this, let us believe with Abraham, that what He has promised He is able also
to perform. But He promised children to Abraham; and this men cannot be unless they
have faith, therefore He gives faith also.</p>

myself is to me uncertain? What then? Is thine own will concerning thyself certain to thee?
and dost thou not fear,—“Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall”?3494 Since,
then, both are uncertain, why does not man commit his faith, hope, and love to the stronger
will rather than to the weaker?</p>

<p>“But,” say they, “when it is said, ‘If thou believest, thou shalt be saved,’ one of these
things is required; the other is offered. What is required is in man’s power; what is offered
is in God’s.”3495 Why are not both in God’s, as well what He commands as what He offers?
For He is asked to give what He commands. Believers ask that their faith may be increased;
they ask on behalf of those who do not believe, that faith may be given to them; therefore
both in its increase and in its beginnings, faith is the gift of God. But it is said thus: “If thou
believest, thou shalt be saved,” in the same way that it is said, “If by the Spirit ye shall mortify
the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.”3496 For in this case also, of these two things one is
required, the other is offered. It is said, “If by the Spirit ye shall mortify the deeds of the
flesh, ye shall live.” Therefore, that we mortify the deeds of the flesh is required, but that we
may live is offered. Is it, then, fitting for us to say, that to mortify the deeds of the flesh is
not a gift of God, and not to confess it to be a gift of God, because we hear it required of us,
with the offer of life as a reward if we shall do it? Away with this being approved by the
partakers and champions of grace! This is the condemnable error of the Pelagians, whose
mouths the apostle immediately stopped when he added, “For as many as are led by the
Spirit of God, they are the sons of God;”3497 lest we should believe that we mortify the deeds
of the flesh, not by God’s Spirit, but by our own. And of this Spirit of God, moreover, he
was speaking in that place where he says, “But all these worketh that one and the self-same
Spirit, dividing unto every man what is his own, as He will;”3498 and among all these things,
as you know, he also named faith. As, therefore, although it is the gift of God to mortify the
deeds of the flesh, yet it is required of us, and life is set before us as a reward; so also faith
is the gift of God, although when it is said, “If thou believest, thou shalt be saved,” faith is
required of us, and salvation is proposed to us as a reward. For these things are both commanded
us, and are shown to be God’s gifts, in order that we may understand both that we
do them, and that God makes us to do them, as He most plainly says by the prophet Ezekiel.
For what is plainer than when He says, “I will cause you to do”?3499 Give heed to that passage
of Scripture, and you will see that God promises that He will make them to do those things
which He commands to be done. He truly is not silent as to the merits but as to the evil
deeds, of those to whom He shows that He is returning good for evil, by the very fact that
He causeth them thenceforth to have good works, in causing them to do the divine commands.</p>

manifestly asserted by the witness of the divine declarations, yet, among those who think
that they are withheld from all zeal for piety unless they can attribute to themselves something,

of a difficulty in respect of the condition of grown-up people, who are already exercising

God and man Himself, the man Christ Jesus, there is wanting all assertion of human merits
that precede the grace of God, because the former are not distinguished from others by any

<head>Chapter 24.—That No One is Judged According to What He Would Have Done If
He Had Lived Longer.</head>
<p>For who can hear that infants, baptized in the condition of mere infancy, are said to
depart from this life by reason of their future merits, and that others not baptized are said
to die in the same age because their future merits are foreknown,—but as evil; so that God
rewards or condemns in them not their good or evil life, but no life at all?3500 The apostle,
indeed, fixed a limit which man’s incautious suspicion, to speak gently, ought not to transgress,
for he says, “We shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may
receive according to the things which he has done by means of the body, whether it be good
or evil.”3501 “Has done,” he said; and he did not add, “or would have done.” But I know not
whence this thought should have entered the minds of such men, that infants’ future merits
(which shall not be) should be punished or honoured. But why is it said that a man is to be
judged according to those things which he has done by means of the body, when many
things are done by the mind alone, and not by the body, nor by any member of the body;
and for the most part things of such importance, that a most righteous punishment would
be due to such thought, such as,—to say nothing of others,—that “The fool hath said in his
heart there is no God”?3502 What, then, is the meaning of, “According to those things that
he hath done by means of the body,” except according to those things which he has done
during that time in which he was in the body, so that we may understand “by means of the
body” as meaning “throughout the season of bodily life”? But after the body, no one will be
in the body except at the last resurrection,—not for the purpose of establishing any claims
of merit, but for the sake of receiving recompenses for good merits, and enduring punishments
for evil merits. But in this intermediate period between the putting off and the taking
again of the body, the souls are either tormented or they are in repose, according to those
things which they have done during the period of the bodily life. And to this period of the
bodily life moreover pertains, what the Pelagians deny, but Christ’s Church confesses, original
sin; and according to whether this is by God’s grace loosed, or by God’s judgment not
loosed, when infants die, they pass, on the one hand, by the merit of regeneration from evil
to good, or on the other, by the merit of their origin from evil to evil. The catholic faith acknowledges
this, and even some heretics, without any contradiction, agree to this. But in
the height of wonder and astonishment I am unable to discover whence men, whose intelligence
your letters show to be by no means contemptible, could entertain the opinion that
any one should be judged not according to the merits that he had as long as he was in the
body, but according to the merits which he would have had if he had lived longer in the

lieve you. But I hope that God will interpose, so that when they are admonished they may
at once perceive, that if those sins which, as is said, would have been, can rightly be punished
by God’s judgment in those who are not baptized, they may alo be rightly remitted by God’s
grace in those who are baptized. For whoever says that future sins can only be punished by
God’s judgment, but cannot be pardoned by God’s mercy, ought to consider how great a
wrong he is doing to God and His grace; as if future sin could be foreknown, and could not
be foregone.3503 And if this is absurd, it is the greater reason that help should be afforded
to those who would be sinners if they lived longer, when they die in early life, by means of
that laver wherein sins are washed away.</p>

<head>Chapter 25 <del>XIII.</del>—Possibly the Baptized Infants Would Have Repented If They
Had Lived, and the Unbaptized Not.</head>
<p>But if, perchance, they say that sins are re-remitted to penitents, and that those who die
in infancy are not baptized because they are foreknown as not such as would repent if they
should live, while God has foreknown that those who are baptized and die in infancy would
have repented if they had lived, let them observe and see that if it be so it is not in this case
original sins which are punished in infants that die without baptism, but what would have
been the sins of each one had he lived; and also in baptized infants, that it is not original
sins that are washed away, but their own future sins if they should live, since they could not
sin except in more mature age; but that some were foreseen as such as would repent, and
others as such as would not repent, therefore some were baptized, and others departed from
this life without baptism. If the Pelagians should dare to say this, by their denial of original
sin they would thus be relieved of the necessity of seeking, on behalf of infants outside of
the kingdom of God, for some place of I know not what happiness of their own; especially
since they are convinced that they cannot have eternal life because they have not eaten the
flesh nor drank the blood of Christ; and because in them who have no sin at all, baptism,
which is given for the remission of sins, is falsified. For they would go on to say that there
is no original sin, but that those who as infants are released are either baptized or not baptized
according to their future merits if they should live, and that according to their future merits
they either receive or do not receive the body and blood of Christ, without which they absolutely
cannot have life; and are baptized for the true remission of sins although they derived
no sins from Adam, because the sins are remitted unto them concerning which God foreknew
that they would repent. Thus with the greatest ease they would plead and would win their
cause, in which they deny that there is any original sin, and contend that the grace of God
is only given according to our merits. But that the future merits of men, which merits will
never come into existence are beyond all doubt no merits at all, it is certainly most easy to
see: for this reason even the Pelagians were not able to say this; and much rather these ought
not to say it. For it cannot be said with what pain I find that they who with us on catholic
authority condemn the error of those heretics, have not seen this, which the Pelagians
themselves have seen to be most false and absurd.</p>

<head>Chapter 26 <del>XIV</del>—Reference to Cyprian’s Treatise “On the Mortality.”</head>
<p>Cyprian wrote a work On the Mortality,3504 known with approval to many and almost
all who love ecclesiastical literature, wherein he says that death is not only not disadvantageous
to believers, but that it is even found to be advantageous, because it withdraws men
from the risks of sinning, and establishes them in a security of not sinning. But wherein is
the advantage of this, if even future sins which have not been committed are punished? Yet
he argues most copiously and well that the risks of sinning are not wanting in this life, and
that they do not continue after this life is done; where also he adduces that testimony from
the book of Wisdom: “He was taken away, lest wickedness should alter his understanding.”
3505 And this was also adduced by me, though you said that those brethren of yours
had rejected it on the ground of its not having been brought forward from a canonical book;
as if, even setting aside the attestation of this book, the thing itself were not clear which I
wished to be taught therefrom. For what Christian would dare to deny that the righteous
man, if he should be prematurely laid hold of by death, will be in repose? Let who will, say
this, and what man of sound faith will think that he can withstand it? Moreover, if he should
say that the righteous man, if he should depart from his righteousness in which he has long
lived, and should die in that impiety after having lived in it, I say not a year, but one day,
will go hence into the punishment due to the wicked, his righteousness having no power in
the future to avail him,—will any believer contradict this evident truth? Further, if we are
asked whether, if he had died then at the time that he was righteous, he would have incurred
punishment or repose, shall we hesitate to answer, repose? This is the whole reason why it
is said,—whoever says it,—“He was taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding.”
For it was said in reference to the risks of this life, not with reference to the foreknowledge
of God, who foreknew that which was to be, not that which was not to be—that is,
that He would bestow on him an untimely death in order that he might be withdrawn from
the uncertainty of temptations; not that he would sin, since he was not to remain in
temptation. Because, concerning this life, we read in the book of Job, “Is not the life of man
upon earth a temptation?”3506 But why it should be granted to some to be taken away from
the perils of this life while they are righteous, while others who are righteous until they fall
from righteousness are kept in the same risks in a more lengthened life,—who has known
the mind of the Lord? And yet it is permitted to be understood from this, that even those
righteous people who maintain good and pious characters, even to the maturity of old age
and to the last day of this life, must not glory in their own merits, but in the Lord, since He
who took away the righteous man from the shortness of life, lest wickedness should alter

<head>Chapter 27.—The Book of Wisdom Obtains in the Church the Authority of Canonical
Scripture.</head>
<p>And since these things are so, the judgment of the book of Wisdom ought not to be repudiated,
since for so long a course of years that book has deserved to be read in the Church
of Christ from the station of the readers of the Church of Christ, and to be heard by all
Christians, from bishops downwards, even to the lowest lay believers, penitents, and catechumens,
with the veneration paid to divine authority. For assuredly, if, from those who have
been before me in commenting on the divine Scriptures, I should bring forward a defence
of this judgment, which we are now called upon to defend more carefully and copiously
than usual against the new error of the Pelagians,—that is, that God’s grace is not given according
to our merits, and that it is given freely to whom it is given, because it is neither of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy; but that by
righteous judgment it is not given to whom it is not given, because there is no unrighteousness
with God;—if, therefore, I should put forth a defence of this opinion from catholic commentators
on the divine oracles who have preceded us, assuredly these brethren for whose sake
I am now discoursing would acquiesce, for this you have intimated in your letters. What
need is there, then, for us to look into the writings of those who, before this heresy sprang
up, had no necessity to be conversant in a question so difficult of solution as this, which
beyond a doubt they would have done if they had been compelled to answer such things?
Whence it arose that they touched upon what they thought of God’s grace briefly in some
passages of their writings, and cursorily; but on those matters which they argued against
the enemies of the Church, and in exhortations to every virtue by which to serve the living
and true God for the purpose of attaining eternal life and true happiness, they dwelt at
length. But the grace of God, what it could do, shows itself artlessly by its frequent mention
in prayers; for what God commands to be done would not be asked for from God, unless it
could be given by Him that it should be done.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Cyprian’s Treatise “On the Mortality.”</head>
<p>But if any wish to be instructed in the opinions of those who have handled the subject,
it behoves them to prefer to all commentators the book of Wisdom, where it is read, “He
was taken away, that wickedness should not alter his understanding;” because illustrious
commentators, even in the times nearest to the apostles, preferred it to themselves, seeing
that when they made use of it for a testimony they believed that they were making use of
nothing but a divine testimony; and certainly it appears that the most blessed Cyprian, in
order to commend the advantage of an earlier death, contended that those who end this
life, wherein sin is possible, are taken away from the risks of sins. In the same treatise, among
other things, he says, “Why, when you are about to be with Christ, and are secure of the
divine promise, do you not embrace being called to Christ, and rejoice that you are free
from the devil?”3507 And in another place he says, “Boys escape the peril of their unstable
age.”3508 And again, in another place, he says, “Why do we not hasten and run, that we may
see our country, that we may hail our relatives? A great number of those who are dear to us
are expecting us there,—a dense and abundant crowd of parents, brethren, sons, are longing
for us; already secure of their own safety, but still anxious about our salvation.”3509 By these
and such like sentiments, that teacher sufficiently and plainly testifies, in the clearest light
of the catholic faith, that perils of sin and trials are to be feared even until the putting off of
this body, but that afterwards no one shall suffer any such things. And even if he did not
testify thus, when could any manner of Christian be in doubt on this matter? How, then,
should it not have been of advantage to a man who has lapsed, and who finishes his life
wretchedly in that same state of lapse, and passes into the punishment due to such as
he,—how, I say, should it not have been of the greatest and highest advantage to such an
one to be snatched by death from this sphere of temptations before his fall?</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—God’s Dealing Does Not Depend Upon Any Contingent Merits of
Men.</head>
<p>And thus, unless we indulge in reckless disputation, the entire question is concluded
concerning him who is taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding. And the
book of Wisdom, which for such a series of years has deserved to be read in Christ’s Church,
and in which this is read, ought not to suffer injustice because it withstands those who are
mistaken on behalf of men’s merit, so as to come in opposition to the most manifest grace
of God: and this grace chiefly appears in infants, and while some of these baptized, and some
not baptized, come to the end of this life, they sufficiently point to God’s mercy and His
judgment,—His mercy, indeed, gratuitous, His judgment, of debt. For if men should be
judged according to the merits of their life, which merits they have been prevented by death
from actually having, but would have had if they had lived, it would be of no advantage to
him who is taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding; it would be of no
advantage to those who die in a state of lapse if they should die before. And this no Christian
will venture to say. Wherefore our brethren, who with us on behalf of the catholic faith assail
the pest of the Pelagian error, ought not to such an extent to favour the Pelagian opinion,
wherein they conceive that God’s grace is given according to our merits, as to endeavour
(which they cannot dare) to invalidate a true sentiment, plainly and from ancient times
Christian,—“He was taken away, lest wickedness should alter his understanding;” and to
build up that which we should think, I do not say, no one would believe, but no one would
dream,—to wit, that any deceased person would be judged according to those things which
he would have done if he had lived for a more lengthened period. Surely thus what we say
manifests itself clearly to be incontestable,—that the grace of God is not given according to
our merits; so that ingenious men who contradict this truth are constrained to say things
which must be rejected from the ears and from the thoughts of all men.</p>

<head>Chapter 30 <del>XV.</del>—The Most Illustrious Instance of Predestination is Christ Jesus.</head>
<p>Moreover, the most illustrious Light of predestination and grace is the Saviour Himself,—
the Mediator Himself between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. And, pray, by
what preceding merits of its own, whether of works or of faith, did the human nature which
is in Him procure for itself that it should be this? Let this have an answer, I beg. That man,
whence did He deserve this—to be assumed by the Word co-eternal with the Father into
unity of person, and be the only-begotten Son of God? Was it because any kind of goodness
in Him preceded? What did He do before? What did He believe? What did He ask, that He
should attain to this unspeakable excellence? Was it not by the act and the assumption of
the Word that that man, from the time He began to be, began to be the only Son of God?
Did not that woman, full of grace, conceive the only Son of God? Was He not born the only
Son of God, of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary,—not of the lust of the flesh, but by
God’s peculiar gift? Was it to be feared that as age matured this man, He would sin of free
will? Or was the will in Him not free on that account? and was it not so much the more free
in proportion to the greater impossibility of His becoming the servant of sin? Certainly, in
Him human nature—that is to say, our nature—specially received all those specially admirable
gifts, and any others that may most truly be said to be peculiar to Him, by virtue of no preceding
merits of its own. Let a man here answer to God if he dare, and say, Why was it not
I also? And if he should hear, “O man, who art thou that repliest against God?”3510 let him
not at this point restrain himself, but increase his impudence and say, “How is it that I hear,
Who art thou, O man? since I am what I hear,—that is, a man, and He of whom I speak is
but the same? Why should not I also be what He is? For it is by grace that He is such and
so great; why is grace different when nature is common? Assuredly, there is no respect of
persons with God.” I say, not what Christian man, but what madman will say this?</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Christ Predestinated to Be the Son of God.</head>
<p>Therefore in Him who is our Head let there appear to be the very fountain of grace,
whence, according to the measure of every man, He diffuses Himself through all His members.
It is by that grace that every man from the beginning of his faith becomes a Christian,
by which grace that one man from His beginning became Christ. Of the same Spirit also
the former is born again of which the latter was born. By the same Spirit is effected in us
the remission of sins, by which Spirit it was effected that He should have no sin. God certainly
foreknew that He would do these things. This, therefore, is that same predestination of the
saints which most especially shone forth in the Saint of saints; and who is there of those
who rightly understand the declarations of the truth that can deny this predestination? For
we have learned that the Lord of glory Himself was predestinated in so far as the man was
made the Son of God. The teacher of the Gentiles exclaims, in the beginning of his epistles,
“Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God
(which He had promised afore by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures) concerning His Son,
which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was predestinated the Son
of God in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification by the resurrection of the dead.”3511
Therefore Jesus was predestinated, so that He who was to be the Son of David according to
the flesh should yet be in power the Son of God, according to the Spirit of sanctification,
because He was born of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary. This is that ineffably accomplished
sole taking up of man by God the Word, so that He might truly and properly be
called at the same time the Son of God and the Son of man,—Son of man on account of the
man taken up, and the Son of God on account of the God only-begotten who took Him up,
so that a Trinity and not a Quaternity might be believed in. Such a transporting of human
nature was predestinated, so great, so lofty, and so sublime that there was no exalting it
more highly,—just as on our behalf that divinity had no possibility of more humbly putting
itself off, than by the assumption of man’s nature with the weakness of the flesh, even to the
death of the cross. As, therefore, that one man was predestinated to be our Head, so we being
many are predestinated to be His members. Here let human merits which have perished
through Adam keep silence, and let that grace of God reign which reigns through Jesus
Christ our Lord, the only Son of God, the one Lord. Let whoever can find in our Head the
merits which preceded that peculiar generation, seek in us His members for those merits
which preceded our manifold regeneration. For that generation was not recompensed to
Christ, but given; that He should be born, namely, of the Spirit and the Virgin, separate
from all entanglement of sin. Thus also our being born again of water and the Spirit is not
recompensed to us for any merit, but freely given; and if faith has brought us to the laver of
regeneration, we ought not therefore to suppose that we have first given anything, so that
<note type="footnote">3511 Rom. i. 1 ff.</note>

<pb n="1392"/>
the regeneration of salvation should be recompensed to us again; because He made us to
believe in Christ, who made for us a Christ on whom we believe. He makes in men the beginning
and the completion of the faith in Jesus who made the man Jesus the beginner and
finisher of faith;3512 for thus, as you know, He is called in the epistle which is addressed to
the Hebrews.</p>

<p>God indeed calls many predestinated children of His, to make them members of His

come to the marriage, since with that calling were called also the Jews, to whom Christ
crucified is an offence, and the Gentiles, to whom Christ crucified is foolishness; but with
that calling He calls the predestinated which the apostle distinguished when he said that he
preached Christ, the wisdom of God and the power of God, to them that were called, Jews
as well as Greeks. For thus he says “But unto them which are called,”3513 in order to show
that there were some who were not called; knowing that there is a certain sure calling of
those who are called according to God’s purpose, whom He has foreknown and predestinated
before to be conformed to the image of His Son. And it was this calling he meant when he
said, “Not of works, but of Him that calleth; it was said unto her, That the elder shall serve
the younger.”3514 Did he say, “Not of works, but of him that believeth”? Rather, he actually
took this away from man, that he might give the whole to God. Therefore he said, “But of
Him that calleth,”—not with any sort of calling whatever, but with that calling wherewith
a man is made a believer.</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—It is in the Power of Evil Men to Sin; But to Do This or That by Means
of that Wickedness is in God’s Power Alone.</head>
<p>Moreover, it was this that he had in view when he said, “The gifts and calling of God
are without repentance.”3515 And in that saying also consider for a little what was its purport.
For when he had said, “For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery,
that ye may not be wise in yourselves, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the
fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel should be saved; as it is written, There
shall come out of Sion one who shall deliver, and turn away impiety from Jacob: and this is
the covenant to them from me, when I shall take away their sins;”3516 he immediately added,
what is to be very carefully understood, “As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies
for your sakes: but as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers’ sakes.”3517
What is the meaning of, “as concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake,”
but that their enmity wherewith they put Christ to death was, without doubt, as we see, an
advantage to the gospel? And he shows that this came about by God’s ordering, who knew
how to make a good use even of evil things; not that the vessels of wrath might be of advantage
to Him, but that by His own good use of them they might be of advantage to the vessels
of mercy. For what could be said more plainly than what is actually said, “As concerning
the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes”? It is, therefore, in the power of the
wicked to sin; but that in sinning they should do this or that by that wickedness is not in
their power, but in God’s, who divides the darkness and regulates it; so that hence even what
they do contrary to God’s will is not fulfilled except it be God’s will. We read in the Acts of
the Apostles that when the apostles had been sent away by the Jews, and had come to their
own friends, and shown them what great things the priests and elders said to them, they all
with one consent lifted up their voices to the Lord and said, “Lord, thou art God, which hast
made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who, by the mouth of
our father David, thy holy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the peoples
imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes were gathered together
against the Lord, and against His Christ. For in truth, there have assembled together in this
city against Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, Herod and Pilate, and the
people of Israel, to do whatever Thy hand and counsel predestinated to be done.”3518 See
what is said: “As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes.” Because
God’s hand and counsel predestinated such things to be done by the hostile Jews as were
necessary for the gospel, for our sakes. But what is it that follows? “But as concerning the

<pb n="1395"/>
election, they are beloved for their fathers’ sakes.” For are those enemies who perished in
their enmity and those of the same people who still perish in their opposition to Christ,—are
those chosen and beloved? Away with the thought! Who is so utterly foolish as to say this?
But both expressions, although contrary to one another—that is, “enemies” and “beloved”—
are appropriate, though not to the same men, yet to the same Jewish people, and
to the same carnal seed of lsrael, of whom some belonged to the falling away, and some to
the blessing of Israel himself. For the apostle previously explained this meaning more clearly
when he said, “That which lsrael wrought for, he hath not obtained; but the election hath
obtained it, and the rest were blinded?”3519 Yet in both cases it was the very same Israel.
Where, therefore, we hear, “Israel hath not obtained,” or, “The rest were blinded,” there are
to be understood the enemies for our sakes; but where we hear, “that the election hath obtained
it,” there are to be understood the beloved for their father’s sakes, to which fathers
those things were assuredly promised; because “the promises were made to Abraham and
his seed,”3520 whence also in that olive-tree is grafted the wild olive-tree of the Gentiles.
Now subsequently we certainly ought to fall in with the election, of which he says that it is
according to grace, not according to debt, because “there was made a remnant by the election
of grace”3521 This election obtained it, the rest being blinded. As concerning this election,
the Israelites were beloved for the sake of their fathers. For they were not called with that
calling of which it is said, “Many are called,” but with that whereby the chosen are called.
Whence also after he had said, “But as concerning the election, they are beloved for the
fathers’ sakes,” he went on to add those words whence this discussion arose: “For the gifts
and calling of God are without repentance,”—that is, they are firmly established without
change. Those who belong to this calling are all teachable by God; nor can any of them say,
“I believed in order to being thus called,” because the mercy of God anticipated him, because
he was so called in order that he might believe. For all who are teachable of God come to
the Son because they have heard and learned from the Father through the Son, who most
clearly says, “Every one who has heard of the Father, and has learned, cometh unto me.”3522
But of such as these none perishes, because “of all that the Father hath given Him, He will
lose none.”3523 Whoever, therefore, is of these does not perish at all; nor was any who perishes
ever of these. For which reason it is said, “They went out from among us, but they were not
of us; for if they had been of us, they would certainly have continued with us.”3524</p>

elected because they have believed, but who are elected that they may believe. For the Lord
Himself also sufficiently explains this calling when He says, “Ye have not chosen me, but I
have chosen you.”3525 For if they had been elected because they had believed, they themselves
would certainly have first chosen Him by believing in Him, so that they should deserve to
be elected. But He takes away this supposition altogether when He says, “Ye have not chosen
me, but I have chosen you.” And yet they themselves, beyond a doubt, chose Him when
they believed on Him. Whence it is not for any other reason that He says, “Ye have not
chosen me, but I have chosen you,” than because they did not choose Him that He should
choose them, but He chose them that they might choose Him; because His mercy preceded
them according to grace, not according to debt. Therefore He chose them out of the world
while He was wearing flesh, but as those who were already chosen in Himself before the
foundation of the world. This is the changeless truth concerning predestination and grace.
For what is it that the apostle says, “As He hath chosen us in Himself before the foundation
of the world”? 3526 And assuredly, if this were said because God foreknew that they would
believe, not because He Himself would make them believers, the Son is speaking against
such a foreknowledge as that when He says, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you;” when God should rather have foreknown this very thing, that they themselves would
have chosen Him, so that they might deserve to be chosen by Him. Therefore they were
elected before the foundation of the world with that predestination in which God foreknew
what He Himself would do; but they were elected out of the world with that calling whereby
God fulfilled that which He predestinated. For whom He predestinated, them He also called,
with that calling, to wit, which is according to the purpose. Not others, therefore, but those
whom He predestinated, them He also called; nor others, but those whom He so called,
them He also justified; nor others, but those whom He predestinated, called, and justified,
them He also glorified; assuredly to that end which has no end. Therefore God elected believers;
but He chose them that they might be so, not because they were already so. The
Apostle James says: “Has not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of
the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him?”3527 By choosing them,
therefore; He makes them rich in faith, as He makes them heirs of the kingdom; because
He is rightly said to choose that in them, in order to make which in them He chose them. I
ask, who can hear the Lord saying, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,” and

can dare to say that men believe in order to be elected, when they are rather elected to believe;
lest against the judgment of truth they be found to have first chosen Christ to whom Christ
says, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you”?3528</p>

<p>Who can hear the apostle saying, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who hath blessed us in all spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ; as He has chosen
us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without spot in
His sight; in love predestinating us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself
according to the good pleasure of His will, wherein He hath shown us favour in His beloved
Son; in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins according to
the riches of His grace, which hath abounded to us in all wisdom and prudence; that He
might show to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He hath
purposed in Himself, in the dispensation of the fulness of times, to restore all things in
Christ, which are in heaven, and in the earth, in Him: in whom also we have obtained a
share, being predestinated according to the purpose; who worketh all things according to
the counsel of His will, that we should be to the praise of his glory;”3529—who, I say, can
hear these words with attention and intelligence, and can venture to have any doubt concerning
a truth so clear as this which we are defending? God chose Christ’s members in
Him before the foundation of the world; and how should He choose those who as yet did
not exist, except by predestinating them? Therefore He chose us by predestinating us. Would
he choose the unholy and the unclean? Now if the question be proposed, whether He would
choose such, or rather the holy and unstained, who can ask which of these he may answer,
and not give his opinion at once in favour of the holy and pure?</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—God Chose the Righteous; Not Those Whom He Foresaw as Being of
Themselves, But Those Whom He Predestinated for the Purpose of Making So.</head>
<p>“Therefore,” says the Pelagian, “He foreknew who would be holy and immaculate by
the choice of free will, and on that account elected them before the foundation of the world
in that same foreknowledge of His in which He foreknew that they would be such. Therefore
He elected them,” says he, “before they existed, predestinating them to be children whom
He foreknew to be holy and immaculate. Certainly He did not make them so; nor did He
foresee that He would make them so, but that they would be so.” Let us, then, look into the
words of the apostle and see whether He chose us before the foundation of the world because
we were going to be holy and immaculate, or in order that we might be so. “Blessed,” says
he, “be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us in all spiritual
blessing in the heavens in Christ; even as He hath chosen us in Himself before the foundation
of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted.” 3530 Not, then, because we were to be
so, but that we might be so. Assuredly it is certain,—assuredly it is manifest. Certainly we
were to be such for the reason that He has chosen us, predestinating us to be such by His
grace. Therefore “He blessed us with spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ Jesus, even
as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and immaculate
in His sight, in order that we might not in so great a benefit of grace glory concerning
the good pleasure of our will. “In which,” says he, “He hath shown us favour in His beloved
Son,”—in which, certainly, His own will, He hath shown us favour. Thus, it is said,
He hath shown us grace by grace, even as it is said, He has made us righteous by righteousness.
“In whom,” he says, “we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of His grace, which has abounded to us in all wisdom and prudence;
that he might show to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure.” In this
mystery of His will, He placed the riches of His grace, according to His good pleasure, not
according to ours, which could not possibly be good unless He Himself, according to His
own good pleasure, should aid it to become so. But when he had said, “According to His
good pleasure,” he added, “which He purposed in Him,” that is, in His beloved Son, “in the
dispensation of the fulness of times to restore all things in Christ, which are in heaven, and
which are in earth, in Him: in whom also we too have obtained a lot, being predestinated
according to His purpose who worketh all things according to the counsel of His will; that
we should be to the praise of His glory.”</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—We Were Elected and Predestinated, Not Because We Were Going to
Be Holy, But in Order that We Might Be So.</head>
<p>It would be too tedious to argue about the several points. But you see without doubt,
you see with what evidence of apostolic declaration this grace is defended, in opposition to
which human merits are set up, as if man should first give something for it to be recompensed
to him again. Therefore God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, predestinating
us to the adoption of children, not because we were going to be of ourselves holy
and immaculate, but He chose and predestinated us that we might be so. Moreover, He did
this according to the good pleasure of His will, so that nobody might glory concerning his
own will, but about God’s will towards himself. He did this according to the riches of His
grace, according to His good-will, which He purposed in His beloved Son; in whom we have
obtained a share, being predestinated according to the purpose, not ours, but His, who
worketh all things to such an extent as that He worketh in us to will also. Moreover, He
worketh according to the counsel of His will, that we may be to the praise of His glory.3531
For this reason it is that we cry that no one should glory in man, and, thus, not in himself;
but whoever glorieth let him glory in the Lord, that he may be for the praise of His glory.
Because He Himself worketh according to His purpose that we may be to the praise of His
glory, and, of course, holy and immaculate, for which purpose He called us, predestinating
us before the foundation of the world. Out of this, His purpose, is that special calling of the
elect for whom He co-worketh with all things for good, because they are called according
to His purpose, and “the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.”3532</p>

<head>Chapter 38 <del>XIX.</del>—What is the View of the Pelagians, and What of the Semi-Pelagians,
Concerning Predestination.</head>
<p>But these brethren of ours, about whom and on whose behalf we are now discoursing,
say, perhaps, that the Pelagians are refuted by this apostolical testimony in which it is said
that we are chosen in Christ and predestinated before the foundation of the world, in order
that we should be holy and immaculate in His sight in love. For they think that “having received
God’s commands we are of ourselves by the choice of our free will made holy and
immaculate in His sight in love; and since God foresaw that this would be the case,” they
say, “He therefore chose and predestinated us in Christ before the foundation of the world.”
Although the apostle says that it was not because He foreknew that we should be such, but
in order that we might be such by the same election of His grace, by which He showed us
favour in His beloved Son. When, therefore, He predestinated us, He foreknew His own
work by which He makes us holy and immaculate. Whence the Pelagian error is rightly refuted
by this testimony. “But we say,” say they, “that God did not foreknow anything as ours
except that faith by which we begin to believe, and that He chose and predestinated us before
the foundation of the world, in order that we might be holy and immaculate by His grace
and by His work.” But let them also hear in this testimony the words where he says, “We
have obtained a lot, being predestinated according to His purpose who worketh all things.”
3533 He, therefore, worketh the beginning of our belief who worketh all things; because faith
itself does not precede that calling of which it is said: “For the gifts and calling of God are
without repentance;”3534 and of which it is said: “Not of works, but of Him that calleth”3535
(although He might have said, “of Him that believeth”); and the election which the Lord
signified when He said: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.”3536 For He chose
us, not because we believed, but that we might believe, lest we should be said first to have
chosen Him, and so His word be false (which be it far from us to think possible), “Ye have
not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” Neither are we called because we believed, but that
we may believe; and by that calling which is without repentance it is effected and carried
through that we should believe. But all the many things which we have said concerning this
matter need not to be repeated.</p>

<head>Chapter 39—The Beginning of Faith is God’s Gift.</head>
<p>Finally, also, in what follows this testimony, the apostle gives thanks to God on behalf
of those who have believed;—not, certainly, because the gospel has been declared to them,
but because they have believed. For he says, “In whom also after ye had heard the word of
truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with
the Holy Spirit of promise, which is the pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of the
purchased possession unto the praise of His glory. Wherefore I also, after I had heard of
your faith in Christ Jesus and with reference to all the saints, cease not to give thanks for
you.”3537 Their faith was new and recent on the preaching of the gospel to them, which faith
when he hears of, the apostle gives thanks to God on their behalf. If he were to give thanks
to man for that which he might either think or know that man had not given, it would be
called a flattery or a mockery, rather than a giving of thanks. “Do not err, for God is not
mocked;”3538 for His gift is also the beginning of faith, unless the apostolic giving of thanks
be rightly judged to be either mistaken or fallacious. What then? Does that not appear as
the beginning of the faith of the Thessalonians, for which, nevertheless, the same apostle
gives thanks to God when he says, “For this cause also we thank God without ceasing, because
when ye had received from us the word of the hearing of God, ye received it not as the word
of men, but as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh in you and which
ye believed”?3539 What is that for which he here gives thanks to God? Assuredly it is a vain
and idle thing if He to whom he gives thanks did not Himself do the thing. But, since this
is not a vain and idle thing, certainly God, to whom he gave thanks concerning this work,
Himself did it; that when they had received the word of the hearing of God, they received
it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God. God, therefore, worketh in
the hearts of men with that calling according to His purpose, of which we have spoken a
great deal, that they should not hear the gospel in vain, but when they heard it, should be
converted and believe, receiving it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of
God.</p>

<head>Chapter 40 <del>XX.</del>—Apostolic Testimony to the Beginning of Faith Being God’s Gift.</head>
<p>Moreover, we are admonished that the beginning of men’s faith is God’s gift, since the
apostle signifies this when, in the Epistle to the Colossians, he says, “Continue in prayer,
and watch in the same in giving of thanks. Withal praying also for us that God would open
unto us the door of His word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which also I am in bonds,
that I may so make it manifest as I ought to speak.”3540 How is the door of His word opened,
except when the sense of the hearer is opened so that he may believe, and, having made a
beginning of faith, may admit those things which are declared and reasoned, for the purpose
of building up wholesome doctrine, lest, by a heart closed through unbelief, he reject and
repel those things which are spoken? Whence, also, he says to the Corinthians: “But I will
tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. For a great and evident door is opened unto me, and there
are many adversaries.”3541 What else can be understood here, save that, when the gospel
had been first of all preached there by him, many had believed, and there had appeared
many adversaries of the same faith, in accordance with that saying of the Lord, “No one
cometh unto me, unless it were given him of my Father;”3542 and, “To you it is given to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given”?3543 Therefore,
there is an open door in those to whom it is given, but there are many adversaries among
those to whom it is not given.</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—Further Apostolic Testimonies.</head>
<p>And again, the same apostle says to the same people, in his second Epistle: “When I had
come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door had been opened unto me in the Lord, I
had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus, my brother: but, making my farewell to
them, I went away into Macedonia.”3544 To whom did he bid farewell but to those who had
believed,—to wit, in whose hearts the door was opened for his preaching of the gospel? But
attend to what he adds, saying, “Now thanks be unto God, who always causes us to triumph
in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in every place: because
we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them who are saved, and in them who perish:
to some, indeed, we are the savour of death unto death, but to some the savour of life unto
life.”3545 See concerning what this most zealous soldier and invincible defender of grace
gives thanks. See concerning what he gives thanks,—that the apostles are a sweet savour of
Christ unto God, both in those who are saved by His grace, and in those who perish by His
judgment. But in order that those who little understand these things may be less enraged,
he himself gives a warning when he adds the words: “And who is sufficient for these
things?”3546 But let us return to the opening of the door by which the apostle signified the
beginning of faith in his hearers. For what is the meaning of, “Withal praying also for us
that God would open unto us a door of the word,”3547 unless it is a most manifest demonstration
that even the very beginning of faith is the gift of God? For it would not be sought
for from Him in prayer, unless it were believed to be given by Him. This gift of heavenly
grace had descended to that seller of purple3548 for whom, as Scripture says in the Acts of
the Apostles, “The Lord opened her heart, and she gave heed unto the things which were
said by Paul;” for she was so called that she might believe. Because God does what He will
in the hearts of men, either by assistance or by judgment; so that, even through their means,
may be fulfilled what His hand and counsel have predestinated to be done.</p>

<p>Therefore also it is in vain that objectors have alleged, that what we have proved by
Scripture testimony from the books of Kings and Chronicles is not pertinent to the subject
of which we are discoursing:3549 such, for instance, as that when God wills that to be done
which ought only to be done by the willing men, their hearts are inclined to will this,—inclined,
that is to say, by His power, who, in a marvellous and ineffable manner, worketh in
us also to will. What else is this than to say nothing, and yet to contradict? Unless perchance,
they have given some reason to you for the view that they have taken, which reason you
have preferred to say nothing about in your letters. But what that reason can be I do not
know. Whether, possibly, since we have shown that God has so acted on the hearts of men,
and has induced the wills of those whom He pleased to this point, that Saul or David should
be established as king,—do they not think that these instances are appropriate to this subject,
because to reign in this world temporally is not the same thing as to reign eternally with
God? And so do they suppose that God inclines the wills of those whom He pleases to the
attainment of earthly kingdoms, but does not incline them to the attainment of a heavenly
kingdom? But I think that it was in reference to the kingdom of heaven, and not to an earthly
kingdom, that it was said, “Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies;”3550 or, “The steps of a
man are ordered by the Lord, and He will will His way;”3551 or, “The will is prepared by the
Lord;”3552 or, “Let our Lord be with us as with our fathers; let Him not forsake us, nor turn
Himself away from us; let Him incline our hearts unto Him, that we may walk in all His
ways;”3553 or, “I will give them a heart to know me, and ears that hear;”3554 or, “I will give
them another heart, and a new spirit will I give them.”3555 Let them also hear this, “I will

<head>Chapter 43 <del>XXI.</del>—Conclusion.</head>
<p>I have said a great deal, and, perchance, I could long ago have persuaded you what I
wished, and am still speaking this to such intelligent minds as if they were obtuse, to whom
even what is too much is not enough. But let them pardon me, for a new question has
compelled me to this. Because, although in my former little treatises I had proved by sufficiently
appropriate proofs that faith also was the gift of God, there was found this ground
of contradiction, viz., that those testimonies were good for this purpose, to show that the
increase of faith was God’s gift, but that the beginning of faith, whereby a man first of all
believes in Christ, is of the man himself, and is not the gift of God,—but that God requires
this, so that when it has preceded, other gifts may follow, as it were on the ground of this
merit, and these are the gifts of God; and that none of them is given freely, although in them
God’s grace is declared, which is not grace except as being gratuitous. And you see how absurd
all this is. Wherefore I determined, as far as I could, to set forth that this very beginning also
is God’s gift. And if I have done this at a greater length than perhaps those on whose account
I did it might wish, I am prepared to be reproached for it by them, so long as they nevertheless
confess that, although at greater length than they wished, although with the disgust and
weariness of those that understand, I have done what I have done: that is, I have taught that
even the beginning of faith, as continence, patience, righteousness, piety, and the rest, concerning
which there is no dispute with them, is God’s gift. Let this, therefore, be the end of
this treatise, lest too great length in this one may give offence.</p>

<head>A TREATISE ON THE GIFT OF PERSEVERANCE,3560</head>
<p>BY AURELIUS AUGUSTIN, BISHOP OF HIPPO;
Being the Second Book,
Of the Treatise “On the Predestination of the Saints.”
addressed to prosper and hilary.</p>
<p>a.d. 428 or 429</p>
<p>In the first part of the book he proves that the perseverance by which a man perseveres in
Christ to the end is God’s gift; for that it is a mockery to ask of God that which is not believed
to be given by God. Moreover, that in the Lord’s prayer scarcely anything is asked
for but perseverance, according to the exposition of the martyr Cyprian, by which exposition
the enemies to this grace were convicted before they were born. He teaches that the grace
of perseverance is not given according to the merits of the receivers, but to some it is given
by God’s mercy; to others it is not given, by His righteous judgment. That it is inscrutable
why, of adults, one rather than another should be called; just as, moreover, of two infants
it is inscrutable why the one should be taken, the other left. But that it is still more inscrutable
why, of two pious persons, to one it should be given to persevere, to the other it should
not be given; but that this is most certain, that the former is of the predestinated, the latter
is not. He observes that the mystery of predestination is set forth in our Lord’s words
concerning the people of Tyre and Sidon, who would have repented if the same miracles
had been done among them which had been done in Chorazin. He shows that the case of
infants is of force to confirm the truth of predestination and grace in older people; and he
answers the passage of his third book on free will, unsoundly alleged on this point by his
adversaries. Subsequently, in the second part of this work, he rebuts what they say,—to
wit, that the definition of predestination is opposed to the usefulness of exhortation and
rebuke. He asserts, on the other hand, that it is advantageous to preach predestination,

so that man may not glory in himself, but in the Lord. As to the objections, however, which
they make against predestination, he shows that the same objections may be twisted in
no unlike manner either against God’s foreknowledge or against that grace which they all
agree to be necessary for other good things (with the exception of the beginning of faith
and the completion of perseverance). For that the predestination of the saints is nothing
else than God’s foreknowledge and preparation for His benefits, by which whoever are
delivered are most certainly delivered. But he bids that predestination should be preached
in a harmonious manner, and not in such a way as to seem to an unskilful multitude as
if it were disproved by its very preaching. Lastly, he commends to us Jesus Christ, as placed
before our eyes, as the most eminent instance of predestination.</p>

<head>Chapter 1 <del>I.</del>—Of the Nature of the Perseverance Here Discoursed of.</head>
<p>I Have now to consider the subject of perseverance with greater care; for in the former
book also I said some things on this subject when I was discussing the beginning of faith. I
assert, therefore, that the perseverance by which we persevere in Christ even to the end is
the gift of God; and I call that the end by which is finished that life wherein alone there is
peril of falling. Therefore it is uncertain whether any one has received this gift so long as he
is still alive. For if he fall before he dies, he is, of course, said not to have persevered; and
most truly is it said. How, then, should he be said to have received or to have had perseverance
who has not persevered? For if any one have continence, and fall away from that virtue and
become incontinent,—or, in like manner, if he have righteousness, if patience, if even faith,
and fall away, he is rightly said to have had these virtues and to have them no longer; for he
was continent, or he was righteous, or he was patient, or he was believing, as long as he was
so; but when he ceased to be so, he no longer is what he was. But how should he who has
not persevered have ever been persevering, since it is only by persevering that any one shows
himself persevering,—and this he has not done? But lest any one should object to this, and
say, If from the time at which any one became a believer he has lived—for the sake of argument—
ten years, and in the midst of them has fallen from the faith, has he not persevered
for five years? I am not contending about words. If it be thought that this also should be
called perseverance, as it were for so long as it lasts, assuredly he is not to be said to have
had in any degree that perseverance of which we are now discoursing, by which one perseveres
in Christ even to the end. And the believer of one year, or of a period as much
shorter as may be conceived of, if he has lived faithfully until he died, has rather had this
perseverance than the believer of many years’ standing, if a little time before his death he
has fallen away from the stedfastness of his faith.</p>

<head>Chapter 2 <del>II.</del>—Faith is the Beginning of a Christian Man. Martyrdom for Christ’s
Sake is His Best Ending.</head>
<p>This matter being settled, let us see whether this perseverance, of which it was said, “He
that persevereth unto the end, the same shall be saved,”3561 is a gift of God. And if it be not,
how is that saying of the apostle true: “Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only
to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake”?3562 Of these things, certainly, one has
respect to the beginning, the other to the end. Yet each is the gift of God, because both are
said to be given; as, also, I have already said above. For what is more truly the beginning for
a Christian than to believe in Christ? What end is better than to suffer for Christ? But so far
as pertains to believing in Christ, whatever kind of contradiction has been discovered, that
not the beginning but the increase of faith should be called God’s gift,—to this opinion, by
God’s gift, I have answered enough, and more than enough. But what reason can be given
why perseverance to the end should not be given in Christ to him to whom it is given to
suffer for Christ, or, to speak more distinctly, to whom it is given to die for Christ? For the
Apostle Peter, showing that this is the gift of God, says, “It is better, if the will of God be so,
to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.”3563 When he says, “If the will of God be so,”
he shows that this is divinely given, and yet not to all saints, to suffer for Christ’s sake. For
certainly those whom the will of God does not will to attain to the experience and the glory
of suffering, do not fail to attain to the kingdom of God if they persevere in Christ to the
end. But who can say that this perseverance is not given to those who die in Christ from
any weakness of body, or by any kind of accident, although a far more difficult perseverance
is given to those by whom even death itself is undergone for Christ’s sake? Because perseverance
is much more difficult when the persecutor is engaged in preventing a man’s perseverance;
and therefore he is sustained in his perseverance unto death. Hence it is more difficult
to have the former perseverance,—easier to have the latter; but to Him to whom nothing is
difficult it is easy to give both. For God has promised this, saying, “I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they may not depart from me.”3564 And what else is this than, “Such and so
great shall be my fear that I will put into their hearts that they will perseveringly cleave to
me”?</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—God is Besought for It, Because It is His Gift.</head>
<p>But why is that perseverance asked for from God if it is not given by God? Is that, too,
a mocking petition, when that is asked from Him which it is known that He does not give,
but, though He gives it not, is in man’s power; just as that giving of thanks is a mockery, if
thanks are given to God for that which He did not give nor do? But what I have said there,3565
I say also here again: “Be not deceived,” says the apostle, “God is not mocked.”3566 O man,
God is a witness not only of your words, but also of your thoughts. If you ask anything in
truth and faith of one who is so rich, believe that you receive from Him from whom you
ask, what you ask. Abstain from honouring Him with your lips and extolling yourself over
Him in your heart, by believing that you have from yourself what you are pretending to
beseech from Him. Is not this perseverance, perchance, asked for from Him? He who says
this is not to be rebuked by any arguments, but must be overwhelmed3567 with the prayers
of the saints. Is there any of these who does not ask for himself from God that he may persevere
in Him, when in that very prayer which is called the Lord’s—because the Lord taught
it—when it is prayed by the saints, scarcely anything else is understood to be prayed for but
perseverance?</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Three Leading Points of the Pelagian Doctrine.</head>
<p>Read with a little more attention its exposition in the treatise of the blessed martyr
Cyprian, which he wrote concerning this matter, the title of which is, On the Lord’s Prayer;
and see how many years ago, and what sort of an antidote was prepared against those poisons
which the Pelagians were one day to use. For there are three points, as you know, which the
catholic Church chiefly maintains against them. One of these is, that the grace of God is not
given according to our merits; because even every one of the merits of the righteous is God’s
gift, and is conferred by God’s grace. The second is, that no one lives in this corruptible
body, however righteous he may be, without sins of some kind. The third is, that man is
born obnoxious to the first man’s sin, and bound by the chain of condemnation, unless the
guilt which is contracted by generation be loosed by regeneration. Of these three points,
that which I have placed last is the only one that is not treated of in the above-named book
of the glorious martyr; but of the two others the discourse there is of such perspicuity, that
the above-named heretics, modern enemies of the grace of Christ, are found to have been
convicted long before they were born. Among these merits of the saints, then, which are no
merits unless they are the gifts of God, he says that perseverance also is God’s gift, in these
words: “We say, ‘Hallowed be Thy name;’ not that we ask for God that He may be hallowed
by our prayers, but that we beseech of Him that His name may be hallowed in us. But by
whom is God sanctified, since He Himself sanctifies? Well, because He says, Be ye holy because
I also am holy, we ask and entreat that we, who were sanctified in baptism, may persevere
in that which we have begun to be.”3568 And a little after, still arguing about that selfsame
matter, and teaching that we entreat perseverance from the Lord, which we could in
no wise rightly and truly do unless it were His gift, he says: “We pray that this sanctification
may abide in us; and because our Lord and Judge warns the man that was healed and
quickened by Him to sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto him, we make this supplication
in our constant prayers; we ask this, day and night, that the sanctification and
quickening which is received from the grace of God may be preserved by His protection.”3569
That teacher, therefore, understands that we are asking from Him for perseverance in
sanctification, that is, that we should persevere in sanctification, when we who are sanctified
say, “Hallowed be Thy name.” For what else is it to ask for what we have already received,
than that it be given to us also not to cease from its possession? As, therefore, the saint, when
he asks God that he may be holy, is certainly asking that he may continue to be holy, so
certainly the chaste person also, when he asks that he may be chaste, the continent that he
may be continent, the righteous that he may be righteous, the pious that he may be pious,
and the like,—which things, against the Pelagians, we maintain to be God’s gifts,—are asking,

that they have received. And if they receive this, assuredly they also receive perseverance
itself, the great gift of God, whereby His other gifts are preserved.</p>

<p>What, when we say, “Thy kingdom come,” do we ask else, but that that should also
come to us which we do not doubt will come to all saints? And therefore here also, what do
they who are already holy pray for, save that they may persevere in that holiness which has
been given them? For no otherwise will the kingdom of God come to them; which it is certain
will come not to others, but to those who persevere to the end.</p>

<head>Chapter 6 <del>III.</del>—The Third Petition. How Heaven and Earth are Understood in the
Lord’s Prayer.</head>
<p>The third petition is, “Thy will be done in heaven and in earth;” or, as it is read in many
codices, and is more frequently made use of by petitioners, “As in heaven, so also in earth,”
which many people understand, “As the holy angels, so also may we do thy will.” That
teacher and martyr will have heaven and earth, however, to be understood as spirit and
flesh, and says that we pray that we may do the will of God with the full concord of both.
He saw in these words also another meaning, congruous to the soundest faith, of which
meaning I have already spoken above,—to wit, that for unbelievers, who are as yet earth,
bearing in their first birth only the earthly man, believers are understood to pray, who, being
clothed with the heavenly man, are not unreasonably called by the name of heaven; where
he plainly shows that the beginning of faith also is God’s gift, since the holy Church prays
not only for believers, that faith may be increased or may continue in them, but, moreover,
for unbelievers, that they may begin to have what they have not had at all, and against which,
besides, they were indulging hostile feelings. Now, however, I am arguing not concerning
the beginning of faith, of which I have already spoken much in the former book, but of that
perseverance which must be had even to the end,—which assuredly even the saints, who do
the will of God, seek when they say in prayer, “Thy will be done.” For, since it is already
done in them, why do they still ask that it may be done, except that they may persevere in
that which they have begun to be? Nevertheless, it may here be said that the saints do not
ask that the will of God may be done in heaven, but that it may be done in earth as in heaven,—
that is to say, that earth may imitate heaven, that is, that man may imitate the angel,
or that an unbeliever may imitate a believer; and thus that the saints are asking that that
may be which is not yet, not that that which is may continue. For, by whatever holiness men
may be distinguished, they are not yet equal to the angels of God; not yet, therefore, is the
will of God done in them as it is in heaven. And if this be so, in that portion indeed in which
we ask that men from unbelievers may become believers, it is not perseverance, but beginning,
that seems to be asked for; but in that in which we ask that men may be made equal to the
angels of God in doing God’s will,—where the saints pray for this, they are found to be
praying for perseverance; since no one attains to that highest blessedness which is in the
kingdom, unless he shall persevere unto the end in that holiness which he has received on
earth.</p>

<head>Chapter 7 <del>IV.</del>—The Fourth Petition.</head>
<p>The fourth petition is, “Give us this day our daily bread,”3570 where the blessed Cyprian
shows how here also perseverance is understood to be asked for. Because he says, among
other things, “And we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we who are in
Christ, and daily receive the Eucharist for the food of salvation, may not by the interposition
of some heinous sin be separated from Christ’s body by being withheld from communicating
and prevented from partaking of the heavenly bread.”3571 These words of the holy man of
God indicate that the saints ask for perseverance directly from God, when with this intention
they say, “Give us this day our daily bread,” that they may not be separated from Christ’s
body, but may continue in that holiness in which they allow no crime by which they may
deserve to be separated from it.</p>

<head>Chapter 8 <del>V.</del>—The Fifth Petition. It is an Error of the Pelagians that the Righteous
are Free from Sin.</head>
<p>In the fifth sentence of the prayer we say, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors,”3572 in which petition alone perseverance is not found to be asked for. For the sins
which we ask to be forgiven us are past, but perseverance, which saves us for eternity, is indeed
necessary for the time of this life; but not for the time which is past, but for that which
remains even to its end. Yet it is worth the labour to consider for a little, how even already
in this petition the heretics who were to arise long after were transfixed by the tongue of
Cyprian, as if by the most invincible dart of truth. For the Pelagians dare to say even this:
that the righteous man in this life has no sin at all, and that in such men there is even at the
present time a Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,3573 which is the one
and only bride of Christ; as if she were not His bride who throughout the whole earth says
what she has learnt from Him, “Forgive us our debts.” But observe how the most glorious
Cyprian destroys these. For when he was expounding that very clause of the Lord’s Prayer,
he says among other things: “And how necessarily, how providently, and salutarily are we
admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our sins; and while
pardon is asked for from God, the soul recalls its own consciousness. Lest any one should
flatter himself that he is innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is
instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden daily to entreat for his sins.
Thus, moreover, John also in his Epistle warns3574 us, and says,3575 ‘If we say that we have
no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.’”3576 And the rest, which it would
be long to insert in this place.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—When Perseverance is Granted to a Person, He Cannot But Persevere.</head>
<p>Now, moreover, when the saints say, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil,”3577 what do they pray for but that they may persevere in holiness? For, assuredly,
when that gift of God is granted to them,—which is sufficiently plainly shown to be God’s
gift, since it is asked of Him,—that gift of God, then, being granted to them that they may
not be led into temptation, none of the saints fails to keep his perseverance in holiness even
to the end. For there is not any one who ceases to persevere in the Christian purpose unless
he is first of all led into temptation. If, therefore, it be granted to him according to his
prayer that he may not be led, certainly by the gift of God he persists in that sanctification
which by the gift of God he has received.</p>

<head>Chapter 10 <del>VI.</del>—The Gift of Perseverance Can Be Obtained by Prayer.</head>
<p>But you write that “these brethren will not have this perseverance so preached as that
it cannot be obtained by prayer or lost by obstinacy.”3578 In this they are little careful in
considering what they say. For we are speaking of that perseverance whereby one perseveres
unto the end, and if this is given, one does persevere unto the end; but if one does not persevere
unto the end, it is not given, which I have already sufficiently discussed above. Let
not men say, then, that perseverance is given to any one to the end, except when the end
itself has come, and he to whom it has been given has been found to have persevered unto
the end. Certainly, we say that one whom we have known to be chaste is chaste, whether he
should continue or not in the same chastity; and if he should have any other divine endowment
which may be kept and lost, we say that he has it as long as he has it; and if he should
lose it, we say that he had it. But since no one has perseverance to the end except he who
does persevere to the end, many people may have it, but none can lose it. For it is not to be
feared that perchance when a man has persevered unto the end, some evil will may arise in
him, so that he does not persevere unto the end. This gift of God, therefore, may be obtained
by prayer, but when it has been given, it cannot be lost by contumacy. For when any one
has persevered unto the end, he neither can lose this gift, nor others which he could lose
before the end. How, then, can that be lost, whereby it is brought about that even that which
could be lost is not lost?</p>

<p>But, lest perchance it be said that perseverance even to the end is not indeed lost when
it has once been given,—that is, when a man has persevered unto the end,—but that it is
lost, in some sense, when a man by contumacy so acts that he is not able to attain to it; just
as we say that a man who has not persevered unto the end has lost eternal life or the kingdom
of God, not because he had already received and actually had it, but because he would have
received and had it if he had persevered;—let us lay aside controversies of words, and say
that some things even which are not possessed, but are hoped to be possessed, may be lost.
Let any one who dares, tell me whether God cannot give what He has commanded to be
asked from Him. Certainly he who affirms this, I say not is a fool, but he is mad. But God
commanded that His saints should say to Him in prayer, “Lead us not into temptation.”
Whoever, therefore, is heard when he asks this, is not led into the temptation of contumacy,
whereby he could or would be worthy to lose perseverance in holiness.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Of His Own Will a Man Forsakes God, So that He is Deservedly Forsaken
of Him.</head>
<p>But, on the other hand, “of his own will a man forsakes God, so as to be deservedly
forsaken by God.” Who would deny this? But it is for that reason we ask not to be led into
temptation, so that this may not happen. And if we are heard, certainly it does not happen,
because God does not allow it to happen. For nothing comes to pass except what either He
Himself does, or Himself allows to be done. Therefore He is powerful both to turn wills
from evil to good, and to convert those that are inclined to fall, or to direct them into a way
pleasing to Himself. For to Him it is not said in vain, “O God, Thou shalt turn again and
quicken us;”3579 it is not vainly said, “Give not my foot to be moved;”3580 it is not vainly
said, “Give me not over, O Lord, from my desire to the sinner;”3581 finally, not to mention
many passages, since probably more may occur to you, it is not vainly said, “Lead us not
into temptation.”3582 For whoever is not led into temptation, certainly is not led into the
temptation of his own evil will; and he who is not led into the temptation of his own evil
will, is absolutely led into no temptation. For “every one is tempted,” as it is written, “when
he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed;”3583 “but God tempteth no man,”3584—that
is to say, with a hurtful temptation. For temptation is moreover beneficial by which we are
not deceived or overwhelmed, but proved, according to that which is said, “Prove me, O
Lord, and try me.”3585 Therefore, with that hurtful temptation which the apostle signifies
when he says, “Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in
vain,”3586 “God tempteth no man,” as I have said,—that is, He brings or leads no one into
temptation. For to be tempted and not to be led into temptation is not evil,—nay, it is even
good; for this it is to be proved. When, therefore, we say to God, “Lead us not into temptation,”
what do we say but, “Permit us not to be led”? Whence some pray in this manner,
and it is read in many codices, and the most blessed Cyprian thus uses it: “Do not suffer us
to be led into temptation.” In the Greek gospel, however, I have never found it otherwise
than, “Lead us not into temptation.” We live, therefore, more securely if we give up the
whole to God, and do not entrust ourselves partly to Him and partly to ourselves, as that
venerable martyr saw. For when he would expound the same clause of the prayer, he says

among other things, “But when we ask that we may not come into temptation, we are reminded
of our infirmity and weakness while we thus ask, lest any should insolently vaunt
himself,—lest any should proudly and arrogantly assume anything to himself,—lest any
should take to himself the glory either of confession or suffering as his own; since the Lord
Himself, teaching humility, said, ‘Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the
Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.’ So that when a humble and submissive confession
comes first and all is attributed to God, whatever is sought for suppliantly, with the
fear of God, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.”3587</p>

<p>If, then, there were no other proofs, this Lord’s Prayer alone would be sufficient for us
on behalf of the grace which I am defending; because it leaves us nothing wherein we may,
as it were, glory as in our own, since it shows that our not departing from God is not given
except by God, when it shows that it must be asked for from God. For he who is not led into
temptation does not depart from God. This is absolutely not in the strength of free will,
such as it now is; but it had been in man before he fell. And yet how much this freedom of
will availed in the excellence of that primal state appeared in the angels; who, when the
devil and his angels fell, stood in the truth, and deserved to attain to that perpetual security
of not falling, in which we are most certain that they are now established. But, after the fall
of man, God willed it to pertain only to His grace that man should approach to Him; nor
did He will it to pertain to aught but His grace that man should not depart from Him.</p>

<p>This grace He placed “in Him in whom we have obtained a lot, being predestinated according
to the purpose of Him who worketh all things.”3588 And thus as He worketh that
we come to Him, so He worketh that we do not depart. Wherefore it was said to Him by
the mouth of the prophet, “Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, and upon the
Son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself, and we will not depart from Thee.”3589
This certainly is not the first Adam, in whom we departed from Him, but the second Adam,
upon whom His hand is placed, so that we do not depart from Him. For Christ altogether
with His members is—for the Church’s sake, which is His body—the fulness of Him. When,
therefore, God’s hand is upon Him, that we depart not from God, assuredly God’s work
reaches to us (for this is God’s hand); by which work of God we are caused to be abiding in
Christ with God—not, as in Adam, departing from God. For “in Christ we have obtained
a lot, being predestinated according to His purpose who worketh all things.” This, therefore,
is God’s hand, not ours, that we depart not from God. That, I say, is His hand who said, “I

<head>Chapter 15.—Why God Willed that He Should Be Asked for that Which He Might
Give Without Prayer.</head>
<p>Wherefore, also He willed that He should be asked that we may not be led into
temptation, because if we are not led, we by no means depart from Him. And this might
have been given to us even without our praying for it, but by our prayer He willed us to be
admonished from whom we receive these benefits. For from whom do we receive but from
Him from whom it is right for us to ask? Truly in this matter let not the Church look for
laborious disputations, but consider its own daily prayers. It prays that the unbelieving may
believe; therefore God converts to the faith. It prays that believers may persevere; therefore
God gives perseverance to the end. God foreknew that He would do this. This is the very
predestination of the saints, “whom He has chosen in Christ before the foundation of the
world, that they should be holy and unspotted before Him in love; predestinating them
unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of
His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, in which He hath shown them favour in His
beloved Son, in whom they have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins according
to the riches of His grace, which has abounded towards them in all wisdom and
prudence; that He might show them the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure
which He hath purposed in Him, in the dispensation of the fulness of times to restore all
things in Christ which are in heaven and which are in earth; in Him, in whom also we have
obtained a lot, being predestinated according to His purpose who worketh all things.”3591

<p>But “why,” says one, “is not the grace of God given according to men’s merits?” I answer,
Because God is merciful. “Why, then,” it is asked, “is it not given to all?” And here I reply,
Because God is a Judge.3592 And thus grace is given by Him freely; and by His righteous
judgment it is shown in some what grace confers on those to whom it is given. Let us not
then be ungrateful, that according to the good pleasure of His will a merciful God delivers
so many to the praise of the glory of His grace from such deserved perdition; as, if He should
deliver no one therefrom, He would not be unrighteous. Let him, therefore, who is delivered
love His grace. Let him who is not delivered acknowledge his due. If, in remitting a debt,
goodness is perceived, in requiring it, justice—unrighteousness is never found to be with
God.</p>

<p>“But why,” it is said, “in one and the same case, not only of infants, but even of twin
children, is the judgment so diverse?” Is it not a similar question, “Why in a different case
is the judgment the same?” Let us recall, then, those labourers in the vineyard who worked
the whole day, and those who toiled one hour. Certainly the case was different as to the labour
expended, and yet there was the same judgment in paying the wages. Did the murmurers
in this case hear anything from the householder except, Such is my will? Certainly such was
his liberality towards some, that there could be no injustice towards others. And both these
classes, indeed, are among the good. Nevertheless, so far as it concerns justice and grace, it
may be truly said to the guilty who is condemned, also concerning the guilty who is delivered,
“Take what thine is, and go thy way;”3593 “I will give unto this one that which is not due;”
“Is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thine eye evil because I am good?” And how if
he should say, “Why not to me also?” He will hear, and with reason, “Who art thou, O man,
that repliest against God?”3594 And although assuredly in the one case you see a most benignant
benefactor, and in your own case a most righteous exactor, in neither case do you behold
an unjust God. For although He would be righteous even if He were to punish both, he who
is delivered has good ground for thankfulness, he who is condemned has no ground for
finding fault.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Why Does God Mingle Those Who Will Persevere with Those Who
Will Not?</head>
<p>Let the inquirer still go on, and say, “Why is it that to some who have in good faith
worshipped Him He has not given to persevere to the end?” Why except because he does
not speak falsely who says, “They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
been of us, doubtless they would have continued with us.”3595 Are there, then, two natures
of men? By no means. If there were two natures there would not be any grace, for there
would be given a gratuitous deliverance to none if it were paid as a debt to nature. But it
seems to men that all who appear good believers ought to receive perseverance to the end.
But God has judged it to be better to mingle some who would not persevere with a certain
number of His saints, so that those for whom security from temptation in this life is not
desirable may not be secure. For that which the apostle says, checks many from mischievous
elation: “Wherefore let him who seems to stand take heed lest he fall.”3596 But he who falls,
falls by his own will, and he who stands, stands by God’s will. “For God is able to make him
stand;”3597 therefore he is not able to make himself stand, but God. Nevertheless, it is good
not to be high-minded, but to fear. Moreover, it is in his own thought that every one either
falls or stands. Now, as the apostle says, and as I have mentioned in my former treatise, “We
are not sufficient to think anything of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.”3598 Following
whom also the blessed Ambrose ventures to say, “For our heart is not in our own power,
nor are our thoughts.” And this everybody who is humbly and truly pious feels to be most
true.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Ambrose on God’s Control Over Men’s Thoughts.</head>
<p>And when Ambrose said this, he was speaking in that treatise which he wrote concerning
Flight from the World, wherein he taught that this world was to be fled not by the body,
but by the heart, which he argued could not be done except by God’s help. For he says: “We
hear frequent discourse concerning fleeing from this world, and I would that the mind was
as careful and solicitous as the discourse is easy; but what is worse, the enticement of earthly
lusts constantly creeps in, and the pouring out of vanities takes possession of the mind; so
that what you desire to avoid, this you think of and consider in your mind. And this is difficult
for a man to beware of, but impossible to get rid of. Finally, the prophet bears witness that
it is a matter of wish rather than of accomplishment, when he says, ‘Incline my heart to Thy
testimonies, and not to covetousness.’3599 For our heart and our thoughts are not in our
own power, and these, poured forth unexpectedly, confuse our mind and soul, and draw
them in a different direction from that which you have proposed to yourself; they recall you
to worldly things, they interpose things of time, they suggest voluptuous things, they inweave
enticing things, and in the very moment when we are seeking to elevate our mind, we are
for the most part filled with vain thoughts and cast down to earthly things.”3600 Therefore
it is not in the power of men, but in that of God, that men have power to become sons of
God.3601 Because they receive it from Him who gives pious thoughts to the human heart,
by which it has faith, which worketh by love;3602 for the receiving and keeping of which
benefit, and for carrying it on perseveringly unto the end, we are not sufficient to think
anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,3603 in whose power is our heart and
our thoughts.</p>

<head>Chapter 21 <del>IX.</del>—Instances of the Unsearchable Judgments of God.</head>
<p>Therefore, of two infants, equally bound by original sin, why the one is taken and the
other left; and of two wicked men of already mature years, why this one should be so called
as to follow Him that calleth, while that one is either not called at all, or is not called in such
a manner,—the judgments of God are unsearchable. But of two pious men, why to the one
should be given perseverance unto the end, and to the other it should not be given, God’s
judgments are even more unsearchable. Yet to believers it ought to be a most certain fact
that the former is of the predestinated, the latter is not. “For if they had been of us,” says
one of the predestinated, who had drunk this secret from the breast of the Lord, “certainly
they would have continued with us.”3604 What, I ask, is the meaning of, “They were not of
us; for if they had been of us, they would certainly have continued with us”? Were not both
created by God—both born of Adam—both made from the earth, and given from Him who
said, “I have created all breath,”3605 souls of one and the same nature? Lastly, had not both
been called, and followed Him that called them? and had not both become, from wicked
men, justified men, and both been renewed by the laver of regeneration? But if he were to
hear this who beyond all doubt knew what he was saying, he might answer and say: These
things are true. In respect of all these things, they were of us. Nevertheless, in respect of a
certain other distinction, they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they certainly would
have continued with us. What then is this distinction? God’s books lie open, let us not turn
away our view; the divine Scripture cries aloud, let us give it a hearing. They were not of
them, because they had not been “called according to the purpose;” they had not been chosen
in Christ before the foundation of the world; they had not gained a lot in Him; they had not
been predestinated according to His purpose who worketh all things. For if they had been
this, they would have been of them, and without doubt they would have continued with
them.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—It is an Absurdity to Say that the Dead Will Be Judged for Sins Which
They Would Have Committed If They Had Lived.</head>
<p>For not to say how possible it may be for God to convert the wills of men averse and
opposed to His faith, and to operate on their hearts so that they yield to no adversities, and
are overcome by no temptation so as to depart from Him,—since He also can do what the
apostle says, namely, not allow them to be tempted above that which they are able;—not,
then, to say this, God foreknowing that they would fall, was certainly able to take them away
from this life before that fall should occur. Are we to return to that point of still arguing
how absurdly it is said that dead men are judged even for those sins which God foreknew
that they would have committed if they had lived? which is so abhorrent to the feelings of
Christians, or even of human beings, that one is even ashamed to rebut it. Why should it
not be said that even the gospel itself has been preached, with so much labour and sufferings
of the saints, in vain, or is even still preached in vain, if men could be judged, even without
hearing the gospel, according to the contumacy or obedience which God foreknew that they
would have had if they had heard it? Tyre and Sidon would not have been condemned, although
more slightly than those cities in which, although they did not believe, wonderful
works were done by Christ the Lord; because if they had been done in them, they would
have repented in dust and ashes, as the utterances of the Truth declare, in which words of
His the Lord Jesus shows to us the loftier mystery of predestination.</p>

<pb n="1435"/>
<head>Chapter 23.—Why for the People of Tyre and Sidon, Who Would Have Believed,
the Miracles Were Not Done Which Were Done in Other Places Which Did Not
Believe.</head>
<p>For if we are asked why such miracles were done among those who, when they saw
them, would not believe them, and were not done among those who would have believed
them if they had seen them, what shall we answer? Shall we say what I have said in that
book3606 wherein I answered some six questions of the Pagans, yet without prejudice of
other matters which the wise can inquire into? This indeed I said, as you know, when it was
asked why Christ came after so long a time: “that at those times and in those places in which
His gospel was not preached, He foreknew that all men would, in regard of His preaching,
be such as many were in His bodily presence,—people, namely, who would not believe on
Him, even though the dead were raised by Him.” Moreover, a little after in the same book,
and on the same question, I say, “What wonder, if Christ knew in former ages that the world
was so filled with unbelievers, that He was, with reason, unwilling for His gospel to be
preached to them whom He foreknew to be such as would not believe either His words or
His miracles”? Certainly we cannot say this of Tyre and Sidon; and in their case we recognise
that those divine judgments had reference to those causes of predestination, without prejudice
to which hidden causes I said that I was then answering such questions as those. Certainly
it is easy to accuse the unbelief of the Jews, arising as it did from their free will, since they
refused to believe in such great wonders done among themselves. And this the Lord, reproaching
them, declares when He says, “Woe unto thee, Chorazin and Bethsaida, because
if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they
would long ago have repented in dust and ashes.”3607 But can we say that even the Tyrians
and Sidonians would have refused to believe such mighty works done among them, or would
not have believed them if they had been done, when the Lord Himself bears witness to them
that they would have repented with great humility if those signs of divine power had been
done among them? And yet in the day of judgment they will be punished; although with a
less punishment than those cities which would not believe the mighty works done in them.
For the Lord goes on to say, “Nevertheless, I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.”3608 Therefore the former shall be punished
with greater severity, the latter with less; but yet they shall be punished. Again, if the dead
are judged even in respect of deeds which they would have done if they had lived, assuredly
since these would have been believers if the gospel had been preached to them with so great
miracles, they certainly ought not to be punished; but they will be punished. It is therefore

<pb n="1436"/>
false that the dead are judged in respect also of those things which they would have done if
the gospel had reached them when they were alive. And if this is false, there is no ground
for saying, concerning infants who perish because they die without baptism, that this happens
in their case deservedly, because God foreknew that if they should live and the gospel should
be preached to them, they would hear it with unbelief. It remains, therefore, that they are
kept bound by original sin alone, and for this alone they go into condemnation; and we see
that in others in the same case this is not remitted, except by the gratuitous grace of God in
regeneration; and that, by His secret yet righteous judgment—because there is no unrighteousness
with God—that some, who even after baptism will perish by evil living, are yet
kept in this life until they perish, who would not have perished if bodily death had forestalled
their lapse into sin, and so come to their help. Because no dead man is judged by the good
or evil things which he would have done if he had not died, otherwise the Tyrians and
Sidonians would not have suffered the penalties according to what they did; but rather according
to those things that they would have done, if those evangelical mighty works had
been done in them, they would have obtained salvation by great repentance, and by the faith
of Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 24 <del>X.</del>—It May Be Objected that The People of Tyre and Sidon Might, If
They Had Heard, Have Believed, and Have Subsequently Lapsed from Their
Faith.</head>
<p>A certain catholic disputant of no mean reputation so expounded this passage of the
gospel as to say, that the Lord foreknew that the Tyrians and Sidonians would have afterwards
departed from the faith, although they had believed the miracles done among them; and
that in mercy He did not work those miracles there, because they would have been liable to
severer punishment if they had forsaken the faith which they had once held, than if they
had at no time held it. In which opinion of a learned and exceedingly acute man, why am I
now concerned to say what is still reasonably to be asked, when even this opinion serves me
for the purpose at which I aim? For if the Lord in His mercy did not do mighty works among
them, since by these works they might possibly become believers, so that they might not be
more severely punished when they should subsequently become unbelievers, as He foreknew
that they would,—it is sufficiently and plainly shown that no dead person is judged for those
sins which He foreknew that he would have done, if in some manner he were not helped
not to do them; just as Christ is said to have come to the aid of the Tyrians and Sidonians,
if that opinion be true, who He would rather should not come to the faith at all, than that
by a much greater wickedness they should depart from the faith, as, if they had come to it,
He foresaw they would have done. Although if it be said, “Why was it not provided that
they should rather believe, and this gift should be bestowed on them, that before they forsook
the faith they should depart from this life”? I am ignorant what reply can be made. For he
who says that to those who would forsake their faith it would have been granted, as a kindness,
that they should not begin to have what, by a more serious impiety, they would subsequently
forsake, sufficiently indicates that a man is not judged by that which it is foreknown
he would have done ill, if by any act of kindness he may be prevented from doing it.
Therefore it is an advantage also to him who is taken away, lest wickedness should alter his
understanding. But why this advantage should not have been given to the Tyrians and
Sidonians, that they might believe and be taken away, lest wickedness should alter their
understanding, he perhaps might answer who was pleased in such a way to solve the above
question; but, as far as concerns what I am discussing, I see it to be enough that, even according
to that very opinion, men are shown not to be judged in respect of those things which
they have not done, even although they may have been foreseen as certain to have done
them. However, as I have said, let us think shame even to refute this opinion, whereby sins
are supposed to be punished in people who die or have died because they have been foreknown
as certain to do them if they had lived; lest we also may seem to have thought it to
be of some importance, although we would rather repress it by argument than pass it over
in silence.</p>

<head>Chapter 25 <del>XI.</del>—God’s Ways, Both in Mercy and Judgment, Past Finding Out.</head>
<p>Accordingly, as says the apostle, “It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that showeth mercy,”3609 who both comes to the help of such infants as He will,
although they neither will nor run, since He chose them in Christ before the foundation of
the world as those to whom He intended to give His grace freely,—that is, with no merits
of theirs, either of faith or of works, preceding; and does not come to the help of those who
are more mature, although He foresaw that they would believe His miracles if they should
be done among them, because He wills not to come to their help, since in His predestination
He, secretly indeed, but yet righteously, has otherwise determined concerning them. For
“there is no unrighteousness with God;”3610 but “His judgments are unsearchable, and His
ways are past finding out; all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth.”3611 Therefore the
mercy is past finding out by which He has mercy on whom He will, no merits of his own
preceding; and the truth is unsearchable by which He hardeneth whom He will, even although
his merits may have preceded, but merits for the most part common to him with the man
on whom He has mercy. As of two twins, of which one is taken and the other left, the end
is unequal, while the deserts are common, yet in these the one is in such wise delivered by
God’s great goodness, that the other is condemned by no injustice of God’s. For is there
unrighteousness with God? Away with the thought! but His ways are past finding out.
Therefore let us believe in His mercy in the case of those who are delivered, and in His truth
in the case of those who are punished, without any hesitation; and let us not endeavour to
look into that which is inscrutable, nor to trace that which cannot be found out. Because
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings He perfects His praise,3612 so that what we see in
those whose deliverance is preceded by no good deservings of theirs, and in those whose
condemnation is only preceded by original sin, common alike to both,—this we by no means
shrink from as occurring in the case of grown-up people, that is, because we do not think
either that grace is given to any one according to his own merits, or that any one is punished
except for his own merits, whether they are alike who are delivered and who are punished,
or have unequal degrees of evil; so that he who thinketh he standeth may take heed lest he
fall, and he who glorieth may glory not in himself, but in the Lord.</p>

or rather by his own sacrilege, takes what he likes, and rejects what he does not like,—in
opposition to whom I treated in my writings on Free Will, whence they think that they have

questions that occurred, lest my work should become too long, in a case which, as opposed
to such perverse men, I could not have the assistance of the authority of the sacred
Scriptures. And I was able,—as I actually did, whether anything of the divine testimonies
might be true or not, seeing that I did not definitely introduce them into the argument,—nevertheless,
by certain reasoning, to conclude that God in all things is to be praised, without
any necessity of believing, as they would have us, that there are two co-eternal, confounded
substances of good and evil.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Reference to the “Retractations.”</head>
<p>Finally, in the first book of the Retractations,3614which work of mine you have not yet
read, when I had come to the reconsidering of those same books, that is, on the subject of
Free Will, I thus spoke: “In these books,” I say, “many things were so discussed that on the
occurring of some questions which either I was not able to elucidate, or which required a
long discussion at once, they were so deferred as that from either side, or from all sides, of
those questions in which what was most in harmony with the truth did not appear, yet my
reasoning might be conclusive for this, namely, that whichever of them might be true, God
might be believed, or even be shown, to be worthy of praise. Because that discussion was
undertaken for the sake of those who deny that the origin of evil is derived from the free
choice of the will, and contend that God,—if He be so,—as the Creator of all natures, is
worthy of blame; desiring in that manner, according to the error of their impiety (for they
are Manicheans), to introduce a certain immutable nature of evil co-eternal with God.”
Also, after a little time, in another place I say: “Then it was said, From this misery, most
righteously inflicted on sinners, God’s grace delivers, because man of his own accord, that
is, by free will, could fall, but could not also rise. To this misery of just condemnation belong
the ignorance and the difficulty which every man suffers from the beginning of his birth,
and no one is delivered from that evil except by the grace of God. And this misery the
Pelagians will not have to descend from a just condemnation, because they deny original
sin; although even if the ignorance and difficulty were the natural beginnings of man, God
would not even thus deserve to be reproached, but to be praised, as I have argued in the
same third book.3615 Which argument must be regarded as against the Manicheans, who
do not receive the holy Scriptures of the Old Testament, in which original sin is narrated;
and whatever thence is read in the apostolic epistles, they contend was introduced with a
detestable impudence by the corrupters of the Scriptures, assuming that it was not said by
the apostles. But against the Pelagians that must be maintained which both Scriptures
commend, as they profess to receive them.” These things I said in my first book of Retractations,
when I was reconsidering the books on Free Will. Nor, indeed, were these things all
that were said by me there about these books, but there were many others also, which I
thought it would be tedious to insert in this work for you, and not necessary; and this I think
you also will judge when you have read all. Although, therefore, in the third book on Free
Will I have in such wise argued concerning infants, that even if what the Pelagians say were
true,—that ignorance and difficulty, without which no man is born, are elements, not punishments,
of our nature,—still the Manicheans would be overcome, who will have it that
the two natures, to wit, of good and evil, are co-eternal. Is, therefore, the faith to be called

in question or forsaken, which the catholic Church maintains against those very Pelagians,
asserting as she does that it is original sin, the guilt of which, contracted by generation, must
be remitted by regeneration? And if they confess this with us, so that we may at once, in
this matter of the Pelagians, destroy error, why do they think that it must be doubted that
God can deliver even infants, to whom He gives His grace by the sacrament of baptism,
from the power of darkness, and translate them into the kingdom of the Son of His love?3616
In the fact, therefore, that He gives that grace to some, and does not give it to others, why
will they not sing to the Lord His mercy and judgment?3617 Why, however, is it given to
these, rather than to those,—who has known the mind of the Lord? who is able to look into
unsearchable things? who to trace out that which is past finding out?</p>

<head>Chapter 28 <del>XII.</del>—God’s Goodness and Righteousness Shown in All.</head>
<p>It is therefore settled that God’s grace is not given according to the deserts of the recipients,
but according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise and glory of His own
grace; so that he who glorieth may by no means glory in himself, but in the Lord, who gives
to those men to whom He will, because He is merciful, what if, however, He does not give,
He is righteous: and He does not give to whom He will not, that He may make known the
riches of His glory to the vessels of mercy.3618 For by giving to some what they do not deserve,
He has certainly willed that His grace should be gratuitous, and thus genuine grace; by not
giving to all, He has shown what all deserve. Good in His goodness to some, righteous in
the punishment of others; both good in respect of all, because it is good when that which is
due is rendered, and righteous in respect of all, since that which is not due is given without
wrong to any one.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—God’s True Grace Could Be Defended Even If There Were No Original
Sin, as Pelagius Maintains.</head>
<p>But God’s grace, that is, true grace without merits, is maintained, even if infants, when
baptized, according to the view of the Pelagians, are not plucked out of the power of darkness,
because they are held guilty of no sin, as the Pelagians think, but are only transferred into
the Lord’s kingdom: for even thus, without any good merits, the kingdom is given to those
to whom it is given; and without any evil merits it is not given to them to whom it is not
given. And this we are in the habit of saying in opposition to the same Pelagians, when they
object to us that we attribute God’s grace to fate, when we say that it is given not in respect
to our merits. For they themselves rather attribute God’s grace to fate in the case of infants,
if they say that when there is no merit it is fate.3619 Certainly, even according to the Pelagians
themselves, no merits can be found in infants to cause that some of them should be admitted
into the kingdom, and others should be alienated from the kingdom. But now, just as in
order to show that God’s grace is not given according to our merits, I preferred to maintain
this truth in accordance with both opinions,—both in accordance with our own, to wit, who
say that infants are bound by original sin, and according to that of the Pelagians, who deny
that there is original sin, and yet I cannot on that account doubt that infants have what He
can pardon them who saves His people from their sins: so in the third book on Free Will,
according to both views, I have withstood the Manicheans, whether ignorance and difficulty
be punishments or elements of nature without which no man is born; and yet I hold one of
these views. There, moreover, it is sufficiently evidently declared by me, that that is not the
nature of man as he was ordained, but his punishment as condemned.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—Augustin Claims the Right to Grow in Knowledge.</head>
<p>Therefore it is in vain that it is prescribed to me from that old book of mine, that I may
not argue the case as I ought to argue it in respect of infants; and that thence I may not
persuade my opponents by the light of a manifest truth, that God’s grace is not given accord-
ing to men’s merits. For if, when I began my books concerning Free Will as a layman, and
finished them as a presbyter, I still doubted of the condemnation of infants not born again,
and of the deliverance of infants that were born again, no one, as I think, would be so unfair
and envious as to hinder my progress, and judge that I must continue in that uncertainty.
But it can more correctly be understood that it ought to be believed that I did not doubt in
that matter, for the reason that they against whom my purpose was directed seemed to me
in such wise to be rebutted, as that whether there was a punishment of original sin in infants,
according to the truth, or whether there was not, as some mistaken people think, yet in no
degree should such a confusion of the two natures be believed in, to wit, of good and evil,
as the error of the Manicheans introduces. Be it therefore far from us so to forsake the case
of infants as to say to ourselves that it is uncertain whether, being regenerated in Christ, if
they die in infancy they pass into eternal salvation; but that, not being regenerated, they
pass into the second death. Because that which is written, “By one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men,”3620 cannot be rightly understood
in any other manner; nor from that eternal death which is most righteously repaid to sin
does any deliver any one, small or great, save He who, for the sake of remitting our sins,
both original and personal, died without any sin of His own, either original or personal. But
why some rather than others? Again and again we say, and do not shrink from it, “O man,
who art thou that repliest against God?”3621 “His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways
past finding out.”3622 And let us add this, “Seek not out the things that are too high for thee,
and search not the things that are above thy strength.”3623</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Infants are Not Judged According to that Which They are Foreknown
as Likely to Do If They Should Live.</head>
<p>For you see, beloved, how absurd it is, and how foreign from soundness of faith and
sincerity of truth, for us to say that infants, when they die, should be judged according to
those things which they are foreknown to be going to do if they should live. For to this
opinion, from which certainly every human feeling, on however little reason it may be
founded, and especially every Christian feeling, revolts, they are compelled to advance who
have chosen in such wise to be withdrawn from the error of the Pelagians as still to think
that they must believe, and, moreover, must profess in argument, that the grace of God,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, by which alone after the fall of the first man, in whom we
all fell, help is afforded to us, is given according to our merits. And this belief Pelagius
himself, before the Eastern bishops as judges, condemned in fear of his own condemnation.
And if this be not said of the good or bad works of those who have died, which they would
have done if they had lived,—and thus of no works, and works that would never exist, even
in the foreknowledge of God,—if this, therefore, be not said, and you see under how great
a mistake it is said, what will remain but that we confess, when the darkness of contention
is removed, that the grace of God is not given according to our merits, which position the
catholic Church defends against the Pelagian heresy; and that we see this in more evident
truth especially in infants? For God is not compelled by fate to come to the help of these
infants, and not to come to the help of those,—since the case is alike to both. Or shall we
think that human affairs in the case of infants are not managed by Divine Providence, but
by fortuitous chances, when rational souls are either to be condemned or delivered, although,
indeed, not a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of our Father which is in heaven?
3624 Or must we so attribute it to the negligence of parents that infants die without
baptism, as that heavenly judgments have nothing to do with it; as if they themselves who
in this way die badly had of their own will chosen the negligent parents for themselves of
whom they were born? What shall I say when an infant expires some time before he can
possibly be advantaged by the ministry of baptism? For often when the parents are eager
and the ministers prepared for giving baptism to the infants, it still is not given, because
God does not choose; since He has not kept it in this life for a little while in order that baptism
might be given it. What, moreover, when sometimes aid could be afforded by baptism to
the children of unbelievers, that they should not go into perdition, and could not be afforded
to the children of believers? In which case it is certainly shown that there is no acceptance
of persons with God; otherwise He would rather deliver the children of His worshippers
than the children of His enemies.</p>

<head>Chapter 32 <del>XIII.</del>—The Inscrutability of God’s Free Purposes.</head>
<p>But now, since we are now treating of the gift of perseverance, why is it that aid is afforded
to the person about to die who is not baptized, while to the baptized person about
to fall, aid is not afforded, so as to die before? Unless, perchance, we shall still listen to that
absurdity by which it is said that it is of no advantage to any one to die before his fall, because
he will be judged according to those actions which God foreknew that he would have done
if he had lived. Who can hear with patience this perversity, so violently opposed to the
soundness of the faith? Who can bear it? And yet they are driven to say this who do not
confess that God’s grace is not bestowed in respect of our deservings. They, however, who
will not say that any one who has died is judged according to those things which God
foreknew that he would have done if he had lived, considering with how manifest a falsehood
and how great an absurdity this would be said, have no further reason to say, what the
Church condemned in the Pelagians, and caused to be condemned by Pelagius himself,—that
the grace of God, namely, is given according to our merits,—when they see some infants
not regenerated taken from this life to eternal death, and others regenerated, to eternal life;
and those themselves that are regenerated, some going hence, persevering even to the end,
and others kept in this life even until they fall, who certainly would not have fallen if they
had departed hence before their lapse; and again some falling, but not departing from this
life until they return, who certainly would have perished if they had departed before their
return.</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—God Gives Both Initiatory and Persevering Grace According to His
Own Will.</head>
<p>From all which it is shown with sufficient clearness that the grace of God, which both
begins a man’s faith and which enables it to persevere unto the end, is not given according
to our merits, but is given according to His own most secret and at the same time most
righteous, wise, and beneficent will; since those whom He predestinated, them He also
called,3625 with that calling of which it is said, “The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.”
3626 To which calling there is no man that can be said by men with any certainty
of affirmation to belong, until he has departed from this world; but in this life of man, which
is a state of trial upon the earth,3627 he who seems to stand must take heed lest he fall.3628
Since (as I have already said before)3629 those who will not persevere are, by the most foreseeing
will of God, mingled with those who will persevere, for the reason that we may learn
not to mind high things, but to consent to the lowly, and may “work out our own salvation
with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do for His good
pleasure.”3630 We therefore will, but God worketh in us to will also. We therefore work, but
God worketh in us to work also for His good pleasure. This is profitable for us both to believe
and to say,—this is pious, this is true, that our confession be lowly and submissive, and that
all should be given to God. Thinking, we believe; thinking, we speak; thinking, we do whatever
we do;3631 but, in respect of what concerns the way of piety and the true worship of God,
we are not sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.3632 For
“our heart and our thoughts are not in our own power;” whence the same Ambrose who
says this says also: “But who is so blessed as in his heart always to rise upwards? And how
can this be done without divine help? Assuredly, by no means. Finally,” he says, “the same
Scripture affirms above, ‘Blessed is the man whose help is of Thee; O Lord,3633 ascent is in
his heart.’”3634 Assuredly, Ambrose was not only enabled to say this by reading in the holy
writings, but as of such a man is to be without doubt believed, he felt it also in his own heart.

Therefore, as is said in the sacraments of believers, that we should lift up our hearts to the
Lord, is God’s gift; for which gift they to whom this is said are admonished by the priest
after this word to give thanks to our Lord God Himself; and they answer that it is “meet and
right so to do.” 3635 For, since our heart is not in our own power, but is lifted up by the divine
help, so that it ascends and takes cognizance of those things which are above,3636 where
Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, and, not those things that are upon the earth, to
whom are thanks to be given for so great a gift as this unless to our Lord God who doeth
this,—who in so great kindness has chosen us by delivering us from the abyss of this world,
and has predestinated us before the foundation of the world?</p>

<head>Chapter 34 <del>XIV.</del>—The Doctrine of Predestination Not Opposed to the Advantage
of Preaching.</head>
<p>But they say that the “definition of predestination is opposed to the advantage of
preaching,”3637—as if, indeed, it were opposed to the preaching of the apostle! Did not that
teacher of the heathen so often, in faith and truth, both commend predestination, and not
cease to preach the word of God? Because he said, “It is God that worketh in you both to
will and to do for His good pleasure,”3638 did he not also exhort that we should both will
and do what is pleasing to God? or because he said, “He who hath begun a good work in
you shall carry it on even unto the day of Christ Jesus,”3639 did he on that account cease to
persuade men to begin and to persevere unto the end? Doubtless, our Lord Himself commanded
men to believe, and said, “Believe in God, believe also in me:”3640 and yet His
opinion is not therefore false, nor is His definition idle when He says, “No man cometh
unto me”—that is, no man believeth in me—“except it has been given him of my Father.”3641
Nor, again, because this definition is true, is the former precept vain. Why, therefore, do
we think the definition of predestination useless to preaching, to precept, to exhortation,
to rebuke,—all which things the divine Scripture repeats frequently,—seeing that the same
Scripture commends this doctrine?</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—What Predestination is.</head>
<p>Will any man dare to say that God did not foreknow those to whom He would give to
believe, or whom He would give to His Son, that of them He should lose none?3642 And
certainly, if He foreknew these things, He as certainly foreknew His own kindnesses,
wherewith He condescends to deliver us. This is the predestination of the saints,—nothing
else; to wit, the foreknowledge and the preparation of God’s kindnesses, whereby they are
most certainly delivered, whoever they are that are delivered. But where are the rest left by
the righteous divine judgment except in the mass of ruin, where the Tyrians and the Sidonians
were left? who, moreover, might have believed if they had seen Christ’s wonderful miracles.
But since it was not given to them to believe, the means of believing also were denied them.
From which fact it appears that some have in their understanding itself a naturally divine
gift of intelligence, by which they may be moved to the faith, if they either hear the words
or behold the signs congruous to their minds; and yet if, in the higher judgment of God,
they are not by the predestination of grace separated from the mass of perdition, neither
those very divine words nor deeds are applied to them by which they might believe if they
only heard or saw such things. Moreover, in the same mass of ruin the Jews were left, because
they could not believe such great and eminent mighty works as were done in their sight.
For the gospel has not been silent about the reason why they could not believe, since it says:
“But though He had done such great miracles before them, yet they believed not on Him;
that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake,3643 Lord, who hath
believed our report, and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? And, therefore,
they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,3644 He hath blinded their eyes and
hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their
heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.”3645 Therefore the eyes of the Tyrians and
Sidonians were not so blinded nor was their heart so hardened, since they would have believed
if they had seen such mighty works, as the Jews saw. But it did not profit them that they
were able to believe, because they were not predestinated by Him whose judgments are inscrutable
and His ways past finding out. Neither would inability to believe have been a
hindrance to them, if they had been so predestinated as that God should illuminate those
blind eyes, and should will to take away the stony heart from those hardened ones. But what
the Lord said of the Tyrians and Sidonians may perchance be understood in another way:
that no one nevertheless comes to Christ unless it were given him, and that it is given to
those who are chosen in Him before the foundation of the world, he confesses beyond a

doubt who hears the divine utterance, not with the deaf ears of the flesh, but with the ears
of the heart; and yet this predestination, which is plainly enough unfolded even by the words
of the gospels, did not prevent the Lord’s saying as well in respect of the commencement,
what I have a little before mentioned, “Believe in God; believe also in me,” as in respect of
perseverance, “A man ought always to pray, and not to faint.”3646 For they hear these things
and do them to whom it is given; but they do them not, whether they hear or do not hear,
to whom it is not given. Because, “To you,” said He, “it is given to know the mystery of the
kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.”3647 Of these, the one refers to the mercy,
the other to the judgment of Him to whom our soul cries, “I will sing of mercy and judgment
unto Thee, O Lord.”3648</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—The Preaching of the Gospel and the Preaching of Predestination the
Two Parts of One Message.</head>
<p>Therefore, by the preaching of predestination, the preaching of a persevering and progressive
faith is not to be hindered; and thus they may hear what is necessary to whom it is
given that they should obey. For how shall they hear without a preacher? Neither, again, is
the preaching of a progressive faith which continues even to the end to hinder the preaching
of predestination, so that he who is living faithfully and obediently may not be lifted up by
that very obedience, as if by a benefit of his own, not received; but that he that glorieth may
glory in the Lord. For “we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.” And this,
Cyprian most faithfully saw and most fearlessly explained, and thus he pronounced predestination
to be most assured.3649 For if we must boast in nothing, seeing that nothing is our
own, certainly we must not boast of the most persevering obedience. Nor is it so to be called
our own, as if it were not given to us from above. And, therefore, it is God’s gift, which, by
the confession of all Christians, God foreknew that He would give to His people, who were
called by that calling whereof it was said, “The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.”
3650 This, then, is the predestination which we faithfully and humbly preach. Nor yet
did the same teacher and doer, who both believed on Christ and most perseveringly lived
in holy obedience, even to suffering for Christ, cease on that account to preach the gospel,
to exhort to faith and to pious manners, and to that very perseverance to the end, because
he said, “We must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own;” and here he declared without
ambiguity the true grace of God, that is, that which is not given in respect of our merits;
and since God foreknew that He would give it, predestination was announced beyond a
doubt by these words of Cyprian; and if this did not prevent Cyprian from preaching
obedience, it certainly ought not to prevent us.</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—Ears to Hear are a Willingness to Obey.</head>
<p>Although, therefore, we say that obedience is the gift of God, we still exhort men to it.
But to those who obediently hear the exhortation of truth is given the gift of God itself—that
is, to hear obediently; while to those who do not thus hear it is not given. For it was not
some one only, but Christ who said, “No man cometh unto me, except it were given him of
my Father;”3651 and, “To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but
to them it is not given.”3652 And concerning continence He says, “Not all receive this saying,
but they to whom it is given.”3653 And when the apostle would exhort married people to
conjugal chastity, he says, “I would that all men were even as I myself; but every man hath
his proper gift of God, one after this manner, another after that;”3654 where he plainly shows
not only that continence is a gift of God, but even the chastity of those who are married.
And although these things are true, we still exhort to them as much as is given to any one
of us to be able to exhort, because this also is His gift in whose hand are both ourselves and
our discourses. Whence also says the apostle, “According to this grace of God which is given
unto me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation.” 3655 And in another place he says,
“Even as the Lord hath given to every man: I have planted, Apollos has watered, but God
has given the increase. Therefore neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth,
but God that giveth the increase.”3656 And thus as only he preaches and exhorts rightly who
has received this gift, so assuredly he who obediently hears him who rightly exhorts and
preaches is he who has received this gift. Hence is what the Lord said, when, speaking to
those who had their fleshly ears open, He nevertheless told them, “He that hath ears to hear
let him hear;”3657 which beyond a doubt he knew that not all had. And from whom they
have, whosoever they be that have them, the Lord Himself shows when He says, “I will give
them a heart to know me, and ears to hear.”3658 Therefore, having ears is itself the gift of
obeying, so that they who had that came to Him, to whom “no one comes unless it were
given to him of His Father.” Therefore we exhort and preach, but they who have ears to
hear obediently hear us, while in them who have them not, it comes to pass what is written,
that hearing they do not hear,—hearing, to wit, with the bodily sense, they do not hear with
the assent of the heart. But why these should have ears to hear, and those have them not,—that

<head>Chapter 38 <del>XV.</del>—Against the Preaching of Predestination the Same Objections
May Be Alleged as Against Predestination.</head>
<p>But they say, as you write: “That no one can be aroused by the incentives of rebuke if it
be said in the assembly of the Church to the multitude of hearers: The definite meaning of
God’s will concerning predestination stands in such wise, that some of you will receive the
will to obey and will come out of unbelief unto faith, or will receive perseverance and abide
in the faith; but others who are lingering in the delight of sins have not yet arisen, for the
reason that the aid of pitying grace has not yet indeed raised you up. But yet, if there are
any whom by His grace He has predestinated to be chosen, who are not yet called, ye shall
receive that grace by which you may will and be chosen; and if any obey, if ye are predestinated
to be rejected, the strength to obey shall be withdrawn from you, so that you may cease
to obey.” Although these things may be said, they ought not so to deter us from confessing
the true grace of God,—that is, the grace which is not given to us in respect of our merits,—
and from confessing the predestination of the saints in accordance therewith, even as
we are not deterred from confessing God’s foreknowledge, although one should thus speak
to the people concerning it, and say: “Whether you are now living righteously or unrighteously,
you shall be such by and by as the Lord has foreknown that you will be,—either
good, if He has foreknown you as good, or bad, if He has foreknown you as bad.” For if on
the hearing of this some should be turned to torpor and slothfulness, and from striving
should go headlong to lust after their own desires, is it therefore to be counted that what
has been said about the foreknowledge of God is false? If God has foreknown that they will
be good, will they not be good, whatever be the depth of evil in which they are now engaged?
And if He has foreknown them evil, will they not be evil, whatever goodness may now be
discerned in them? There was a man in our monastery, who, when the brethren rebuked
him for doing some things that ought not to be done, and for not doing some things that
ought to be done, replied, “Whatever I may now be, I shall be such as God has foreknown
that I shall be.” And this man certainly both said what was true, and was not profited by
this truth for good, but so far made way in evil as to desert the society of the monastery, and
become a dog returned to his vomit; and, nevertheless, it is uncertain what he is yet to become.
For the sake of souls of this kind, then, is the truth which is spoken about God’s
foreknowledge either to be denied or to be kept back,—at such times, for instance, when, if
it is not spoken, other errors are incurred?</p>

<p>There are some, moreover, who either do not pray at all, or pray coldly, because, from
the Lord’s words, they have learnt that God knows what is necessary for us before we ask it
of Him. Must the truth of this declaration be given up, or shall we think that it should be
erased from the gospel because of such people? Nay, since it is manifest that God has prepared
some things to be given even to those who do not pray for them, such as the beginning of
faith, and other things not to be given except to those who pray for them, such as perseverance
even unto the end, certainly he who thinks that he has this latter from himself does not pray
to have it. Therefore we must take care lest, while we are afraid of exhortation growing

<head>Chapter 40.—When the Truth Must Be Spoken, When Kept Back.</head>
<p>Therefore let the truth be spoken, especially when any question impels us to declare it;
and let them receive it who are able, lest, perchance, while we are silent on account of those
who cannot receive it, they be not only defrauded of the truth but be taken captive by
falsehood, who are able to receive the truth whereby falsehood may be avoided. For it is
easy, nay, and it is useful, that some truth should be kept back because of those who are incapable
of apprehending it. For whence is that word of our Lord: “I have yet many things
to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now”?3659 And that of the apostle: “I could not
speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal: as if unto babes in Christ I have given
you to drink milk, and not meat, for hitherto ye were not able, neither yet indeed now are
ye able”?3660 Although, in a certain manner of speaking, it might happen that what is said
should be both milk to infants and meat for grown-up persons. As “in the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,”3661 what Christian can
keep it back? Who can receive it? Or what in sound doctrine can be found more comprehensive?
And yet this is not kept back either from infants or from grown-up people, nor is
it hidden from infants by those who are mature. But the reason of keeping back the truth
is one, the necessity of speaking the truth is another. It would be a tedious business to inquire
into or to put down all the reasons for keeping back the truth; of which, nevertheless, there
is this one,—lest we should make those who do not understand worse, while wishing to
make those who do understand more learned; although these latter do not become more
learned when we withhold any such thing on the one hand, but also do not become worse.
When, however, a truth is of such a nature that he who cannot receive it is made worse by
our speaking it, and he who can receive it is made worse by our silence concerning it, what
do we think is to be done? Must we not speak the truth, that he who can receive it may receive
it, rather than keep silence, so that not only neither may receive it, but that even he who is
more intelligent should himself be made worse? For if he should hear and receive it, by his
means also many might learn. For in proportion as he is more capable of learning, he is the
more fitted for teaching others. The enemy of grace presses on and urges in all ways to make
us believe that grace is given according to our deservings, and thus grace is no more grace;
and are we unwilling to say what we can say by the testimony of Scripture? Do we fear, forsooth,
to offend by our speaking him who is not able to receive the truth? and are we not
afraid lest by our silence he who can receive the truth may be involved in falsehood?</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—Predestination Defined as Only God’s Disposing of Events in His
Foreknowledge.</head>
<p>For either predestination must be preached, in the way and degree in which the Holy
Scripture plainly declares it, so that in the predestinated the gifts and calling of God may be
without repentance; or it must be avowed that God’s grace is given according to our merits,—
which is the opinion of the Pelagians; although that opinion of theirs, as I have often
said already, may be read in the Proceedings of the Eastern bishops to have been condemned
by the lips of Pelagius himself.3662 Further, those on whose account I am discoursing are
only removed from the heretical perversity of the Pelagians, inasmuch as, although they will
not confess that they who by God’s grace are made obedient and so abide, are predestinated,
they still confess, nevertheless, that this grace precedes their will to whom it is given; in such
a way certainly as that grace may not be thought to be given freely, as the truth declares, but
rather according to the merits of a preceding will, as the Pelagian error says, in contradiction
to the truth. Therefore, also, grace precedes faith; otherwise, if faith precedes grace, beyond
a doubt will also precedes it, because there cannot be faith without will. But if grace precedes
faith because it precedes will, certainly it precedes all obedience; it also precedes love, by
which alone God is truly and pleasantly obeyed. And all these things grace works in him to
whom it is given, and in whom it precedes all these things. <del>XVII.</del> Among these benefits
there remains perseverance unto the end, which is daily asked for in vain from the Lord, if
the Lord by His grace does not effect it in him whose prayers He hears. See now how foreign
it is from the truth to deny that perseverance even to the end of this life is the gift of God;
since He Himself puts an end to this life when He wills, and if He puts an end before a fall
that is threatening, He makes the man to persevere even unto the end. But more marvellous
and more manifest to believers is the largess of God’s goodness, that this grace is given even
to infants, although there is no obedience at that age to which it may be given. To whomsoever,
therefore, God gives His gifts, beyond a doubt He has foreknown that He will bestow
them on them, and in His foreknowledge He has prepared them for them. Therefore, those
whom He predestinated, them He also called with that calling which I am not reluctant often
to make mention of, of which it is said, “The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.”
3663 For the ordering of His future works in His foreknowledge, which cannot be deceived
and changed, is absolute, and is nothing but, predestination. But, as he whom God
has foreknown to be chaste, although he may regard it as uncertain, so acts as to be chaste,
so he whom He has predestinated to be chaste, although he may regard that as uncertain,
does not, therefore, fail to act so as to be chaste because he hears that he is to be what he
will be by the gift of God. Nay, rather, his love rejoices, and he is not puffed up as if he had

predestination, but he is even assisted to it, so that although he glories he may glory in the
Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter 42.—The Adversaries Cannot Deny Predestination to Those Gifts of Grace
Which They Themselves Acknowledge, and Their Exhortations are Not Hindered
by This Predestination Nevertheless.</head>
<p>And what I said of chastity, can be said also of faith, of piety, of love, of perseverance,
and, not to enumerate single virtues, it may be said with the utmost truthfulness of all the
obedience with which God is obeyed. But those who place only the beginning of faith and
perseverance to the end in such wise in our power as not to regard them as God’s gifts, nor
to think that God works on our thoughts and wills so as that we may have and retain them,
grant, nevertheless, that He gives other things,—since they are obtained from Him by the
faith of the believer. Why are they not afraid that exhortation to these other things, and the
preaching of these other things, should be hindered by the definition of predestination? Or,
perchance, do they say that such things are not predestinated? Then they are not given by
God, or He has not known that He would give them. Because, if they are both given, and
He foreknew that He would give them, certainly He predestinated them. As, therefore, they
themselves also exhort to chastity, charity, piety, and other things which they confess to be
God’s gifts, and cannot deny that they are also foreknown by Him, and therefore predestinated;
nor do they say that their exhortations are hindered by the preaching of God’s predestination,
that is, by the preaching of God’s foreknowledge of those future gifts of His: so
they may see that neither are their exhortations to faith or to perseverance hindered, even
although those very things may be said, as is the truth, to be gifts of God, and that those
things are foreknown, that is, predestinated to be given; but let them rather see that by this
preaching of predestination only that most pernicious error is hindered and overthrown,
whereby it is said that the grace of God is given according to our deservings, so that he who
glories may glory not in the Lord, but in himself.</p>

<pb n="1461"/>
<head>Chapter 43.—Further Development of the Foregoing Argument.</head>
<p>And in order that I may more openly unfold this for the sake of those who are somewhat
slow of apprehension, let those who are endowed with an intelligence that flies in advance
bear with my delay. The Apostle James says, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.”3664 It is
written also in the Proverbs of Solomon, “Because theLord giveth wisdom.”3665 And of
continency it is read in the book of Wisdom, whose authority has been used by great and
learned men who have commented upon the divine utterances long before us; there, therefore,
it is read, “When I knew that no one can be continent unless God gives it, and that this was
of wisdom, to know whose gift this was.”3666 Therefore these are God’s gifts,—that is, to
say nothing of others, wisdom and continency. Let those also acquiesce: for they are not
Pelagians, to contend against such a manifest truth as this with hard and heretical perversity.
“But,” say they, “that these things are given to us of God is obtained by faith, which has its
beginning from us;” and both to begin to have this faith, and to abide in it even to the end,
they contend is our own doing, as if we received it not from the Lord. This, beyond a doubt,
is in contradiction to the apostle when he says, “For what hast thou that thou hast not received?”
3667 It is in contradiction also to the saying of the martyr Cyprian, “That we must
boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.”3668 When we have said this, and many other
things which it is wearisome to repeat, and have shown that both the commencement of
faith and perseverance to the end are gifts of God; and that it is impossible that God should
not foreknow any of His future gifts, as well what should be given as to whom they should
be given; and that thus those whom He delivers and crowns are predestinated by Him; they
think it well to reply, “that the assertion of predestination is opposed to the advantage of
preaching, for the reason that when this is heard no one can be stirred up by the incentives
of rebuke.” When they say this, “they are unwilling that it should be declared to men, that
coming to the faith and abiding in the faith are God’s gifts, lest despair rather than encouragement
should appear to be suggested, inasmuch as they who hear think that it is uncertain
to human ignorance on whom God bestows, or on whom He does not bestow, these gifts.”
Why, then, do they themselves also preach with us that wisdom and continency are God’s
gifts? But if, when these things are declared to be God’s gifts, there is no hindrance of the
exhortation with which we exhort men to be wise and continent; what is after all the reason
for their thinking that the exhortation is hindered wherewith we exhort men to come to the

<pb n="1463"/>
<head>Chapter 44.—Exhortation to Wisdom, Though Wisdom is God’s Gift.</head>
<p>Now, to say nothing more of continency, and to argue in this place of wisdom alone,
certainly the Apostle James above mentioned says, “But the wisdom that is from above is
first pure, then peaceable, modest, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, inestimable,
without simulation.”3669 Do you not see, I beseech you, how this wisdom descends
from the Father of Lights, laden with many and great benefits? Because, as the same apostle
says, “Every excellent gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the
Father of Lights.”3670 Why, then—to set aside other matters—do we rebuke the impure and
contentious, to whom we nevertheless preach that the gift of God is wisdom, pure and
peaceable; and are not afraid that they should be influenced, by the uncertainty of the divine
will, to find in this preaching more of despair than of exhortation; and that they should not
be stirred up by the incentives of rebuke rather against us than against themselves, because
we rebuke them for not having those things which we ourselves say are not produced by
human will, but are given by the divine liberality? Finally, why did the preaching of this
grace not deter the Apostle James from rebuking restless souls, and saying, “If ye have bitter
envying, and contentions are in your hearts, glory not, and be not liars against the truth.
This is not the wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, animal, devilish; for
where envying and contention are, there are inconstancy and every evil work”?3671 As,
therefore, the restless are to be rebuked, both by the testimony of the divine declarations,
and by those very impulses of ours which they have in common with ourselves; and is it no
argument against this rebuke that we declare the peaceful wisdom, whereby the contentions
are corrected and healed, to be the gift of God; unbelievers are in such wise to be rebuked,
as those who do not abide in the faith, without any hindrance to that rebuke from the
preaching of God’s grace, although that preaching commends that very grace and the continuance
in it as the gifts of God. Because, although wisdom is obtained from faith, even as
James himself, when he had said, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth
to all liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given,”3672 immediately added, “But let
him ask in faith, nothing wavering:” it is not, nevertheless, because faith is given before it
is asked for by him to whom it is given, that it must therefore be said not to be the gift of
God, but to be of ourselves, because it is given to us without our asking for it! For the apostle
very plainly says, “Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith from God the Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ.”3673 From whom, therefore, are peace and love, from Him also is

<p>Nor do those on whose account I am saying these things, who cry out that exhortation
is checked by the preaching of predestination and grace, exhort to those gifts alone which
they contend are not given by God, but are from ourselves, such as are the beginning of
faith, and perseverance in it even to the end. This certainly they ought to do, in such a way
as only to exhort unbelievers to believe, and believers to continue to believe. But those things
which with us they do not deny to be God’s gifts, so as that with us they demolish the error
of the Pelagians, such as modesty, continence, patience, and other virtues that pertain to a
holy life, and are obtained by faith from the Lord, they ought to show as needing to be prayed
for, and to pray for only, either for themselves or others; but they ought not to exhort any
one to strive after them and retain them. But when they exhort to these things, according
to their ability, and confess that men ought to be exhorted,—certainly they show plainly
enough that exhortations are not hindered by that preaching, whether they are exhortations
to faith or to perseverance to the end, because we also preach that such things are God’s
gifts, and are not given by any man to himself, but are given by God.</p>

<p>But it is said, “It is by his own fault that any one deserts the faith, when he yields and
consents to the temptation which is the cause of his desertion of the faith.” Who denies it?
But because of this, perseverance in the faith is not to be said not to be a gift of God. For it
is this that a man daily asks for when he says, “Lead us not into temptation;”3674 and if he
is heard, it is this that he receives. And thus as he daily asks for perseverance, he assuredly
places the hope of his perseverance not in himself, but in God. I, however, am loth to exaggerate
the case with my words, but I rather leave it to them to consider, and see what it is
of which they have persuaded themselves—to wit, “that by the preaching of predestination,
more of despair than of exhortation is impressed upon the hearers.” For this is to say that
a man then despairs of his salvation when he has learned to place his hope not in himself,
but in God, although the prophet cries, “Cursed is he who has his hope in man.”3675</p>

<head>Chapter 47.—Predestination is Sometimes Signified Under the Name of Foreknowledge.</head>
<p>These gifts, therefore, of God, which are given to the elect who are called according to
God’s purpose, among which gifts is both the beginning of belief and perseverance in the
faith to the termination of this life, as I have proved by such a concurrent testimony of
reasons and authorities,—these gifts of God, I say, if there is no such predestination as I am
maintaining, are not foreknown by God. But they are foreknown. This, therefore, is the
predestination which I maintain. <del>XVIII.</del> Consequently sometimes the same predestination
is signified also under the name of foreknowledge; as says the apostle, “God has not rejected
His people whom He foreknew.”3676 Here, when he says, “He foreknew,” the sense is not
rightly understood except as “He predestinated,” as is shown by the context of the passage
itself. For he was speaking of the remnant of the Jews which were saved, while the rest perished.
For above he had said that the prophet had declared to Israel, “All day long I have
stretched forth my hands to an unbelieving and a gainsaying people.”3677 And as if it were
answered, What, then, has become of the promises of God to Israel? he added in continuation,
“I say, then, has God cast away His people? God forbid! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed
of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.” Then he added the words which I am now treating:
“God hath not cast away His people whom He foreknew.” And in order to show that the
remnant had been left by God’s grace, not by any merits of their works, he went on to add,
“Know ye not what the Scripture saith in Elias, in what way he maketh intercession with
God against Israel?”3678 and the rest. “But what,” says he, “saith the answer of God unto
him? ‘I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee before
Baal.’”3679 For He says not, “There are left to me,” or “They have reserved themselves to
me,” but, “I have reserved to myself.” “Even so, then, at this present time also there is made
a remnant by the election of grace. And if of grace, then it is no more by works; otherwise
grace is no more grace.” And connecting this with what I have above quoted, “What
then?”3680 and in answer to this inquiry, he says, “Israel hath not obtained that which he
was seeking for, but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.” Therefore, in
the election, and in this remnant which were made so by the election of grace, he wished to
be understood the people which God did not reject, because He foreknew them. This is that
election by which He elected those, whom He willed, in Christ before the foundation of the
world, that they should be holy and without spot in His sight, in love, predestinating them

unto the adoption of sons. No one, therefore, who understands these things is permitted to
doubt that, when the apostle says, “God hath not cast away His people whom He foreknew,”
He intended to signify predestination. For He foreknew the remnant which He should make
so according to the election of grace. That is, therefore, He predestinated them; for without
doubt He foreknew if He predestinated; but to have predestinated is to have foreknown that
which He should do.</p>

<p>What, then, hinders us, when we read of God’s foreknowledge in some commentators
on God’s word, and they are treating of the calling of the elect, from understanding the same
predestination? For they would perchance have rather used in this matter this word which,
moreover, is better understood, and which is not inconsistent with, nay, is in accordance
with, the truth which is declared concerning the predestination of grace. This I know, that
no one has been able to dispute, except erroneously, against that predestination which I am
maintaining in accordance with the Holy Scriptures. Yet I think that they who ask for the
opinions of commentators on this matter ought to be satisfied with men so holy and so
laudably celebrated everywhere in the faith and Christian doctrine as Cyprian and Ambrose,
of whom I have given such clear testimonies; and that for both doctrines—that is, that they
should both believe absolutely and preach everywhere that the grace of God is gratuitous,
as we must believe and declare it to be; and that they should not think that preaching opposed
to the preaching whereby we exhort the indolent or rebuke the evil; because these celebrated
men also, although they were preaching God’s grace in such a manner as that one of them
said, “That we must boast in nothing, because nothing is our own;”3681 and the other, “Our
heart and our thoughts are not in our own power;”3682 yet ceased not to exhort and rebuke,
in order that the divine commands might be obeyed. Neither were they afraid of its being
said to them, “Why do you exhort us, and why do you rebuke us, if no good thing that we
have is from us, and if our hearts are not in our own power?” These holy men could by no
means fear that such things should be said to them, since they were of the mind to understand
that it is given to very few to receive the teaching of salvation through God Himself, or
through the angels of heaven, without any human preaching to them; but that it is given to
many to believe in God through human agency. Yet, in whatever manner the word of God
is spoken to man, beyond a doubt for man to hear it in such a way as to obey it, is God’s
gift.</p>

<head>Chapter 49.—Further References to Cyprian and Ambrose.</head>
<p>Wherefore, the above-mentioned most excellent commentators on the divine declarations
both preached the true grace of God as it ought to be preached,—that is, as a grace preceded
by no human deservings,—and urgently exhorted to the doing of the divine commandments,
that they who might have the gift of obedience should hear what commands they ought to
obey. For if any merits of ours precede grace, certainly it is the merit of some deed, or word,
or thought, wherein also is understood a good will itself. But he very briefly summed up the
kinds of all deservings who said, “We must glory in nothing, because nothing is our own.”
And he who says, “Our heart and our thoughts are not in our own power,” did not pass over
acts and words also, for there is no act or word of man which does not proceed from the
heart and the thought. But what more could that most glorious martyr and most luminous
doctor Cyprian say concerning this matter, than when he impressed upon us that it behoves
us to pray, in the Lord’s Prayer, even for the adversaries of the Christian faith, showing what
he thought of the beginning of the faith, that it also is God’s gift, and pointing out that the
Church of Christ prays daily for perseverance unto the end, because none but God gives
that perseverance to those who have persevered? Moreover, the blessed Ambrose, when he
was expounding the passage where the Evangelist Luke says, “It seemed good to me also,”
3683 says, “What he declares to have seemed good to himself cannot have seemed good to
him alone. For not alone by human will did it seem good, but as it pleased Him who speaks
in me, Christ, who effects that that which is good may also seem good to us: for whom He
has mercy on He also calls. And therefore he who follows Christ may answer, when he is
asked why he wished to become a Christian, ‘It seemed good to me also.’ And when he says
this, he does not deny that it seemed good to God; for the will of men is prepared by God.
For it is God’s grace that God should be honoured by the saint.”3684 Moreover, in the same
work,—that is, in the exposition of the same Gospel, when he had come to that place where
the Samaritans would not receive the Lord when His face was as going to Jerusalem,—he
says, “Learn at the same time that He would not be received by those who were not converted
in simpleness of mind. For if He had been willing, He would have made them devout who
were undevout. And why they would not receive Him, the evangelist himself mentioned,
saying, ‘Because His face was as of one going towards Jerusalem.’3685 But the disciples
earnestly desired to be received into Samaria. But God calls those whom He makes worthy,
and makes religious whom He will.”3686 What more evident, what more manifest do we
ask from commentators on God’s word, if we are pleased to hear from them what is clear

in the Scriptures? But to these two, who ought to be enough, let us add also a third, the holy
Gregory, who testifies that it is the gift of God both to believe in God and to confess what

you may confess what you believe. “For He will give, I am certain. He who gave what is first,
will give also what is second.”3687 He who gave belief, will also give confession.</p>

<head>Chapter 50.—Obedience Not Discouraged by Preaching God’s Gifts.</head>
<p>Such doctors, and so great as these, when they say that there is nothing of which we
may boast as if of our own which God has not given us, and that our very heart and our
thoughts are not in our own power; and when they give the whole to God, and confess that
from Him we receive that we are converted to Him in such wise as to continue,—that that
which is good appears also to us to be good, and we wish for it,—that we honour God and
receive Christ,—that from undevout people we are made devout and religious,—that we
believe in the Trinity itself, and also confess with our voice what we believe:—certainly attribute
all these things to God’s grace, acknowledge them as God’s gifts, and testify that they
come to us from Him, and are not from ourselves. But will any one say that they in such
wise confessed that grace of God as to venture to deny His foreknowledge, which not only
learned but unlearned men also confess? Again, if they had so known that God gives these
things that they were not ignorant that He foreknew that He would give them, and could
not have been ignorant to whom He would give them: beyond a doubt they had known the
predestination which, as preached by the apostles, we laboriously and diligently maintain
against the modern heretics. Nor would it be with any manner of justice said, nevertheless,
to them because they preach obedience, and fervently exhort, to the extent of the ability of
each one, to its practice, “If you do not wish that the obedience to which you are stirring us
up should grow cold in our heart, forbear to preach to us that grace of God by which you
confess that God gives what you are exhorting us to do.”</p>

<head>Chapter 51 <del>XX.</del>—Predestination Must Be Preached.</head>
<p>Wherefore, if both the apostles and the teachers of the Church who succeeded them
and imitated them did both these things,—that is, both truly preached the grace of God
which is not given according to our merits, and inculcated by wholesome precepts a pious
obedience,—what is it which these people of our time think themselves rightly bound by
the invincible force of truth to say, “Even if what is said of the predestination of God’s benefits
be true, yet it must not be preached to the people”?3688 It must absolutely be preached, so
that he who has ears to hear, may hear. And who has them if he has not received them from
Him who says, “I will give them a heart to know me, and ears to hear?”3689 Assuredly, he
who has not received may reject; while, yet, he who receives may take and drink, may drink
and live. For as piety must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, God may be
rightly worshipped; modesty must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, no illicit
act may be perpetrated by his fleshly nature; charity must be preached, that, by him who
has ears to hear, God and his neighbours may be loved;—so also must be preached such a
predestination of God’s benefits that he who has ears to hear may glory, not in himself, but
in the Lord.</p>

the catholic faith has been defended for so many years, with no less advantage, without this

Pelagians had begun to appear; and that they do not see in how many passages of those
treatises I was unawares cutting down a future Pelagian heresy, by preaching the grace by
which God delivers us from evil errors and from our habits, without any preceding merits
of ours,—doing this according to His gratuitous mercy. And this I began more fully to apprehend
in that disputation which I wrote to Simplicianus, the bishop of the Church of
Milan, of blessed memory, in the beginning of my episcopate, when, moreover, I both perceived
and asserted that the beginning of faith is God’s gift.</p>

<p>And which of my smaller works has been able to be more generally and more agreeably
known than the books of my Confessions? And although I published them before the Pelagian
heresy had come into existence, certainly in them I said to my God, and said it frequently,
“Give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou willest.”3691 Which
words of mine, Pelagius at Rome, when they were mentioned in his presence by a certain
brother and fellow bishop of mine, could not bear; and contradicting somewhat too excitedly,
nearly came to a quarrel with him who had mentioned them. But what, indeed, does God
primarily and chiefly command, but that we believe on Him? And this, therefore, He Himself
gives, if it is well said to Him, “Give what Thou commandest.” And, moreover, in those
same books, in respect of what I have related concerning my conversion, when God converted
me to that faith which, with a most miserable and raging talkativeness, I was destroying, do
you not remember that it was so narrated how I showed that I was granted to the faithful
and daily tears of my mother, that I should not perish?3692 Where certainly I declared that
God by His grace converted to the true faith the wills of men, which were not only averse
to it, but even adverse to it. Further, in what manner I besought God concerning my growth
in perseverance, you know, and you are able to review if you wish it. Therefore, that all the
gifts of God which in that work I either asked for or praised, were foreknown by God that
He would give, and that He could never be ignorant of the persons to whom He would give
them, who can dare, I will not say to deny, but even to doubt? This is the manifest and assured
predestination of the saints, which subsequently necessity compelled me more carefully and
laboriously to defend when I was already disputing against the Pelagians. For I learnt that
each special heresy introduced its own peculiar questions into the Church—against which
the sacred Scripture might be more carefully defended than if no such necessity compelled
their defence. And what compelled those passages of Scripture in which predestination is
commended to be defended more abundantly and clearly by that labour of mine, than the
fact that the Pelagians say that God’s grace is given according to our merits; for what else is
this than an absolute denial of grace?</p>

<p>Therefore that this opinion, which is unpleasing to God, and hostile to those gratuitous
benefits of God whereby we are delivered, may be destroyed, I maintain that both the beginning
of faith and the perseverance therein, even to the end, are, according to the Scriptures—
of which I have already quoted many—God’s gifts. Because if we say that the beginning
of faith is of ourselves, so that by it we deserve to receive other gifts of God, the Pelagians
conclude that God’s grace is given according to our merits. And this the catholic faith held
in such dread, that Pelagius himself, in fear of condemnation, condemned it. And, moreover,
if we say that our perseverance is of ourselves, not of God, they answer that we have the
beginning of our faith of ourselves in such wise as the end, thus arguing that we have that
beginning of ourselves much more, if of ourselves we have the continuance unto the end,
since to perfect is much greater than to begin; and thus repeatedly they conclude that the
grace of God is given according to our merits. But if both are God’s gifts, and God foreknew
that He would give these His gifts (and who can deny this?), predestination must be
preached,—that God’s true grace, that is, the grace which is not given according to our
merits, may be maintained with insuperable defence.</p>

<p>And, indeed, in that treatise of which the title is, Of Rebuke and Grace,3693 which could
not suffice for all my lovers, I think that I have so established that it is the gift of God also
to persevere to the end, as I have either never before or almost never so expressly and evidently
maintained this in writing, unless my memory deceives me. But I have now said this
in a way in which no one before me has said it. Certainly the blessed Cyprian, in the Lord’s
Prayer, as I have already shown, so explained our petitions as to say that in its very first petition
we were asking for perseverance, asserting that we pray for it when we say, “Hallowed
be Thy name,”3694 although we have been already hallowed in baptism,—so that we may
persevere in that which we have begun to be. Let those, however, to whom, in their love for
me, I ought not to be ungrateful, who profess that they embrace, over and above that which
comes into the argument, all my views, as you write,—let those, I say, see whether, in the
latter portions of the first book of those two which I wrote in the beginning of my episcopate,
before the appearance of the Pelagian heresy, to Simplicianus, the bishop of Milan,3695 there
remained anything whereby it might be called in question that God’s grace is not given according
to our merits; and whether I have not there sufficiently argued that even the beginning
of faith is God’s gift; and whether from what is there said it does not by consequence
result, although it is not expressed, that even perseverance to the end is not given, except
by Him who has predestinated us to His kingdom and glory. Then, did not I many years
ago publish that letter which I had already written to the holy Paulinus,3696 bishop of Nola,
against the Pelagians, which they have lately begun to contradict? Let them also look into
that letter which I sent to Sixtus, the presbyter of the Roman Church3697 when we contended
in a very sharp conflict against the Pelagians, and they will find it such as is that one to
Paulinus. Whence they may gather that the same sort of things were already said and written
several years ago against the Pelagian heresy, and that it is to be wondered at that these
should now displease them; although I should wish that no one would so embrace all my
views as to follow me, except in those things in which he should see me not to have erred.
For I am now writing treatises in which I have undertaken to retract my smaller works, for
the purpose of demonstrating that even I myself have not in all things followed myself; but
I think that, with God’s mercy, I have written progressively, and not begun from perfection;
since, indeed, I speak more arrogantly than truly, if even now I say that I have at length in
this age of mine arrived at perfection, without any error in what I write. But the difference

<head>Chapter 56.—God Gives Means as Well as End.</head>
<p>Wherefore if I am unwilling to appear ungrateful to men who have loved me, because
some advantage of my labour has attained to them before they loved me, how much rather
am I unwilling to be ungrateful to God, whom we should not love unless He had first loved
us and made us to love Him! since love is of Him,3698 as they have said whom He made not
only His great lovers, but also His great preachers. And what is more ungrateful than to
deny the grace of God itself, by saying that it is given to us according to our merits? And
this the catholic faith shuddered at in the Pelagians, and this it objected to Pelagius himself
as a capital crime; and this Pelagius himself condemned, not indeed from love of God’s
truth, but yet for fear of his own condemnation. But whoever as a faithful catholic is horrified
to say that the grace of God is given according to our merits, let him not withdraw faith itself
from God’s grace, whereby he obtained mercy that he should be faithful; and thus let him
attribute also perseverance to the end to God’s grace, whereby he obtains the mercy which
he daily asks for, not to be led into temptation. But between the beginning of faith and the
perfection of perseverance there are those means whereby we live righteously, which they
themselves are agreed in regarding as given by God to us at the prayer of faith. And all these
things—the beginning of faith, to wit, and His other gifts even to the end—God foreknew
that He would bestow on His called. It is a matter therefore, of too excessive contentiousness
to contradict predestination, or to doubt concerning predestination.</p>

men cannot deny, seems to be refuted if it be said to them, “Whether you run or sleep, you
shall be that which He who cannot be deceived has foreknown you to be.” And it is the part
of a deceitful or an unskilled physician so to compound even a useful medicament, that it
either does no good or does harm. But it must be said, “So run that you may lay hold;3699
and thus by your very running you may know yourselves to be foreknown as those who
should run lawfully:” and in whatever other manner the foreknowledge of God may be so
preached, that the slothfulness of man may be repulsed.</p>

<head>Chapter 58.—The Doctrine to Be Applied with Discrimination.</head>
<p>Now, therefore, the definite determination of God’s will concerning predestination is
of such a kind that some from unbelief receive the will to obey, and are converted to the
faith or persevere in the faith, while others who abide in the delight of damnable sins, even
if they have been predestinated, have not yet arisen, because the aid of pitying grace has not
yet lifted them up. For if any are not yet called whom by His grace He has predestinated to
be elected, they will receive that grace whereby they may will to be elected, and may be so;
and if any obey, but have not been predestinated to His kingdom and glory, they are for a
season, and will not abide in the same obedience to the end. Although, then, these things
are true, yet they must not be so said to the multitude of hearers as that the address may be
applied to themselves also, and those words of those people may be said to them which you
have set down in your letter, and which I have above introduced: “The definite determination
of God’s will concerning predestination is of such a kind that some of you from unbelief
shall receive the will to obey, and come to the faith.” What need is there for saying, “Some
of you”? For if we speak to God’s Church, if we speak to believers, why do we say that “some
of them” had come to the faith, and seem to do a wrong to the rest, when we may more fittingly
say the definite determination of the will of God concerning predestination is of such
a kind that from unbelief you shall receive the will to obey, and come to the faith, and shall
receive perseverance, and abide to the end?</p>

thus: “And if any of you are not yet called, let us pray for them that they may be called. For
perchance they are so predestinated as to be granted to our prayers, and to receive that grace
whereby they may will, and be made elected”? For God, who fulfilled all that He predestinated,
has willed us also to pray for the enemies of the faith, that we might hence understand that
He Himself also gives to the unbelievers the gift of faith, and makes willing men out of those
that were unwilling.</p>

<p>But now I marvel if any weak brother among the Christian congregation can hear in
any way with patience what is connected with these words, when it is said to them, “And if
any of you obey, if you are predestinated to be rejected, the power of obeying will be withdrawn
from you, that you may cease to obey.” For what does saying this seem, except to
curse, or in a certain way to predict evils? But if, however, it is desirable or necessary to say
anything concerning those who do not persevere, why is it not rather at least said in such a
way as was a little while ago said by me,—first of all, so that this should be said, not of them
who hear in the congregation, but about others to them; that is, that it should not be said,
“If any of you obey, if you are predestinated to be rejected,” but, “If any obey,” and the rest,
using the third person of the verb, not the second? For it is not to be said to be desirable,
but abominable, and it is excessively harsh and hateful to fly as it were into the face of an
audience with abuse, when he who speaks to them says, “And if there are any of you who
obey, and are predestinated to be rejected, the power of obedience shall be withdrawn from
you, that you may cease to obey.” For what is wanting to the doctrine if it is thus expressed:
“But if any obey, and are not predestinated to His kingdom and glory, they are only for a
season, and shall not continue in that obedience unto the end”? Is not the same thing said
both more truly and more fittingly, so that we may seem not as it were to be desiring so
much for them, as to relate of others the evil which they hate, and think does not belong to
them, by hoping and praying for better things? But in that manner in which they think that
it must be said, the same judgment may be pronounced almost in the same words also of
God’s foreknowledge, which certainly they cannot deny, so as to say, “And if any of you
obey, if you are foreknown to be rejected you shall cease to obey.” Doubtless this is very
true, assuredly it is; but it is very monstrous, very inconsiderate, and very unsuitable, not
by its false declaration, but by its declaration not wholesomely applied to the health of human
infirmity.</p>

<p>But I do not think that manner which I have said should be adopted in the preaching
of predestination ought to be sufficient for him who speaks to the congregation, except he
adds this, or something of this kind, saying, “You, therefore, ought also to hope for that
perseverance in obedience from the Father of Lights, from whom cometh down every excellent
gift and every perfect gift,3702 and to ask for it in your daily prayers; and in doing this
ought to trust that you are not aliens from the predestination of His people, because it is He
Himself who bestows even the power of doing this. And far be it from you to despair of
yourselves, because you are bidden to have your hope in Him, not in yourselves. For cursed
is every one who has hope in man;3703 and it is good rather to trust in the Lord than to trust
in man, because blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.3704 Holding this hope, serve
the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.3705 Because no one can be certain
of the life eternal which God who does not lie has promised to the children of promise before
the times of eternity,—no one, unless that life of his, which is a state of trial upon the earth,
is completed.3706 But He will make us to persevere in Himself unto the end of that life, since
we daily say to Him, ‘Lead us not into temptation.’”3707 When these things and things of
this kind are said, whether to few Christians or to the multitude of the Church, why do we
fear to preach the predestination of the saints and the true grace of God,—that is, the grace
which is not given according to our merits,—as the Holy Scripture declares it? Or, indeed,
must it be feared that a man should then despair of himself when his hope is shown to be
placed in God, and should not rather despair of himself if he should, in his excess of pride
and unhappiness, place it in himself?</p>

<p>And I wish that those who are slow and weak of heart, who cannot, or cannot as yet,
understand the Scriptures or the explanations of them, would so hear or not hear our arguments
in this question as to consider more carefully their prayers, which the Church has
always used and will use, even from its beginnings until this age shall be completed. For of
this matter, which I am now compelled not only to mention, but even to protect and defend
against these new heretics, the Church has never been silent in its prayers, although in its
discourses it has not thought that it need be put forth, as there was no adversary compelling
it. For when was not prayer made in the Church for unbelievers and its opponents that they
should believe? When has any believer had a friend, a neighbour, a wife, who did not believe,
and has not asked on their behalf from the Lord for a mind obedient to the Christian faith?
And who has there ever been who has not prayed for himself that he might abide in the
Lord? And who has dared, not only with his voice, but even in thought, to blame the priest
who invokes the Lord on behalf of believers, if at any time he has said, “Give to them, O
Lord, perseverance in Thee to the end!” and has not rather responded, over such a benediction
of his, as well with confessing lips as believing heart, “Amen”? Since in the Lord’s Prayer
itself the believers do not pray for anything else, especially when they say that petition, “Lead
us not into temptation,” save that they may persevere in holy obedience. As, therefore, the
Church has both been born and grows and has grown in these prayers, so it has been born
and grows and has grown in this faith, by which faith it is believed that God’s grace is not
given according to the merits of the receivers. For, certainly, the Church would not pray
that faith should be given to unbelievers, unless it believed that God converts to Himself
both the averse and adverse wills of men. Nor would the Church pray that it might persevere
in the faith of Christ, not deceived nor overcome by the temptations of the world, unless it
believed that the Lord has our heart in His power, in such wise as that the good which we
do not hold save by our own will, we nevertheless do not hold except He worketh in us to
will also. For if the Church indeed asks these things from Him, but thinks that the same
things are given to itself by itself, it makes use of prayers which are not true, but perfunctory,—
which be far from us! For who truly groans, desiring to receive what he prays for
from the Lord, if he thinks that he receives it from himself, and not from the Lord?</p>

<head>Chapter 64.—In What Sense the Holy Spirit Solicits for Us, Crying, Abba, Father.</head>
<p>And this especially since “we know not what to pray for as we ought,” says the apostle,
“but the Spirit Himself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered;
and He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because He maketh
intercession for the saints according to God.”3708 What is “the Spirit Himself maketh intercession,”
but, “causes to make intercession,” “with groanings that cannot be uttered,” but
“truthful,” since the Spirit is truth? For He it is of whom the apostle says in another place,
“God hath sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, “crying, Abba, Father!”3709 And here
what is the meaning of “crying,” but “making to cry,” by that figure of speech whereby we
call a day that makes people glad, a glad day? And this he makes plain elsewhere when he
says, “For you have not received the Spirit of bondage again in fear, but you have received
the Spirit of the adoption of sons, in whom we cry, Abba, Father.”3710 He there said, “crying,”
but here, “in whom we cry;” opening up, that is to say, the meaning with which he said
“crying,”—that is, as I have already explained, “causing to cry,” when we understand that
this is also itself the gift of God, that with a true heart and spiritually we cry to God. Let
them, therefore, observe how they are mistaken who think that our seeking, asking, knocking
is of ourselves, and is not given to us; and say that this is the case because grace is preceded
by our merits; that it follows them when we ask and receive, and seek and find, and it is
opened to us when we knock. And they will not understand that this is also of the divine
gift, that we pray; that is, that we ask, seek, and knock. For we have received the spirit of
adoption of sons, in which we cry, Abba, Father. And this the blessed Ambrose also said.3711
For he says, “To pray to God also is the work of spiritual grace, as it is written, No one says,
Jesus is the Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.”</p>

<head>Chapter 65.—The Church’s Prayers Imply the Church’s Faith.</head>
<p>These things, therefore, which the Church asks from the Lord, and always has asked
from the time she began to exist, God so foreknew that He would give to His called, that He
has already given them in predestination itself; as the apostle declares without any ambiguity.
For, writing to Timothy, he says, “Labour along with the gospel according to the power of
God, who saves us, and calls us with His holy calling, not according to our works, but according
to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times
of eternity, but is now made manifest by the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ.”3712 Let
him, therefore, say that the Church at any time has not had in its belief the truth of this
predestination and grace, which is now maintained with a more careful heed against the
late heretics; let him say this who dares to say that at any time it has not prayed, or not
truthfully prayed, as well that unbelievers might believe, as that believers might persevere.
And if the Church has always prayed for these benefits, it has always believed them to be
certainly God’s gifts; nor was it ever right for it to deny that they were foreknown by Him.
And thus Christ’s Church has never failed to hold the faith of this predestination, which is
now being defended with new solicitude against these modern heretics.</p>

<head>Chapter 66 <del>XXIV.</del>—Recapitulation and Exhortation.</head>
<p>But what more shall I say? I think that I have taught sufficiently, or rather more than
sufficiently, that both the beginning of faith in the Lord, and continuance in the Lord unto
the end, are God’s gifts. And other good things which pertain to a good life, whereby God
is rightly worshipped, even they themselves on whose behalf I am writing this treatise concede
to be God’s gifts. Further, they cannot deny that God has foreknown all His gifts, and the
people on whom He was going to bestow them. As, therefore, other things must be preached
so that he who preaches them may be heard with obedience, so predestination must be
preached so that he who hears these things with obedience may glory not in man, and
therefore not in himself, but in the Lord; for this also is God’s precept, and to hear this
precept with obedience—to wit, that he who glories should glory in the Lord3713—in like
manner as the rest, is God’s gift. And he who has not this gift,—I shrink not from saying
it,—whatever others he has, has them in vain. That the Pelagians may have this we pray,
and that our own brethren may have it more abundantly. Let us not, therefore, be prompt
in arguments and indolent in prayers. Let us pray, dearly beloved, let us pray that the God
of grace may give even to our enemies, and especially to our brethren and lovers, to understand
and confess that after that great and unspeakable ruin wherein we have all fallen in
one, no one is delivered save by God’s grace, and that grace is not repaid according to the
merits of the receivers as if it were due, but is given freely as true grace, with no merits preceding.</p>

<head>Chapter 67.—The Most Eminent Instance of Predestination is Christ Jesus.</head>
<p>But there is no more illustrious instance of predestination than Jesus Himself, concerning
which also I have already argued in the former treatise;3714 and in the end of this I have
chosen to insist upon it. There is no more eminent instance, I say, of predestination than
the Mediator Himself. If any believer wishes thoroughly to understand this doctrine, let him
consider Him, and in Him he will find himself also. The believer, I say; who in Him believes
and confesses the true human nature that is our own, however singularly elevated by assumption
by God the Word into the only Son of God, so that He who assumed, and what He assumed,
should be one person in Trinity. For it was not a Quaternity that resulted from the
assumption of man, but it remained a Trinity, inasmuch as that assumption ineffably made
the truth of one person in God and man. Because we say that Christ was not only God, as
the Manichean heretics contend; nor only man, as the Photinian heretics assert; nor in such
wise man as to have less of anything which of a certainty pertains to human
nature,—whether a soul, or in the soul itself a rational mind, or flesh not taken of the woman,
but made from the Word converted and changed into flesh,—all which three false and empty
notions have made the three various and diverse parties of the Apollinarian heretics; but
we say that Christ was true God, born of God the Father without any beginning of time;
and that He was also true or very man, born of human mother in the certain fulness of time;
and that His humanity, whereby He is less than the Father, does not diminish aught from
His divinity, whereby He is equal to the Father. For both of them are One Christ—who,
moreover, most truly said in respect of the God, “I and the Father are one;”3715 and most
truly said in respect of the man, “My Father is greater than I.”3716 He, therefore, who made
of the seed of David this righteous man, who never should be unrighteous, without any
merit of His preceding will, is the same who also makes righteous men of unrighteous,
without any merit of their will preceding; that He might be the head, and they His members.
He, therefore, who made that man with no precedent merits of His, neither to deduce from
His origin nor to commit by His will any sin which should be remitted to Him, the same
makes believers on Him with no preceding merits of theirs, to whom He forgives all sin. He
who made Him such that He never had or should have an evil will, the same makes in His
members a good will out of an evil one. Therefore He predestinated both Him and us, because
both in Him that He might be our head, and in us that we should be His body, He foreknew
that our merits would not precede, but that His doings should.</p>

<head>Chapter 68.—Conclusion.</head>
<p>Let those who read this, if they understand, give God thanks, and let those who do not
understand, pray that they may have the inward Teacher, from whose presence comes
knowledge and understanding.3717 But let those who think that I am in error, consider again
and again carefully what is here said, lest perchance they themselves may be mistaken. And
when, by means of those who read my writings, I become not only wiser, but even more
perfect, I acknowledge God’s favour to me; and this I especially look for at the hands of the
teachers of the Church, if what I write comes into their hands, and they condescend to acknowledge
it.</p>

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:</head>
<head>NPNF1-04. Augustine: The Writings Against the Manichaeans and
Against the Donatists by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series. The
first series focuses on two classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John
Chrysostom. St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian thinkers
of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two works--the Confessions and the
City of God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine,
such as On the Holy Trinity, Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom
was an eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a more literal
interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity,
particularly what is now called social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged
abuses of authority. This particular volume contains Augustine's writings against the
Donatists and Manichaeism--a form of Gnosticism. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is
comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts
from some of the greatest theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening
texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful
even today!</p>

<head>Works of James Arminius, Vol. 1 by Jacobus Arminius</head>
<p>Jacobus Arminius, a 16th century, Dutch Reformed theologian, had a profound impact on
John and Charles Wesley, and consequently contemporary Protestantism. But Arminius is
perhaps best known as the father of Arminianism--a theological position which challenges
Calvinism. Yet, Arminius' own work is often neglected. This three volume set, the Works
of James Arminius, attempts to fix that neglect. It brings together some of Arminius' most
important works, such as the "Declarations of Sentiment" (volume I), his commentary on
Romans 7 (volume II), his letters (volume III), and "Nine Questions" (volume I). It also
contains a variety of interesting, but lesser-known treatises as well. As a whole, these volumes
will challenge the way you believe; they contain more than simply critiques of Calvinism,
but also subtle and instructive theological ideas. The Works of James Arminius shows that

<pb n="1525"/>
Arminius should be studied along with other great theologians such as St. Augustine, St.
Anselm, St. Aquinas, and Calvin. Ideal for anyone interested in the reformation or
Arminianism, the Works of James Arminius is an instructive and important text.</p>

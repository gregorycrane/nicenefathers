<p>NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian
Doctrine</p>

<pb n="ii"/>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series. The first series focuses on two classical Christian
theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. St.
Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most
popular two works--the Confessions and the City of
God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important
works of St. Augustine, such as On the Holy Trinity,
Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom was an
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St.
John took a more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much
of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly
what is now called social justice. He advocated for
the poor, and challenged abuses of authority. This particular
volume in the series contains Augustine's City of God and
On Christian Doctrine.The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers
is comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of
instructive and illuminating texts from some of the greatest
theologians of the Christian church.These spiritually enlightening
texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years,
and remain instructive and fruitful even today!

Was a Worshipper of the Gods.42</p>

They Were Subjected in Captivity and to Which Their Own Will Gave No
Consent; And Whether This Contaminated Their Souls.44</p>

of Murder.52</p>

Unable to Endure Cæsar’s Victory.54</p>

<p>Recapitulation of the Contents of the First Book. 71</p>

Romans Suffered Before the Religion of Christ Began to Compete with the

Moral Precepts, and that in Celebrating Their Worship All Sorts of Impurities
Were Practiced.73</p>
<p>Of the Obscenities Practiced in Honor of the Mother of the Gods. 75</p>
<p>That the Gods of the Pagans Never Inculcated Holiness of Life. 76</p>
<p>That the Suggestions of Philosophers are Precluded from Having Any Moral
Effect, Because They Have Not the Authority Which Belongs to Divine
Instruction, and Because Man’s Natural Bias to Evil Induces Him Rather to
Follow the Examples of the Gods Than to Obey the Precepts of Men.77</p>
<p>That the Theatrical Exhibitions Publishing the Shameful Actions of the Gods,
Propitiated Rather Than Offended Them.79</p>
<p>That the Poetical License Which the Greeks, in Obedience to Their Gods, 
Allowed, Was Restrained by the Ancient Romans.80</p>
<p>That the Devils, in Suffering Either False or True Crimes to Be Laid to Their 
Charge, Meant to Do Men a Mischief.81</p>
<p>That the Greeks Admitted Players to Offices of State, on the Ground that Men 
Who Pleased the Gods Should Not Be Contemptuously Treated by Their Fellows.82</p>
<p>That the Romans, by Refusing to the Poets the Same License in Respect of Men 
Which They Allowed Them in the Case of the Gods, Showed a More Delicate
Sensitiveness Regarding Themselves than Regarding the Gods.84</p>
<p>That the Romans Should Have Understood that Gods Who Desired to Be 
Worshipped in Licentious Entertainments Were Unworthy of Divine Honor.85</p>
<p>That Plato, Who Excluded Poets from a Well-Ordered City, Was Better Than 
These Gods Who Desire to Be Honoured by Theatrical Plays.87</p>
<p>That It Was Vanity, Not Reason, Which Created Some of the Roman Gods. 89</p>
<p>That If the Gods Had Really Possessed Any Regard for Righteousness, the 
Romans Should Have Received Good Laws from Them, Instead of Having to
Borrow Them from Other Nations.90</p>

<p>How Powerfully the Evil Spirits Incite Men to Wicked Actions, by Giving Them 
the Quasi-Divine Authority of Their Example.107</p>
<p>That the Demons Gave in Secret Certain Obscure Instructions in Morals, While 
in Public Their Own Solemnities Inculcated All Wickedness.109</p>

Being So Common Among Themselves.118</p>

<p>Preface 1157</p>

<p>The Interpretation of Scripture Depends on the Discovery and Enunciation of 
the Meaning, and is to Be Undertaken in Dependence on God’s Aid.1162</p>

<p>Obscure Passages are to Be Interpreted by Those Which are Clearer. 1294</p>

<head>Editor’s Preface</head>
<p>The “City of God” is the masterpiece of the greatest genius among the Latin Fathers,
and the best known and most read of his works, except the “Confessions.” It embodies the
results of thirteen years of intellectual labor and study (from A.D. 413–426). It is a vindication
of Christianity against the attacks of the heathen in view of the sacking of the city of
Rome by the barbarians, at a time when the old Græco-Roman civilization was approaching
its downfall, and a new Christian civilization was beginning to rise on its ruins. It is the
first attempt at a philosophy of history, under the aspect of two rival cities or communities,—
the eternal city of God and the perishing city of the world.</p>
<p>This was the only philosophy of history known throughout Europe during the middle
ages; it was adopted and reproduced in its essential features by Bossuet, Ozanam, Frederick
Schlegel, and other Catholic writers, and has recently been officially endorsed, as it were,
by the scholarly Pope Leo XIII. in his encyclical letter on the Christian Constitution of States
(Immortale Dei, Nov. 1, 1885); for the Pope says that Augustin in his De Civitate Dei, “set
forth so clearly the efficacy of Christian wisdom and the way in which it is bound up with
the well-being of States, that he seems not only to have pleaded the cause of the Christians
of his own time, but to have triumphantly refuted the false charges [against Christianity]
for ever.”1</p>
<p>“The City of God” is also highly appreciated by Protestant writers as Waterland, Milman,
Neander, Bindemann, Pressensé, Flint (The Philosophy of History, 1874, pp. 17 sqq.) and
Fairbairn, (The City of God, London, 2nd ed., 1886, pp. 348 sqq.). Even the skeptical Gibbon,
who had no sympathy whatever with the religion and theology of Augustin, concedes to
this work at least “the merit of a magnificent design, vigorously, and not unskillfully executed.”
(Decline and Fall, Ch. xxviii. note, in Harper’s ed., vol. III., 271.)</p>
<p>It would be unfair to judge “The City of God” by the standard of modern exegetical and
historical scholarship. Augustin’s interpretations of Scripture, although usually ingenious
and often profound, are as often fanciful, and lack the sure foundation of a knowledge of
the original languages; for he knew very little Greek and no Hebrew, and had to depend on
<note type="footnote">1 “Augustinus præsertim in ‘Civitate Dei’virtutem Christianæ sapientiæ, qua parte necessitudinem habet cum
republica, tanto in lumine collocavit, ut non tam pro Christianis sui temporis dixisse caussam quam de criminibus
falsis perpetuum triumphum egisse videatur.” I quote from the Paris edition of the Acta Leonis PapæXIII., 1886,

the Latin version; he was even prejudiced at first against Jerome’s revision of the very defective
Itala, fearing, in his solicitude for the weak and timid brethren, that more harm than
good might be the result of this great and necessary improvement. His learning was confined
to biblical and Roman literature and the systems of Greek philosophy. He often wastes arguments
on absurd opinions, and some of his own opinions strike us as childish and obsolete.
He confines the Kingdom of God to the narrow limits of the Jewish theocracy and the visible
Catholic Church. He could, indeed, not deny the truths in Greek philosophy; but he derived
them from the Jewish Scriptures, and adopted the impossible hypothesis of Ambrose that
Plato became acquainted with the prophet Jeremiah in Egypt (comp. De Doctr. Christ. II.
28), though afterwards he corrected it (Retract. II. 4). He does not sufficiently appreciate
the natural virtues, the ways of Divine providence and the working of His Spirit outside of
the chosen race; and under the influence of the ascetic spirit which then prevailed in the
Church, in justifiable opposition to the surrounding moral corruption of heathenism, he
even degrades secular history and secular life, in the state and the family, which are likewise
ordained of God. In some respects he forms the opposite extreme to Origen, the greatest
genius among the Greek fathers. Both assume a universal fall from original holiness. But
Augustin dates it from one act of disobedience,—the historic fall of Adam, in whom the
whole race was germinally included; while Origen goes back to a pre-historic fall of each
individual soul, making each responsible for the abuse of freedom. Augustin proceeds to
a special election of a people of God from the corrupt and condemned mass; he follows their
history in two antagonistic lines, and ends in the dualistic contrast of an eternal heaven for
the elect and an eternal hell for the reprobate, including among the latter even unbaptized
infants (horribile dictu!), who never committed an actual transgression; while Origen leads
all fallen creatures, men and angels, by a slow and gradual process of amendment and correction,
under the ever-widening influence of redeeming mercy, during the lapse of countless
ages, back to God, some outstripping others and tending by a swifter course towards perfection,
until the last enemy is finally reached and death itself is destroyed, that “God may be
all in all.” Within the limits of the Jewish theocracy and Catholic Christianity Augustin
admits the idea of historical development or a gradual progress from a lower to higher grades
of knowledge, yet always in harmony with Catholic truth. He would not allow revolutions
and radical changes or different types of Christianity. “The best thinking” (says Dr. Flint,
in his Philosophy of History in Europe, I. 40), “at once the most judicious and liberal, among
those who are called the Christian fathers, on the subject of the progress of Christianity as
an organization and system, is that of St. Augustin, as elaborated and applied by Vincent
of Lerins in his ‘Commonitorium,’ where we find substantially the same conception of the
development of the Church and Christian doctrine, which, within the present century, De
Maistre has made celebrated in France, Möhler in Germany, and Newman in England. Its

<pb n="5"/>
main defect is that it places in the Church an authority other than, and virtually higher than,
Scripture and reason, to determine what is true and false in the development of doctrine.”</p>
<p>With all its defects the candid reader will be much instructed and edified by “the City
of God,” and find more to admire than to censure in this immortal work of sanctified
genius and learning.</p>
<p>The present translation, the first accurate and readable one in the English language, was
prepared by the accomplished editor of the Works of Aurelius Augustin, published by T.
and T. Clark of Edinburgh.2 I urged Dr. Dods by letter and in person to re-edit it for this
Patristic Series with such changes and additions as he might wish to make, but he declined,
partly from want of leisure, and partly for a reason which I must state in his own language.
“I thought,” he writes in a letter to me of Nov. 23, 1886, that “the book could not fail to be
improved by passing under your own supervision. In editing it for Clark’s Series, I translated
the greater part of it with my own hand and carefully revised the parts translated by others.
I was very much gratified to hear that you meant to adopt it into your Series; and the best
reward of my labor on it is that now with your additional notes and improvements, it is
likely to find a wider circulation than it could otherwise have had.”</p>
<p>But in this expectation the reader will be disappointed. The translation is far better than
I could have made it, and it would have been presumption on my part to attempt to improve
it. The notes, too, are all to the point and leave little to be desired. I have only added a few.
Besides the Latin original, I have compared also the German translation of Ulrich Uhl (Des
heiligen Kirchenvaters Augustinus zwei und zwanzig Bücher über den Gottesstaat) in the
Catholic “Bibliothek der Kirchenväter,” edited by Dr. Thalhofer, but I found nothing in the
occasional foot-notes which is better than those of Dr. Dods. The present edition, therefore,
is little more than a careful reproduction of that of my esteemed Scotch friend, who deserves
the undivided credit of making this famous work of the Bishop of Hippo accessible to the
English reader.</p>
<p>I have included in this volume the four books of St. Augustin On Christian Doctrine.3
It is the first and best patristic work on biblical Hermeneutics, and continued for a thousand

God nor Christian Doctrine. In French there are, it seems, no less than eight independent translations of the
Civitas Dei, the best by Emile Saisset, with introduction and notes, Paris, 1855, 4 vols. gr. in 18. Moreau’s

<p>TRANSLATED BY
REV. MARCUS DODS, D.D.</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">

<head>Translator’s Preface.</head>
<p>“Rome having been stormed and sacked by the Goths under Alaric their king,4 the
worshippers of false gods, or pagans, as we commonly call them, made an attempt to attribute
this calamity to the Christian religion, and began to blaspheme the true God with even more
than their wonted bitterness and acerbity. It was this which kindled my zeal for the house
of God, and prompted me to undertake the defence of the city of God against the charges
and misrepresentations of its assailants. This work was in my hands for several years, owing
to the interruptions occasioned by many other affairs which had a prior claim on my attention,
and which I could not defer. However, this great undertaking was at last completed
in twenty-two books. Of these, the first five refute those who fancy that the polytheistic
worship is necessary in order to secure worldly prosperity, and that all these overwhelming
calamities have befallen us in consequence of its prohibition. In the following five books I
address myself to those who admit that such calamities have at all times attended, and will
at all times attend, the human race, and that they constantly recur in forms more or less
disastrous, varying only in the scenes, occasions, and persons on whom they light, but, while
admitting this, maintain that the worship of the gods is advantageous for the life to come.
In these ten books, then, I refute these two opinions, which are as groundless as they are
antagonistic to the Christian religion.</p>
<p>“But that no one might have occasion to say, that though I had refuted the tenets of
other men, I had omitted to establish my own, I devote to this object the second part of this
work, which comprises twelve books, although I have not scrupled, as occasion offered,
either to advance my own opinions in the first ten books, or to demolish the arguments of
my opponents in the last twelve. Of these twelve books, the first four contain an account
of the origin of these two cities—the city of God, and the city of the world. The second four
treat of their history or progress; the third and last four, of their deserved destinies. And
so, though all these twenty-two books refer to both cities, yet I have named them after the
better city, and called them The City of God.”</p>
<p>Such is the account given by Augustin himself5 of the occasion and plan of this his
greatest work. But in addition to this explicit information, we learn from the correspondence6
of Augustin, that it was due to the importunity of his friend Marcellinus that this defence
of Christianity extended beyond the limits of a few letters. Shortly before the fall of Rome,
Marcellinus had been sent to Africa by the Emperor Honorius to arrange a settlement of

<pb n="9"/>
the differences between the Donatists and the Catholics. This brought him into contact not
only with Augustin, but with Volusian, the proconsul of Africa, and a man of rare intelligence
and candor. Finding that Volusian, though as yet a pagan, took an interest in the Christian
religion, Marcellinus set his heart on converting him to the true faith. The details of the
subsequent significant intercourse between the learned and courtly bishop and the two imperial
statesmen, are unfortunately almost entirely lost to us; but the impression conveyed
by the extant correspondence is, that Marcellinus was the means of bringing his two friends
into communication with one another. The first overture was on Augustin’s part, in the
shape of a simple and manly request that Volusian would carefully peruse the Scriptures,
accompanied by a frank offer to do his best to solve any difficulties that might arise from
such a course of inquiry. Volusian accordingly enters into correspondence with Augustin;
and in order to illustrate the kind of difficulties experienced by men in his position, he gives
some graphic notes of a conversation in which he had recently taken part at a gathering of
some of his friends. The difficulty to which most weight is attached in this letter, is the apparent
impossibility of believing in the Incarnation. But a letter which Marcellinus immediately
despatched to Augustin, urging him to reply to Volusian at large, brought the intelligence
that the difficulties and objections to Christianity were thus limited merely out of a
courteous regard to the preciousness of the bishop’s time, and the vast number of his engagements.
This letter, in short, brought out the important fact, that a removal of speculative
doubts would not suffice for the conversion of such men as Volusian, whose life was one
with the life of the empire. Their difficulties were rather political, historical, and social.
They could not see how the reception of the Christian rule of life was compat ible with the
interests of Rome as the mistress of the world.7 And thus Augustin was led to take a more
distinct and wider view of the whole relation which Christianity bore to the old state of
things,—moral, political, philosophical, and religious,—and was gradually drawn on to
undertake the elaborate work now presented to the English reader, and which may more
appropriately than any other of his writings be called his masterpiece8 or life-work. It was
begun the very year of Marcellinus’ death, a.d. 413, and was issued in detached portions
from time to time, until its completion in the year 426. It thus occupied the maturest years
of Augustin’s life—from his fifty-ninth to his seventy-second year.9</p>
<p>From this brief sketch, it will be seen that though the accompanying work is essentially
an Apology, the Apologetic of Augustin can be no mere rehabilitation of the somewhat
<note type="footnote">7 See some admirable remarks on this subject in the useful work of Beugnot, Histoire de la Destruction du
Paganisme, ii. 83 et sqq.</note>

work.”</note>

<pb n="10"/>
threadbare, if not effete, arguments of Justin and Tertullian.10 In fact, as Augustin considered
what was required of him,—to expound the Christian faith, and justify it to enlightened
men: to distinguish it from, and show its superiority to, all those forms of truth, philosophical
or popular, which were then striving for the mastery, or at least for standing-room; to
set before the world’s eye a vision of glory that might win the regard even of men who were
dazzled by the fascinating splendor of a world-wide empire,—he recognized that a task was
laid before him to which even his powers might prove unequal,—a task certainly which
would afford ample scope for his learning, dialectic, philosophical grasp and acumen, eloquence,
and faculty of exposition.</p>
<p>But it is the occasion of this great Apology which invests it at once with grandeur and
vitality. After more than eleven hundred years of steady and triumphant progress, Rome
had been taken and sacked. It is difficult for us to appreciate, impossible to overestimate,
the shock which was thus communicated from centre to circumference of the whole known
world. It was generally believed, not only by the heathen, but also by many of the most liberal-
minded of the Christians, that the destruction of Rome would be the prelude to the
destruction of the world.11 Even Jerome, who might have been supposed to be embittered
against the proud mistress of the world by her inhospitality to himself, cannot conceal his
profound emotion on hearing of her fall. “A terrible rumor,” he says, “reaches me from the
West telling of Rome besieged, bought for gold, besieged again, life and property perishing
together. My voice falters, sobs stifle the words I dictate; for she is a captive, that city which
enthralled the world.”12 Augustin is never so theatrical as Jerome in the expression of his
feeling, but he is equally explicit in lamenting the fall of Rome as a great calamity: and while
he does not scruple to ascribe her recent disgrace to the profligate manners, the effeminacy,
and the pride of her citizens, he is not without hope that, by a return to the simple, hardy,
and honorable mode of life which characterized the early Romans, she may still be restored
to much of her former prosperity.13 But as Augustin contemplates the ruins of Rome’s
greatness, and feels in common with all the world at this crisis, the instability of the strongest
<note type="footnote">10 “Hitherto the Apologies had been framed to meet particular exigencies: they were either brief and pregnant
statements of the Christian doctrines; refutations of prevalent calumnies; invectives against the follies and crimes
of Paganism; or confutations of anti-Christian works like those of Celsus, Porphyry, or Julian, closely following
their course of argument, and rarely expanding into general and comprehensive views of the great conflict.”—Milman,
History of Christianity, iii. c. 10. We are not acquainted with any more complete preface to the City of God
than is contained in the two or three pages which Milman has devoted to this subject.</note>

governments, the insufficiency of the most authoritative statesmanship, there hovers over
these ruins the splendid vision of the city of God “coming down out of heaven, adorned as
a bride for her husband.” The old social system is crumbling away on all sides, but in its
place he seems to see a pure Christendom arising. He sees that human history and human
destiny are not wholly identified with the history of any earthly power—not though it be as
cosmopolitan as the empire of Rome.14 He directs the attention of men to the fact that there
is another kingdom on earth,—a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is
God. He teaches men to take profounder views of history, and shows them how from the
first the city of God, or community of God’s people, has lived alongside of the kingdoms of
this world and their glory, and has been silently increasing, “crescit occulto velut arbor ævo.”
He demonstrates that the superior morality, the true doctrine, the heavenly origin of this
city, ensure it success; and over against this, he depicts the silly or contradictory theorizings
of the pagan philosophers, and the unhinged morals of the people, and puts it to all candid
men to say, whether in the presence of so manifestly sufficient a cause for Rome’s downfall,
there is room for imputing it to the spread of Christianity. He traces the antagonism of
these two grand communities of rational creatures back to their first divergence in the fall
of the angels, and down to the consummation of all things in the last judgment and eternal
destination of the good and evil. In other words, the city of God is “the first real effort to
produce a philosophy of history,”15 to exhibit historical events in connection with their true
causes, and in their real sequence. This plan of the work is not only a great conception, but
it is accompanied with many practical advantages; the chief of which is, that it admits, and
even requires, a full treatment of those doctrines of our faith that are more directly historical,—
the doctrines of creation, the fall, the incarnation, the connection between the Old and
New Testaments, and the doctrine of “the last things.”16</p>
<p>The effect produced by this great work it is impossible to determine with accuracy.
Beugnot, with an absoluteness which we should condemn as presumption in any less competent
authority, declares that its effect can only have been very slight.17 Probably its effect
would be silent and slow; telling first upon cultivated minds, and only indirectly upon the
people. Certainly its effect must have been weakened by the interrupted manner of its
publication. It is an easier task to estimate its intrinsic value. But on this also patristic and

grandeur of the ideas it contains.</note>

<pb n="12"/>
literary authorities widely differ. Dupin admits that it is very pleasant reading, owing to the
surprising variety of matters which are introduced to illustrate and forward the argument,
but censures the author for discussing very useless questions, and for adducing reasons
which could satisfy no one who was not already convinced.18 Huet also speaks of the book
as “un amas confus d’excellents materiaux; c’est de l’or en barre et en lingots.”19 L’Abbé
Flottes censures these opinions as unjust, and cites with approbation the unqualified eulogy
of Pressensé.20 But probably the popularity of the book is its best justification. This popularity
may be measured by the circumstance that, between the year 1467 and the end of
the fifteenth century, no fewer than twenty editions were called for, that is to say, a fresh
edition every eighteen months.21 And in the interesting series of letters that passed between
Ludovicus Vives and Erasmus, who had engaged him to write a commentary on the City of
God for his edition of Augustin’s works, we find Vives pleading for a separate edition of this
work, on the plea that, of all the writings of Augustin, it was almost the only one read by
patristic students, and might therefore naturally be expected to have a much wider circulation.22</p>
<p>If it were asked to what this popularity is due, we should be disposed to attribute it
mainly to the great variety of ideas, opinions, and facts that are here brought before the
reader’s mind. Its importance as a contribution to the history of opinion cannot be overrated.
We find in it not only indications or explicit enouncement of the author’s own views upon
almost every important topic which occupied his thoughts, but also a compendious exhibition
of the ideas which most powerfully influenced the life at that age. It thus becomes, as Poujoulat
says, “comme l’encyclopédie du cinquième siècle.” All that is valuable, together with
much indeed that is not so, in the religion and philosophy of the classical nations of antiquity,
is reviewed. And on some branches of these subjects it has, in the judgment of one well
qualified to judge, “preserved more than the whole surviving Latin literature.” It is true we
are sometimes wearied by the too elaborate refutation of opinions which to a modern mind
seem self-evident absurdities; but if these opinions were actually prevalent in the fifth century,
the historical inquirer will not quarrel with the form in which his information is conveyed,

nor will commit the absurdity of attributing to Augustin the foolishness of these opinions,
but rather the credit of exploding them. That Augustin is a well-informed and impartial
critic, is evinced by the courteousness and candor which he uniformly displays to his opponents,
by the respect he won from the heathen themselves, and by his own early life. The
most rigorous criticism has found him at fault regarding matters of fact only in some very
rare instances, which can be easily accounted for. His learning would not indeed stand
comparison with what is accounted such in our day: his life was too busy, and too devoted
to the poor and to the spiritually necessitous, to admit of any extraordinary acquisition. He
had access to no literature but the Latin; or at least he had only sufficient Greek to enable
him to refer to Greek authors on points of importance, and not enough to enable him to
read their writings with ease and pleasure.23 But he had a profound knowledge of his own
time, and a familiar acquaintance not only with the Latin poets, but with many other authors,
some of whose writings are now lost to us, save the fragments preserved through his quotations.</p>
<p>But the interest attaching to the City of God is not merely historical. It is the earnestness
and ability with which he develops his own philosophical and theological views which
gradually fascinate the reader, and make him see why the world has set this among the few
greatest books of all time. The fundamental lines of the Augustinian theology are here laid
down in a comprehensive and interesting form. Never was thought so abstract expressed
in language so popular. He handles metaphysical problems with the unembarrassed ease
of Plato, with all Cicero’s accuracy and acuteness, and more than Cicero’s profundity. He
is never more at home than when exposing the incompetency of Neoplatonism, or demonstrating
the harmony of Christian doctrine and true philosophy. And though there are in
the City of God, as in all ancient books, things that seem to us childish and barren, there are
also the most surprising anticipations of modern speculation. There is an earnest grappling
with those problems which are continually re-opened because they underlie man’s relation
to God and the spiritual world,—the problems which are not peculiar to any one century.

<p>It is true, the style of the book is not all that could be desired: there are passages which
can possess an interest only to the antiquarian; there are others with nothing to redeem
them but the glow of their eloquence; there are many repetitions; there is an occasional use
of arguments “plus ingenieux que solides,” as M. Saisset says. Augustin’s great admirer,
Erasmus, does not scruple to call him a writer “obscuræ, subtilitatis et parum amoenæ prolixitatis;
24but “the toil of penetrating the apparent obscurities will be rewarded by finding
a real wealth of insight and enlightenment.” Some who have read the opening chapters of
the City of God, may have considered it would be a waste of time to proceed; but no one,
we are persuaded, ever regretted reading it all. The book has its faults; but it effectually introduces
us to the most influential of theologians, and the greatest popular teacher; to a
genius that cannot nod for many lines together; to a reasoner whose dialectic is more formidable,
more keen and sifting, than that of Socrates or Aquinas; to a saint whose ardent
and genuine devotional feeling bursts up through the severest argumentation; to a man
whose kindliness and wit, universal sympathies and breadth of intelligence, lend piquancy
and vitality to the most abstract dissertation.</p>
<p>The propriety of publishing a translation of so choice a specimen of ancient literature
needs no defence. As Poujoulat very sensibly remarks, there are not a great many men nowa-
days who will read a work in Latin of twenty-two books. Perhaps there are fewer still who
ought to do so. With our busy neighbors in France, this work has been a prime favorite for
400 years. There may be said to be eight independent translations of it into the French
tongue, though some of these are in part merely revisions. One of these translations has
gone through as many as four editions. The most recent is that which forms part of the
Nisard series; but the best, so far as we have seen, is that of the accomplished Professor of
Philosophy in the College of France, Emile Saisset. This translation is indeed all that can
be desired: here and there an omission occurs, and about one or two renderings a difference
of opinion may exist; but the exceeding felicity and spirit of the whole show it to have been
a labor of love, the fond homage of a disciple proud of his master. The preface of M. Saisset
is one of the most valuable contributions ever made to the understanding of Augustin’s
philosophy.25</p>
<p>Of English translations there has been an unaccountable poverty. Only one exists,26
and this so exceptionally bad, so unlike the racy translations of the seventeenth century in
general, so inaccurate, and so frequently unintelligible, that it is not impossible it may have

present translation also might be improved, we know; that many men were fitter for the
task, on the score of scholarship, we are very sensible; but that any one would have executed
it with intenser affection and veneration for the author, we are not prepared to admit. A

<head>Preface, Explaining His Design in Undertaking This Work.</head>
<p>The glorious city of God28 is my theme in this work, which you, my dearest son Marcellinus,
29 suggested, and which is due to you by my promise. I have undertaken its defence
against those who prefer their own gods to the Founder of this city,—a city surpassingly
glorious, whether we view it as it still lives by faith in this fleeting course of time, and sojourns
as a stranger in the midst of the ungodly, or as it shall dwell in the fixed stability of its
eternal seat, which it now with patience waits for, expecting until “righteousness shall return
unto judgment,”30 and it obtain, by virtue of its excellence, final victory and perfect peace.
A great work this, and an arduous; but God is my helper. For I am aware what ability is
requisite to persuade the proud how great is the virtue of humility, which raises us, not by
a quite human arrogance, but by a divine grace, above all earthly dignities that totter on this
shifting scene. For the King and Founder of this city of which we speak, has in Scripture
uttered to His people a dictum of the divine law in these words: “God resisteth the proud,
but giveth grace unto the humble.”31 But this, which is God’s prerogative, the inflated ambition
of a proud spirit also affects, and dearly loves that this be numbered among its attributes,
to
<lg>
<l>“Show pity to the humbled soul,</l>
<l>And crush the sons of pride.”32</l>

<note type="footnote">28[Augustin uses the term civitas Dei (πόλις θεοῦ) of the church universal as a commonwealth and community
founded and governed by God. It is applied in the Bible to Jerusalem or the church of the Old Covenant (Ps.
xl. 6, 4; xlviii. 1, 8; lxxxvii. 3), and to the heavenly Jerusalem or the church perfect (Heb. xi. 10, 16; xii. 22; Rev.
iii. 12; xxi. 2; xxii. 14, 19). Augustin comprehends under the term the whole Kingdom of God under the Jewish
and Christian dispensation both in its militant and triumphant state, and contrasts it with the perishing kingdoms
of this world. His work treats of both, but he calls it, a meliore, The City of God.—P.S.]</note>

he fell a victim to their revenge, and was honored by a place among the martyrs. See the Letters of Augustin,

<head>Chapter 1.—Of the Adversaries of the Name of Christ, Whom the Barbarians for
Christ’s Sake Spared When They Stormed the City.</head>
<p>For to this earthly city belong the enemies against whom I have to defend the city of
God. Many of them, indeed, being reclaimed from their ungodly error, have become suffi-
ciently creditable citizens of this city; but many are so inflamed with hatred against it, and
are so ungrateful to its Redeemer for His signal benefits, as to forget that they would now
be unable to utter a single word to its prejudice, had they not found in its sacred places, as
they fled from the enemy’s steel, that life in which they now boast themselves.33 Are not
those very Romans, who were spared by the barbarians through their respect for Christ,
become enemies to the name of Christ? The reliquaries of the martyrs and the churches of
the apostles bear witness to this; for in the sack of the city they were open sanctuary for all
who fled to them, whether Christian or Pagan. To their very threshold the blood-thirsty
enemy raged; there his murderous fury owned a limit. Thither did such of the enemy as
had any pity convey those to whom they had given quarter, lest any less mercifully disposed
might fall upon them. And, indeed, when even those murderers who everywhere else showed
themselves pitiless came to those spots where that was forbidden which the license of war
permitted in every other place, their furious rage for slaughter was bridled, and their
eagerness to take prisoners was quenched. Thus escaped multitudes who now reproach the
Christian religion, and impute to Christ the ills that have befallen their city; but the preservation
of their own life—a boon which they owe to the respect entertained for Christ by the
barbarians—they attribute not to our Christ, but to their own good luck. They ought rather,
had they any right perceptions, to attribute the severities and hardships inflicted by their
enemies, to that divine providence which is wont to reform the depraved manners of men
by chastisement, and which exercises with similar afflictions the righteous and praiseworthy,—
either translating them, when they have passed through the trial, to a better world,
or detaining them still on earth for ulterior purposes. And they ought to attribute it to the
spirit of these Christian times, that, contrary to the custom of war, these bloodthirsty barbarians
spared them, and spared them for Christ’s sake, whether this mercy was actually
shown in promiscuous places, or in those places specially dedicated to Christ’s name, and
of which the very largest were selected as sanctuaries, that full scope might thus be given to
the expansive compassion which desired that a large multitude might find shelter there.
Therefore ought they to give God thanks, and with sincere confession flee for refuge to His
name, that so they may escape the punishment of eternal fire—they who with lying lips took

of those whom you see insolently and shamelessly insulting the servants of Christ, there are
numbers who would not have escaped that destruction and slaughter had they not pretended
that they themselves were Christ’s servants. Yet now, in ungrateful pride and most impious
madness, and at the risk of being punished in everlasting darkness, they perversely oppose
that name under which they fraudulently protected themselves for the sake of enjoying the
light of this brief life.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—That It is Quite Contrary to the Usage of War, that the Victors Should
Spare the Vanquished for the Sake of Their Gods.</head>
<p>There are histories of numberless wars, both before the building of Rome and since its
rise and the extension of its dominion; let these be read, and let one instance be cited in
which, when a city had been taken by foreigners, the victors spared those who were found
to have fled for sanctuary to the temples of their gods;34 or one instance in which a barbarian
general gave orders that none should be put to the sword who had been found in this
or that temple. Did not Æneas see
<lg>
<l rend="indent">“Dying Priam at the shrine,</l>
<l>Staining the hearth he made divine?”35</l>
<l>Did not Diomede and Ulysses</l>
<l>“Drag with red hands, the sentry slain,</l>
<l>Her fateful image from your fane,</l>
<l>Her chaste locks touch, and stain with gore</l>
<l>The virgin coronal she wore?”36</l>
<l>Neither is that true which follows, that</l>
<l>“Thenceforth the tide of fortune changed,</l>
<l>And Greece grew weak.”37</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>For after this they conquered and destroyed Troy with fire and sword; after this they
beheaded Priam as he fled to the altars. Neither did Troy perish because it lost Minerva.
For what had Minerva herself first lost, that she should perish? Her guards perhaps? No
doubt; just her guards. For as soon as they were slain, she could be stolen. It was not, in
fact, the men who were preserved by the image, but the image by the men. How, then, was
she invoked to defend the city and the citizens, she who could not defend her own defenders?</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—That the Romans Did Not Show Their Usual Sagacity When They
Trusted that They Would Be Benefited by the Gods Who Had Been Unable to
Defend Troy.</head>
<p>And these be the gods to whose protecting care the Romans were delighted to entrust
their city! O too, too piteous mistake! And they are enraged at us when we speak thus about
their gods, though, so far from being enraged at their own writers, they part with money to
learn what they say; and, indeed, the very teachers of these authors are reckoned worthy of
a salary from the public purse, and of other honors. There is Virgil, who is read by boys, in
order that this great poet, this most famous and approved of all poets, may impregnate their
virgin minds, and may not readily be forgotten by them, according to that saying of Horace,</p>
<p>“The fresh cask long keeps its first tang.”38</p>
<p>Well, in this Virgil, I say, Juno is introduced as hostile to the Trojans, and stirring up
Æolus, the king of the winds, against them in the words,
<lg>
<l>“A race I hate now ploughs the sea,</l>
<l>Transporting Troy to Italy,</l>
<l>And home-gods conquered”39<gap reason="omitted"/></l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And ought prudent men to have entrusted the defence of Rome to these conquered
gods? But it will be said, this was only the saying of Juno, who, like an angry woman, did
not know what she was saying. What, then, says Æneas himself,—Æneas who is so often
designated “pious?” Does he not say,
<lg>
<l>“Lo! Panthus, ’scaped from death by flight,</l>
<l>Priest of Apollo on the height,</l>
<l>His conquered gods with trembling hands</l>
<l>He bears, and shelter swift demands?”40</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Is it not clear that the gods (whom he does not scruple to call “conquered”) were rather
entrusted to Æneas than he to them, when it is said to him,
<lg>
<l>“The gods of her domestic shrines</l>
<l>Your country to your care consigns?”41</l>

<pb n="23"/>
<p>If, then, Virgil says that the gods were such as these, and were conquered, and that when
conquered they could not escape except under the protection of a man, what a madness is
it to suppose that Rome had been wisely entrusted to these guardians, and could not have
been taken unless it had lost them! Indeed, to worship conquered gods as protectors and
champions, what is this but to worship, not good divinities, but evil omens?42 Would it not
be wiser to believe, not that Rome would never have fallen into so great a calamity had not
they first perished, but rather that they would have perished long since had not Rome preserved
them as long as she could? For who does not see, when he thinks of it, what a foolish
assumption it is that they could not be vanquished under vanquished defenders, and that
they only perished because they had lost their guardian gods, when, indeed, the only cause
of their perishing was that they chose for their protectors gods condemned to perish? The
poets, therefore, when they composed and sang these things about the conquered gods, had
no intention to invent falsehoods, but uttered, as honest men, what the truth extorted from
them. This, however, will be carefully and copiously discussed in another and more fitting
place. Meanwhile I will briefly, and to the best of my ability, explain what I meant to say
about these ungrateful men who blasphemously impute to Christ the calamities which they
deservedly suffer in consequence of their own wicked ways, while that which is for Christ’s
sake spared them in spite of their wickedness they do not even take the trouble to notice;
and in their mad and blasphemous insolence, they use against His name those very lips
wherewith they falsely claimed that same name that their lives might be spared. In the places
consecrated to Christ, where for His sake no enemy would injure them, they restrained their
tongues that they might be safe and protected; but no sooner do they emerge from these
sanctuaries, than they unbridle these tongues to hurl against Him curses full of hate.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Of the Asylum of Juno in Troy, Which Saved No One from the Greeks;
And of the Churches of the Apostles, Which Protected from the Barbarians All
Who Fled to Them.</head>
<p>Troy itself, the mother of the Roman people, was not able, as I have said, to protect its
own citizens in the sacred places of their gods from the fire and sword of the Greeks, though
the Greeks worshipped the same gods. Not only so, but
<lg>
<l>“Phoenix and Ulysses fell</l>

</lg>
</p>
<p>In other words, the place consecrated to so great a goddess was chosen, not that from
it none might be led out a captive, but that in it all the captives might be immured. Compare
now this “asylum”—the asylum not of an ordinary god, not of one of the rank and file of
gods, but of Jove’s own sister and wife, the queen of all the gods—with the churches built
in memory of the apostles. Into it were collected the spoils rescued from the blazing temples
and snatched from the gods, not that they might be restored to the vanquished, but divided
among the victors; while into these was carried back, with the most religious observance
and respect, everything which belonged to them, even though found elsewhere. There liberty
was lost; here preserved. There bondage was strict; here strictly excluded. Into that temple
men were driven to become the chattels of their enemies, now lording it over them; into
these churches men were led by their relenting foes, that they might be at liberty. In fine,
the gentle44 Greeks appropriated that temple of Juno to the purposes of their own avarice
and pride; while these churches of Christ were chosen even by the savage barbarians as the
fit scenes for humility and mercy. But perhaps, after all, the Greeks did in that victory of
theirs spare the temples of those gods whom they worshipped in common with the Trojans,
and did not dare to put to the sword or make captive the wretched and vanquished Trojans

veracity, writes45) “that virgins and boys are violated, children torn from the embrace of
their parents, matrons subjected to whatever should be the pleasure of the conquerors,
temples and houses plundered, slaughter and burning rife; in fine, all things filled with arms,
corpses, blood, and wailing.” If he had not mentioned temples here, we might suppose that
enemies were in the habit of sparing the dwellings of the gods. And the Roman temples
were in danger of these disasters, not from foreign foes, but from Catiline and his associates,
the most noble senators and citizens of Rome. But these, it may be said, were abandoned
men, and the parricides of their fatherland.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—That Not Even the Romans, When They Took Cities, Spared the
Conquered in Their Temples.</head>
<p>Why, then, need our argument take note of the many nations who have waged wars
with one another, and have nowhere spared the conquered in the temples of their gods?
Let us look at the practice of the Romans themselves; let us, I say, recall and review the Romans,
whose chief praise it has been “to spare the vanquished and subdue the proud,” and
that they preferred “rather to forgive than to revenge an injury;”46 and among so many and
great cities which they have stormed, taken, and overthrown for the extension of their
dominion, let us be told what temples they were accustomed to exempt, so that whoever
took refuge in them was free. Or have they really done this, and has the fact been suppressed
by the historians of these events? Is it to be believed, that men who sought out with the
greatest eagerness points they could praise, would omit those which, in their own estimation,
are the most signal proofs of piety? Marcus Marcellus, a distinguished Roman, who took
Syracuse, a most splendidly adorned city, is reported to have bewailed its coming ruin, and
to have shed his own tears over it before he spilt its blood. He took steps also to preserve
the chastity even of his enemy. For before he gave orders for the storming of the city, he
issued an edict forbidding the violation of any free person. Yet the city was sacked according
to the custom of war; nor do we anywhere read, that even by so chaste and gentle a commander
orders were given that no one should be injured who had fled to this or that temple.
And this certainly would by no means have been omitted, when neither his weeping nor
his edict preservative of chastity could be passed in silence. Fabius, the conqueror of the
city of Tarentum, is praised for abstaining from making booty of the images. For when his
secretary proposed the question to him, what he wished done with the statues of the gods,
which had been taken in large numbers, he veiled his moderation under a joke. For he asked
of what sort they were; and when they reported to him that there were not only many large
images, but some of them armed, “Oh,” says he, “let us leave with the Tarentines their angry
gods.” Seeing, then, that the writers of Roman history could not pass in silence, neither the
weeping of the one general nor the laughing of the other, neither the chaste pity of the one
nor the facetious moderation of the other, on what occasion would it be omitted, if, for the
honor of any of their enemy’s gods, they had shown this particular form of leniency, that
in any temple slaughter or captivity was prohibited?</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—That the Cruelties Which Occurred in the Sack of Rome Were in Accordance
with the Custom of War, Whereas the Acts of Clemency Resulted from
the Influence of Christ’s Name.</head>
<p>All the spoiling, then, which Rome was exposed to in the recent calamity—all the
slaughter, plundering, burning, and misery—was the result of the custom of war. But what
was novel, was that savage barbarians showed themselves in so gentle a guise, that the largest
churches were chosen and set apart for the purpose of being filled with the people to whom
quarter was given, and that in them none were slain, from them none forcibly dragged; that
into them many were led by their relenting enemies to be set at liberty, and that from them
none were led into slavery by merciless foes. Whoever does not see that this is to be attributed
to the name of Christ, and to the Christian temper, is blind; whoever sees this, and gives no
praise, is ungrateful; whoever hinders any one from praising it, is mad. Far be it from any
prudent man to impute this clemency to the barbarians. Their fierce and bloody minds
were awed, and bridled, and marvellously tempered by Him who so long before said by His
prophet, “I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes; nevertheless
my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from them.”47</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Of the Advantages and Disadvantages Which Often Indiscriminately
Accrue to Good and Wicked Men.</head>
<p>Will some one say, Why, then, was this divine compassion extended even to the ungodly
and ungrateful? Why, but because it was the mercy of Him who daily “maketh His sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”48 For
though some of these men, taking thought of this, repent of their wickedness and reform,
some, as the apostle says, “despising the riches of His goodness and long-suffering, after
their hardness and impenitent heart, treasure up unto themselves wrath against the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man according
to his deeds:”49 nevertheless does the patience of God still invite the wicked to repentance,
even as the scourge of God educates the good to patience. And so, too, does the
mercy of God embrace the good that it may cherish them, as the severity of God arrests the
wicked to punish them. To the divine providence it has seemed good to prepare in the
world to come for the righteous good things, which the unrighteous shall not enjoy; and for
the wicked evil things, by which the good shall not be tormented. But as for the good things
of this life, and its ills, God has willed that these should be common to both; that we might
not too eagerly covet the things which wicked men are seen equally to enjoy, nor shrink
with an unseemly fear from the ills which even good men often suffer.</p>
<p>There is, too, a very great difference in the purpose served both by those events which
we call adverse and those called prosperous. For the good man is neither uplifted with the
good things of time, nor broken by its ills; but the wicked man, because he is corrupted by
this world’s happiness, feels himself punished by its unhappiness.50 Yet often, even in the
present distribution of temporal things, does God plainly evince His own interference. For
if every sin were now visited with manifest punishment, nothing would seem to be reserved
for the final judgment; on the other hand, if no sin received now a plainly divine punishment,
it would be concluded that there is no divine providence at all. And so of the good things
of this life: if God did not by a very visible liberality confer these on some of those persons
who ask for them, we should say that these good things were not at His disposal; and if He
gave them to all who sought them, we should suppose that such were the only rewards of
His service; and such a service would make us not godly, but greedy rather, and covetous.
Wherefore, though good and bad men suffer alike, we must not suppose that there is no

<pb n="30"/>
difference between the men themselves, because there is no difference in what they both
suffer. For even in the likeness of the sufferings, there remains an unlikeness in the sufferers;
and though exposed to the same anguish, virtue and vice are not the same thing. For as the
same fire causes gold to glow brightly, and chaff to smoke; and under the same flail the straw
is beaten small, while the grain is cleansed; and as the lees are not mixed with the oil, though
squeezed out of the vat by the same pressure, so the same violence of affliction proves,
purges, clarifies the good, but damns, ruins, exterminates the wicked. And thus it is that in
the same affliction the wicked detest God and blaspheme, while the good pray and praise.
So material a difference does it make, not what ills are suffered, but what kind of man suffers
them. For, stirred up with the same movement, mud exhales a horrible stench, and ointment
emits a fragrant odor.</p>

<pb n="31"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—Of the Reasons for Administering Correction to Bad and Good Together.</head>
<p>What, then, have the Christians suffered in that calamitous period, which would not
profit every one who duly and faithfully considered the following circumstances? First of
all, they must humbly consider those very sins which have provoked God to fill the world
with such terrible disasters; for although they be far from the excesses of wicked, immoral,
and ungodly men, yet they do not judge themselves so clean removed from all faults as to
be too good to suffer for these even temporal ills. For every man, however laudably he lives,
yet yields in some points to the lust of the flesh. Though he do not fall into gross enormity
of wickedness, and abandoned viciousness, and abominable profanity, yet he slips into some
sins, either rarely or so much the more frequently as the sins seem of less account. But not
to mention this, where can we readily find a man who holds in fit and just estimation those
persons on account of whose revolting pride, luxury, and avarice, and cursed iniquities and
impiety, God now smites the earth as His predictions threatened? Where is the man who
lives with them in the style in which it becomes us to live with them? For often we wickedly
blind ourselves to the occasions of teaching and admonishing them, sometimes even of
reprimanding and chiding them, either because we shrink from the labor or are ashamed
to offend them, or because we fear to lose good friendships, lest this should stand in the way
of our advancement, or injure us in some worldly matter, which either our covetous disposition
desires to obtain, or our weakness shrinks from losing. So that, although the conduct
of wicked men is distasteful to the good, and therefore they do not fall with them into that
damnation which in the next life awaits such persons, yet, because they spare their damnable
sins through fear, therefore, even though their own sins be slight and venial, they are justly
scourged with the wicked in this world, though in eternity they quite escape punishment.
Justly, when God afflicts them in common with the wicked, do they find this life bitter,
through love of whose sweetness they declined to be bitter to these sinners.</p>
<p>If any one forbears to reprove and find fault with those who are doing wrong, because
he seeks a more seasonable opportunity, or because he fears they may be made worse by his
rebuke, or that other weak persons may be disheartened from endeavoring to lead a good
and pious life, and may be driven from the faith; this man’s omission seems to be occasioned
not by covetousness, but by a charitable consideration. But what is blame-worthy is, that
they who themselves revolt from the conduct of the wicked, and live in quite another fashion,
yet spare those faults in other men which they ought to reprehend and wean them from;
and spare them because they fear to give offence, lest they should injure their interests in
those things which good men may innocently and legitimately use,—though they use them
more greedily than becomes persons who are strangers in this world, and profess the hope
of a heavenly country. For not only the weaker brethren who enjoy married life, and have
children (or desire to have them), and own houses and establishments, whom the apostle
addresses in the churches, warning and instructing them how they should live, both the

<pb n="32"/>
wives with their husbands, and the husbands with their wives, the children with their parents,
and parents with their children, and servants with their masters, and masters with their
servants,—not only do these weaker brethren gladly obtain and grudgingly lose many earthly
and temporal things on account of which they dare not offend men whose polluted and
wicked life greatly displeases them; but those also who live at a higher level, who are not
entangled in the meshes of married life, but use meagre food and raiment, do often take
thought of their own safety and good name, and abstain from finding fault with the wicked,
because they fear their wiles and violence. And although they do not fear them to such an
extent as to be drawn to the commission of like iniquities, nay, not by any threats or violence
soever; yet those very deeds which they refuse to share in the commission of, they often
decline to find fault with (when possibly they might) by finding fault prevent their commission.
They abstain from interference, because they fear that, if it fail of good effect, their
own safety or reputation may be damaged or destroyed; not because they see that their
preservation and good name are needful, that they may be able to influence those who need
their instruction, but rather because they weakly relish the flattery and respect of men, and
fear the judgments of the people, and the pain or death of the body; that is to say, their nonintervention
is the result of selfishness, and not of love.</p>
<p>Accordingly this seems to me to be one principal reason why the good are chastised
along with the wicked, when God is pleased to visit with temporal punishments the profligate
manners of a community. They are punished together, not because they have spent an
equally corrupt life, but because the good as well as the wicked, though not equally with
them, love this present life; while they ought to hold it cheap, that the wicked, being admonished
and reformed by their example, might lay hold of life eternal. And if they will not be
the companions of the good in seeking life everlasting, they should be loved as enemies, and
be dealt with patiently. For so long as they live, it remains uncertain whether they may not
come to a better mind. These selfish persons have more cause to fear than those to whom
it was said through the prophet, “He is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require
at the watchman’s hand.”51 For watchmen or overseers of the people are appointed in
churches, that they may unsparingly rebuke sin. Nor is that man guiltless of the sin we
speak of, who, though he be not a watchman, yet sees in the conduct of those with whom
the relationships of this life bring him into contact, many things that should be blamed, and
yet overlooks them, fearing to give offence, and lose such worldly blessings as may legitimately
be desired, but which he too eagerly grasps. Then, lastly, there is another reason why the
good are afflicted with temporal calamities—the reason which Job’s case exemplifies: that
the human spirit may be proved, and that it may be manifested with what fortitude of pious
trust, and with how unmercenary a love, it cleaves to God.52</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—That the Saints Lose Nothing in Losing Temporal Goods.</head>
<p>These are the considerations which one must keep in view, that he may answer the
question whether any evil happens to the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to
profit. Or shall we say that the question is needless, and that the apostle is vaporing when
he says, “We know that all things work together for good to them that love God?”53</p>
<p>They lost all they had. Their faith? Their godliness? The possessions of the hidden
man of the heart, which in the sight of God are of great price?54 Did they lose these? For
these are the wealth of Christians, to whom the wealthy apostle said, “Godliness with contentment
is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
carry nothing out. And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. But they that
will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which
drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which,
while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through
with many sorrows.”55</p>
<p>They, then, who lost their worldly all in the sack of Rome, if they owned their possessions
as they had been taught by the apostle, who himself was poor without, but rich within,—that
is to say, if they used the world as not using it,—could say in the words of Job, heavily tried,
but not overcome: “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return
thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it pleased the Lord, so has it come
to pass: blessed be the name of the Lord.”56 Like a good servant, Job counted the will of
his Lord his great possession, by obedience to which his soul was enriched; nor did it grieve
him to lose, while yet living, those goods which he must shortly leave at his death. But as
to those feebler spirits who, though they cannot be said to prefer earthly possessions to
Christ, do yet cleave to them with a somewhat immoderate attachment, they have discovered
by the pain of losing these things how much they were sinning in loving them. For their
grief is of their own making; in the words of the apostle quoted above, “they have pierced
themselves through with many sorrows.” For it was well that they who had so long despised
these verbal admonitions should receive the teaching of experience. For when the apostle
says, “They that will be rich fall into temptation,” and so on, what he blames in riches is not
the possession of them, but the desire of them. For elsewhere he says, “Charge them that
are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in
the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich
in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves

<pb n="34"/>
a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”57 They
who were making such a use of their property have been consoled for light losses by great
gains, and have had more pleasure in those possessions which they have securely laid past,
by freely giving them away, than grief in those which they entirely lost by an anxious and
selfish hoarding of them. For nothing could perish on earth save what they would be ashamed
to carry away from earth. Our Lord’s injunction runs, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures
upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal;
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also.”58 And they who have listened to this injunction have proved in the time of
tribulation how well they were advised in not despising this most trustworthy teacher, and
most faithful and mighty guardian of their treasure. For if many were glad that their treasure
was stored in places which the enemy chanced not to light upon, how much better founded
was the joy of those who, by the counsel of their God, had fled with their treasure to a citadel
which no enemy can possibly reach! Thus our Paulinus, bishop of Nola,59 who voluntarily
abandoned vast wealth and became quite poor, though abundantly rich in holiness, when
the barbarians sacked Nola, and took him prisoner, used silently to pray, as he afterwards
told me, “O Lord, let me not be troubled for gold and silver, for where all my treasure is
Thou knowest.” For all his treasure was where he had been taught to hide and store it by
Him who had also foretold that these calamities would happen in the world. Consequently
those persons who obeyed their Lord when He warned them where and how to lay up
treasure, did not lose even their earthly possessions in the invasion of the barbarians; while
those who are now repenting that they did not obey Him have learnt the right use of earthly
goods, if not by the wisdom which would have prevented their loss, at least by the experience
which follows it.</p>
<p>But some good and Christian men have been put to the torture, that they might be
forced to deliver up their goods to the enemy. They could indeed neither deliver nor lose
that good which made themselves good. If, however, they preferred torture to the surrender
of the mammon of iniquity, then I say they were not good men. Rather they should have
been reminded that, if they suffered so severely for the sake of money, they should endure
all torment, if need be, for Christ’s sake; that they might be taught to love Him rather who
enriches with eternal felicity all who suffer for Him, and not silver and gold, for which it

was pitiable to suffer, whether they preserved it by telling a lie or lost it by telling the truth.
For under these tortures no one lost Christ by confessing Him, no one preserved wealth
save by denying its existence. So that possibly the torture which taught them that they
should set their affections on a possession they could not lose, was more useful than those
possessions which, without any useful fruit at all, disquieted and tormented their anxious
owners. But then we are reminded that some were tortured who had no wealth to surrender,
but who were not believed when they said so. These too, however, had perhaps some craving
for wealth, and were not willingly poor with a holy resignation; and to such it had to be
made plain, that not the actual possession alone, but also the desire of wealth, deserved such
excruciating pains. And even if they were destitute of any hidden stores of gold and silver,
because they were living in hopes of a better life,—I know not indeed if any such person
was tortured on the supposition that he had wealth; but if so, then certainly in confessing,
when put to the question, a holy poverty, he confessed Christ. And though it was scarcely
to be expected that the barbarians should believe him, yet no confessor of a holy poverty
could be tortured without receiving a heavenly reward.</p>
<p>Again, they say that the long famine laid many a Christian low. But this, too, the faithful
turned to good uses by a pious endurance of it. For those whom famine killed outright it
rescued from the ills of this life, as a kindly disease would have done; and those who were
only hunger-bitten were taught to live more sparingly, and inured to longer fasts.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Of the End of This Life, Whether It is Material that It Be Long Delayed.</head>
<p>But, it is added, many Christians were slaughtered, and were put to death in a hideous
variety of cruel ways. Well, if this be hard to bear, it is assuredly the common lot of all who
are born into this life. Of this at least I am certain, that no one has ever died who was not
destined to die some time. Now the end of life puts the longest life on a par with the shortest.
For of two things which have alike ceased to be, the one is not better, the other worse—the
one greater, the other less.60 And of what consequence is it what kind of death puts an end
to life, since he who has died once is not forced to go through the same ordeal a second
time? And as in the daily casualties of life every man is, as it were, threatened with numberless
deaths, so long as it remains uncertain which of them is his fate, I would ask whether it is
not better to suffer one and die, than to live in fear of all? I am not unaware of the poorspirited
fear which prompts us to choose rather to live long in fear of so many deaths, than
to die once and so escape them all; but the weak and cowardly shrinking of the flesh is one
thing, and the well-considered and reasonable persuasion of the soul quite another. That
death is not to be judged an evil which is the end of a good life; for death becomes evil only
by the retribution which follows it. They, then, who are destined to die, need not be careful
to inquire what death they are to die, but into what place death will usher them. And since
Christians are well aware that the death of the godly pauper whose sores the dogs licked was
far better than of the wicked rich man who lay in purple and fine linen, what harm could
these terrific deaths do to the dead who had lived well?</p>
<note type="footnote">60 Much of a kindred nature might be gathered from the Stoics. Antoninus says (ii. 14): “Though thou
shouldest be going to live 3000 years, and as many times 10,000 years, still remember that no man loses any
other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses. The longest and the
shortest are thus brought to the same.”</note>

<head>Chapter 12.—Of the Burial of the Dead: that the Denial of It to Christians Does
Them No Injury.61</head>
<p>Further still, we are reminded that in such a carnage as then occurred, the bodies could
not even be buried. But godly confidence is not appalled by so ill-omened a circumstance;
for the faithful bear in mind that assurance has been given that not a hair of their head shall
perish, and that, therefore, though they even be devoured by beasts, their blessed resurrection
will not hereby be hindered. The Truth would nowise have said, “Fear not them which kill
the body, but are not able to kill the soul,”62 if anything whatever that an enemy could do
to the body of the slain could be detrimental to the future life. Or will some one perhaps
take so absurd a position as to contend that those who kill the body are not to be feared before
death, and lest they kill the body, but after death, lest they deprive it of burial? If this be so,
then that is false which Christ says, “Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that
have no more that they can do;”63 for it seems they can do great injury to the dead body.
Far be it from us to suppose that the Truth can be thus false. They who kill the body are
said “to do something,” because the deathblow is felt, the body still having sensation; but
after that, they have no more that they can do, for in the slain body there is no sensation.
And so there are indeed many bodies of Christians lying unburied; but no one has separated
them from heaven, nor from that earth which is all filled with the presence of Him who
knows whence He will raise again what He created. It is said, indeed, in the Psalm: “The
dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the
flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water round
about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.”64 But this was said rather to exhibit
the cruelty of those who did these things, than the misery of those who suffered them. To
the eyes of men this appears a harsh and doleful lot, yet “precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of His saints.”65 Wherefore all these last offices and ceremonies that concern
the dead, the careful funeral arrangements, and the equipment of the tomb, and the pomp
of obsequies, are rather the solace of the living than the comfort of the dead. If a costly
burial does any good to a wicked man, a squalid burial, or none at all, may harm the godly.
His crowd of domestics furnished the purple-clad Dives with a funeral gorgeous in the eye
of man; but in the sight of God that was a more sumptuous funeral which the ulcerous
pauper received at the hands of the angels, who did not carry him out to a marble tomb,
but bore him aloft to Abraham’s bosom.</p>

<p>The men against whom I have undertaken to defend the city of God laugh at all this.
But even their own philosophers66 have despised a careful burial; and often whole armies
have fought and fallen for their earthly country without caring to inquire whether they
would be left exposed on the field of battle, or become the food of wild beasts. Of this noble
disregard of sepulture poetry has well said: “He who has no tomb has the sky for his vault.”67
How much less ought they to insult over the unburied bodies of Christians, to whom it has
been promised that the flesh itself shall be restored, and the body formed anew, all the
members of it being gathered not only from the earth, but from the most secret recesses of
any other of the elements in which the dead bodies of men have lain hid!</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Reasons for Burying the Bodies of the Saints.</head>
<p>Nevertheless the bodies of the dead are not on this account to be despised and left unburied;
least of all the bodies of the righteous and faithful, which have been used by the Holy
Spirit as His organs and instruments for all good works. For if the dress of a father, or his
ring, or anything he wore, be precious to his children, in proportion to the love they bore
him, with how much more reason ought we to care for the bodies of those we love, which
they wore far more closely and intimately than any clothing! For the body is not an extraneous
ornament or aid, but a part of man’s very nature. And therefore to the righteous
of ancient times the last offices were piously rendered, and sepulchres provided for them,
and obsequies celebrated;68 and they themselves, while yet alive, gave commandment to
their sons about the burial, and, on occasion, even about the removal of their bodies to some
favorite place.69 And Tobit, according to the angel’s testimony, is commended, and is said
to have pleased God by burying the dead.70 Our Lord Himself, too, though He was to rise
again the third day, applauds, and commends to our applause, the good work of the religious
woman who poured precious ointment over His limbs, and did it against His burial.71 And
the Gospel speaks with commendation of those who were careful to take down His body
from the cross, and wrap it lovingly in costly cerements, and see to its burial.72 These instances
certainly do not prove that corpses have any feeling; but they show that God’s
providence extends even to the bodies of the dead, and that such pious offices are pleasing
to Him, as cherishing faith in the resurrection. And we may also draw from them this
wholesome lesson, that if God does not forget even any kind office which loving care pays
to the unconscious dead, much more does He reward the charity we exercise towards the
living. Other things, indeed, which the holy patriarchs said of the burial and removal of
their bodies, they meant to be taken in a prophetic sense; but of these we need not here
speak at large, what we have already said being sufficient. But if the want of those things
which are necessary for the support of the living, as food and clothing, though painful and
trying, does not break down the fortitude and virtuous endurance of good men, nor eradicate
piety from their souls, but rather renders it more fruitful, how much less can the absence
of the funeral, and of the other customary attentions paid to the dead, render those wretched
who are already reposing in the hidden abodes of the blessed! Consequently, though in the
sack of Rome and of other towns the dead bodies of the Christians were deprived of these

<p>But, say they, many Christians were even led away captive. This indeed were a most
pitiable fate, if they could be led away to any place where they could not find their God.
But for this calamity also sacred Scripture affords great consolation. The three youths73
were captives; Daniel was a captive; so were other prophets: and God, the comforter, did
not fail them. And in like manner He has not failed His own people in the power of a nation
which, though barbarous, is yet human,—He who did not abandon the prophet74 in the
belly of a monster. These things, indeed, are turned to ridicule rather than credited by those
with whom we are debating; though they believe what they read in their own books, that
Arion of Methymna, the famous lyrist,75 when he was thrown overboard, was received on
a dolphin’s back and carried to land. But that story of ours about the prophet Jonah is far

<head>Chapter 15.—Of Regulus, in Whom We Have an Example of the Voluntary Endurance
of Captivity for the Sake of Religion; Which Yet Did Not Profit Him, Though
He Was a Worshipper of the Gods.</head>
<p>But among their own famous men they have a very noble example of the voluntary
endurance of captivity in obedience to a religious scruple. Marcus Attilius Regulus, a Roman
general, was a prisoner in the hands of the Carthaginians. But they, being more anxious to
exchange their prisoners with the Romans than to keep them, sent Regulus as a special envoy
with their own embassadors to negotiate this exchange, but bound him first with an oath,
that if he failed to accomplish their wish, he would return to Carthage. He went and persuaded
the senate to the opposite course, because he believed it was not for the advantage
of the Roman republic to make an exchange of prisoners. After he had thus exerted his influence,
the Romans did not compel him to return to the enemy; but what he had sworn he
voluntarily performed. But the Carthaginians put him to death with refined, elaborate, and
horrible tortures. They shut him up in a narrow box, in which he was compelled to stand,
and in which finely sharpened nails were fixed all round about him, so that he could not
lean upon any part of it without intense pain; and so they killed him by depriving him of
sleep.76 With justice, indeed, do they applaud the virtue which rose superior to so frightful
a fate. However, the gods he swore by were those who are now supposed to avenge the
prohibition of their worship, by inflicting these present calamities on the human race. But
if these gods, who were worshipped specially in this behalf, that they might confer happiness
in this life, either willed or permitted these punishments to be inflicted on one who kept his
oath to them, what more cruel punishment could they in their anger have inflicted on a
perjured person? But why may I not draw from my reasoning a double inference? Regulus
certainly had such reverence for the gods, that for his oath’s sake he would neither remain
in his own land nor go elsewhere, but without hesitation returned to his bitterest enemies.
If he thought that this course would be advantageous with respect to this present life, he
was certainly much deceived, for it brought his life to a frightful termination. By his own
example, in fact, he taught that the gods do not secure the temporal happiness of their
worshippers; since he himself, who was devoted to their worship, as both conquered in
battle and taken prisoner, and then, because he refused to act in violation of the oath he had
sworn by them, was tortured and put to death by a new, and hitherto unheard of, and all
too horrible kind of punishment. And on the supposition that the worshippers of the gods
are rewarded by felicity in the life to come, why, then, do they calumniate the influence of
Christianity? why do they assert that this disaster has overtaken the city because it has ceased
to worship its gods, since, worship them as assiduously as it may, it may yet be as unfortunate
<note type="footnote">76 Augustin here uses the words of Cicero (“vigilando peremerunt”), who refers to Regulus, in Pisonem. c 19.
Aulus Gellius, quoting Tubero and Tuditanus (vi. 4), adds some further particulars regarding these tortures.</note>

<pb n="43"/>
as Regulus was? Or will some one carry so wonderful a blindness to the extent of wildly
attempting, in the face of the evident truth, to contend that though one man might be unfortunate,
though a worshipper of the gods, yet a whole city could not be so? That is to say,
the power of their gods is better adapted to preserve multitudes than individuals,—as if a
multitude were not composed of individuals.</p>
<p>But if they say that M. Regulus, even while a prisoner and enduring these bodily torments,
might yet enjoy the blessedness of a virtuous soul,77 then let them recognize that true virtue
by which a city also may be blessed. For the blessedness of a community and of an individual
flow from the same source; for a community is nothing else than a harmonious collection
of individuals. So that I am not concerned meantime to discuss what kind of virtue Regulus
possessed; enough, that by his very noble example they are forced to own that the gods are
to be worshipped not for the sake of bodily comforts or external advantages; for he preferred
to lose all such things rather than offend the gods by whom he had sworn. But what can
we make of men who glory in having such a citizen, but dread having a city like him? If
they do not dread this, then let them acknowledge that some such calamity as befell Regulus
may also befall a community, though they be worshipping their gods as diligently as he; and
let them no longer throw the blame of their misfortunes on Christianity. But as our present
concern is with those Christians who were taken prisoners, let those who take occasion from
this calamity to revile our most wholesome religion in a fashion not less imprudent than
impudent, consider this and hold their peace; for if it was no reproach to their gods that a
most punctilious worshipper of theirs should, for the sake of keeping his oath to them, be
deprived of his native land without hope of finding another, and fall into the hands of his
enemies, and be put to death by a long-drawn and exquisite torture, much less ought the
Christian name to be charged with the captivity of those who believe in its power, since
they, in confident expectation of a heavenly country, know that they are pilgrims even in
their own homes.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Of the Violation of the Consecrated and Other Christian Virgins, to
Which They Were Subjected in Captivity and to Which Their Own Will Gave
No Consent; And Whether This Contaminated Their Souls.</head>
<p>But they fancy they bring a conclusive charge against Christianity, when they aggravate
the horror of captivity by adding that not only wives and unmarried maidens, but even
consecrated virgins, were violated. But truly, with respect to this, it is not Christian faith,
nor piety, nor even the virtue of chastity, which is hemmed into any difficulty; the only difficulty
is so to treat the subject as to satisfy at once modesty and reason. And in discussing
it we shall not be so careful to reply to our accusers as to comfort our friends. Let this,
therefore, in the first place, be laid down as an unassailable position, that the virtue which
makes the life good has its throne in the soul, and thence rules the members of the body,
which becomes holy in virtue of the holiness of the will; and that while the will remains firm
and unshaken, nothing that another person does with the body, or upon the body, is any
fault of the person who suffers it, so long as he cannot escape it without sin. But as not only
pain may be inflicted, but lust gratified on the body of another, whenever anything of this
latter kind takes place, shame invades even a thoroughly pure spirit from which modesty
has not departed,—shame, lest that act which could not be suffered without some sensual
pleasure, should be believed to have been committed also with some assent of the will.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Of Suicide Committed Through Fear of Punishment or Dishonor.</head>
<p>And consequently, even if some of these virgins killed themselves to avoid such disgrace,
who that has any human feeling would refuse to forgive them? And as for those who would
not put an end to their lives, lest they might seem to escape the crime of another by a sin of
their own, he who lays this to their charge as a great wickedness is himself not guiltless of
the fault of folly. For if it is not lawful to take the law into our own hands, and slay even a
guilty person, whose death no public sentence has warranted, then certainly he who kills
himself is a homicide, and so much the guiltier of his own death, as he was more innocent
of that offence for which he doomed himself to die. Do we justly execrate the deed of Judas,
and does truth itself pronounce that by hanging himself he rather aggravated than expiated
the guilt of that most iniquitous betrayal, since, by despairing of God’s mercy in his sorrow
that wrought death, he left to himself no place for a healing penitence? How much more
ought he to abstain from laying violent hands on himself who has done nothing worthy of
such a punishment! For Judas, when he killed himself, killed a wicked man; but he passed
from this life chargeable not only with the death of Christ, but with his own: for though he
killed himself on account of his crime, his killing himself was another crime. Why, then,
should a man who has done no ill do ill to himself, and by killing himself kill the innocent
to escape another’s guilty act, and perpetrate upon himself a sin of his own, that the sin of
another may not be perpetrated on him?</p>

<pb n="46"/>
<head>Chapter 18.—Of the Violence Which May Be Done to the Body by Another’s Lust,
While the Mind Remains Inviolate.</head>
<p>But is there a fear that even another’s lust may pollute the violated? It will not pollute,
if it be another’s: if it pollute, it is not another’s, but is shared also by the polluted. But since
purity is a virtue of the soul, and has for its companion virtue, the fortitude which will rather
endure all ills than consent to evil; and since no one, however magnanimous and pure, has
always the disposal of his own body, but can control only the consent and refusal of his will,
what sane man can suppose that, if his body be seized and forcibly made use of to satisfy
the lust of another, he thereby loses his purity? For if purity can be thus destroyed, then
assuredly purity is no virtue of the soul; nor can it be numbered among those good things
by which the life is made good, but among the good things of the body, in the same category
as strength, beauty, sound and unbroken health, and, in short, all such good things as may
be diminished without at all diminishing the goodness and rectitude of our life. But if
purity be nothing better than these, why should the body be perilled that it may be preserved?
If, on the other hand, it belongs to the soul, then not even when the body is violated is it
lost. Nay more, the virtue of holy continence, when it resists the uncleanness of carnal lust,
sanctifies even the body, and therefore when this continence remains unsubdued, even the
sanctity of the body is preserved, because the will to use it holily remains, and, so far as lies
in the body itself, the power also.</p>
<p>For the sanctity of the body does not consist in the integrity of its members, nor in their
exemption from all touch; for they are exposed to various accidents which do violence to
and wound them, and the surgeons who administer relief often perform operations that
sicken the spectator. A midwife, suppose, has (whether maliciously or accidentally, or
through unskillfulness) destroyed the virginity of some girl, while endeavoring to ascertain
it: I suppose no one is so foolish as to believe that, by this destruction of the integrity of one
organ, the virgin has lost anything even of her bodily sanctity. And thus, so long as the soul
keeps this firmness of purpose which sanctifies even the body, the violence done by another’s
lust makes no impression on this bodily sanctity, which is preserved intact by one’s own
persistent continence. Suppose a virgin violates the oath she has sworn to God, and goes
to meet her seducer with the intention of yielding to him, shall we say that as she goes she
is possessed even of bodily sanctity, when already she has lost and destroyed that sanctity
of soul which sanctifies the body? Far be it from us to so misapply words. Let us rather
draw this conclusion, that while the sanctity of the soul remains even when the body is violated,
the sanctity of the body is not lost; and that, in like manner, the sanctity of the body
is lost when the sanctity of the soul is violated, though the body itself remains intact. And
therefore a woman who has been violated by the sin of another, and without any consent
of her own, has no cause to put herself to death; much less has she cause to commit suicide

<pb n="47"/>
in order to avoid such violation, for in that case she commits certain homicide to prevent
a crime which is uncertain as yet, and not her own.</p>

<pb n="48"/>
<head>Chapter 19.—Of Lucretia, Who Put an End to Her Life Because of the Outrage Done
Her.</head>
<p>This, then, is our position, and it seems sufficiently lucid. We maintain that when a
woman is violated while her soul admits no consent to the iniquity, but remains inviolably
chaste, the sin is not hers, but his who violates her. But do they against whom we have to
defend not only the souls, but the sacred bodies too of these outraged Christian captives,—do
they, perhaps, dare to dispute our position? But all know how loudly they extol the purity
of Lucretia, that noble matron of ancient Rome. When King Tarquin’s son had violated
her body, she made known the wickedness of this young profligate to her husband Collatinus,
and to Brutus her kinsman, men of high rank and full of courage, and bound them by an
oath to avenge it. Then, heart-sick, and unable to bear the shame, she put an end to her
life. What shall we call her? An adulteress, or chaste? There is no question which she was.
Not more happily than truly did a declaimer say of this sad occurrence: “Here was a marvel:
there were two, and only one committed adultery.” Most forcibly and truly spoken. For
this declaimer, seeing in the union of the two bodies the foul lust of the one, and the chaste
will of the other, and giving heed not to the contact of the bodily members, but to the wide
diversity of their souls, says: “There were two, but the adultery was committed only by one.”</p>
<p>But how is it, that she who was no partner to the crime bears the heavier punishment
of the two? For the adulterer was only banished along with his father; she suffered the extreme
penalty. If that was not impurity by which she was unwillingly ravished, then this is
not justice by which she, being chaste, is punished. To you I appeal, ye laws and judges of
Rome. Even after the perpetration of great enormities, you do not suffer the criminal to be
slain untried. If, then, one were to bring to your bar this case, and were to prove to you that
a woman not only untried, but chaste and innocent, had been killed, would you not visit
the murderer with punishment proportionably severe? This crime was committed by Lucretia;
that Lucretia so celebrated and lauded slew the innocent, chaste, outraged Lucretia.
Pronounce sentence. But if you cannot, because there does not appear any one whom you
can punish, why do you extol with such unmeasured laudation her who slew an innocent
and chaste woman? Assuredly you will find it impossible to defend her before the judges
of the realms below, if they be such as your poets are fond of representing them; for she is
among those
<lg>
<l>“Who guiltless sent themselves to doom,</l>
<l>And all for loathing of the day,</l>
<l>In madness threw their lives away.”</l>
<l>And if she with the others wishes to return,</l>
<l>“Fate bars the way: around their keep</l>
</lg>
<pb n="49"/>
<lg>
<l>The slow unlovely waters creep,</l>
<l>And bind with ninefold chain.”78</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Or perhaps she is not there, because she slew herself conscious of guilt, not of innocence?
She herself alone knows her reason; but what if she was betrayed by the pleasure of the act,
and gave some consent to Sextus, though so violently abusing her, and then was so affected
with remorse, that she thought death alone could expiate her sin? Even though this were
the case, she ought still to have held her hand from suicide, if she could with her false gods
have accomplished a fruitful repentance. However, if such were the state of the case, and
if it were false that there were two, but one only committed adultery; if the truth were that
both were involved in it, one by open assault, the other by secret consent, then she did not
kill an innocent woman; and therefore her erudite defenders may maintain that she is not
among that class of the dwellers below “who guiltless sent themselves to doom.” But this
case of Lucretia is in such a dilemma, that if you extenuate the homicide, you confirm the
adultery: if you acquit her of adultery, you make the charge of homicide heavier; and there
is no way out of the dilemma, when one asks, If she was adulterous, why praise her? if chaste,
why slay her?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for our purpose of refuting those who are unable to comprehend what
true sanctity is, and who therefore insult over our outraged Christian women, it is enough
that in the instance of this noble Roman matron it was said in her praise, “There were two,
but the adultery was the crime of only one.” For Lucretia was confidently believed to be
superior to the contamination of any consenting thought to the adultery. And accordingly,
since she killed herself for being subjected to an outrage in which she had no guilty part, it
is obvious that this act of hers was prompted not by the love of purity, but by the overwhelming
burden of her shame. She was ashamed that so foul a crime had been perpetrated upon
her, though without her abetting; and this matron, with the Roman love of glory in her
veins, was seized with a proud dread that, if she continued to live, it would be supposed she
willingly did not resent the wrong that had been done her. She could not exhibit to men
her conscience but she judged that her self-inflicted punishment would testify her state of
mind; and she burned with shame at the thought that her patient endurance of the foul affront
that another had done her, should be construed into complicity with him. Not such was
the decision of the Christian women who suffered as she did, and yet survive. They declined
to avenge upon themselves the guilt of others, and so add crimes of their own to those crimes
in which they had no share. For this they would have done had their shame driven them
to homicide, as the lust of their enemies had driven them to adultery. Within their own
souls, in the witness of their own conscience, they enjoy the glory of chastity. In the sight
of God, too, they are esteemed pure, and this contents them; they ask no more: it suffices
<note type="footnote">78 Virgil, Æneid, vi. 434.</note>

them to have opportunity of doing good, and they decline to evade the distress of human
suspicion, lest they thereby deviate from the divine law.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—That Christians Have No Authority for Committing Suicide in Any
Circumstances Whatever.</head>
<p>It is not without significance, that in no passage of the holy canonical books there can
be found either divine precept or permission to take away our own life, whether for the sake
of entering on the enjoyment of immortality, or of shunning, or ridding ourselves of anything
whatever. Nay, the law, rightly interpreted, even prohibits suicide, where it says, “Thou
shalt not kill.” This is proved especially by the omission of the words “thy neighbor,” which
are inserted when false witness is forbidden: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor.” Nor yet should any one on this account suppose he has not broken this commandment
if he has borne false witness only against himself. For the love of our neighbor
is regulated by the love of ourselves, as it is written, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
If, then, he who makes false statements about himself is not less guilty of bearing false witness
than if he had made them to the injury of his neighbor; although in the commandment
prohibiting false witness only his neighbor is mentioned, and persons taking no pains to
understand it might suppose that a man was allowed to be a false witness to his own hurt;
how much greater reason have we to understand that a man may not kill himself, since in
the commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” there is no limitation added nor any exception
made in favor of any one, and least of all in favor of him on whom the command is laid!
And so some attempt to extend this command even to beasts and cattle, as if it forbade us
to take life from any creature. But if so, why not extend it also to the plants, and all that is
rooted in and nourished by the earth? For though this class of creatures have no sensation,
yet they also are said to live, and consequently they can die; and therefore, if violence be
done them, can be killed. So, too, the apostle, when speaking of the seeds of such things as
these, says, “That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die;” and in the Psalm it is
said, “He killed their vines with hail.” Must we therefore reckon it a breaking of this commandment,
“Thou shalt not kill,” to pull a flower? Are we thus insanely to countenance the
foolish error of the Manichæans? Putting aside, then, these ravings, if, when we say, Thou
shalt not kill, we do not understand this of the plants, since they have no sensation, nor of
the irrational animals that fly, swim, walk, or creep, since they are dissociated from us by
their want of reason, and are therefore by the just appointment of the Creator subjected to
us to kill or keep alive for our own uses; if so, then it remains that we understand that
commandment simply of man. The commandment is, “Thou shall not kill man;” therefore
neither another nor yourself, for he who kills himself still kills nothing else than man.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Of the Cases in Which We May Put Men to Death Without Incurring
the Guilt of Murder.</head>
<p>However, there are some exceptions made by the divine authority to its own law, that
men may not be put to death. These exceptions are of two kinds, being justified either by
a general law, or by a special commission granted for a time to some individual. And in
this latter case, he to whom authority is delegated, and who is but the sword in the hand of
him who uses it, is not himself responsible for the death he deals. And, accordingly, they
who have waged war in obedience to the divine command, or in conformity with His laws,
have represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom of government, and in
this capacity have put to death wicked men; such persons have by no means violated the
commandment, “Thou shalt not kill.” Abraham indeed was not merely deemed guiltless
of cruelty, but was even applauded for his piety, because he was ready to slay his son in
obedience to God, not to his own passion. And it is reasonably enough made a question,
whether we are to esteem it to have been in compliance with a command of God that Jephthah
killed his daughter, because she met him when he had vowed that he would sacrifice to God
whatever first met him as he returned victorious from battle. Samson, too, who drew down
the house on himself and his foes together, is justified only on this ground, that the Spirit
who wrought wonders by him had given him secret instructions to do this. With the exception,
then, of these two classes of cases, which are justified either by a just law that applies
generally, or by a special intimation from God Himself, the fountain of all justice, whoever
kills a man, either himself or another, is implicated in the guilt of murder.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—That Suicide Can Never Be Prompted by Magnanimity.</head>
<p>But they who have laid violent hands on themselves are perhaps to be admired for their
greatness of soul, though they cannot be applauded for the soundness of their judgment.
However, if you look at the matter more closely, you will scarcely call it greatness of soul,
which prompts a man to kill himself rather than bear up against some hardships of fortune,
or sins in which he is not implicated. Is it not rather proof of a feeble mind, to be unable
to bear either the pains of bodily servitude or the foolish opinion of the vulgar? And is not
that to be pronounced the greater mind, which rather faces than flees the ills of life, and
which, in comparison of the light and purity of conscience, holds in small esteem the judgment
of men, and specially of the vulgar, which is frequently involved in a mist of error?
And, therefore, if suicide is to be esteemed a magnanimous act, none can take higher rank
for magnanimity than that Cleombrotus, who (as the story goes), when he had read Plato’s
book in which he treats of the immortality of the soul, threw himself from a wall, and so
passed from this life to that which he believed to be better. For he was not hard pressed by
calamity, nor by any accusation, false or true, which he could not very well have lived down;
there was, in short, no motive but only magnanimity urging him to seek death, and break
away from the sweet detention of this life. And yet that this was a magnanimous rather
than a justifiable action, Plato himself, whom he had read, would have told him; for he would
certainly have been forward to commit, or at least to recommend suicide, had not the same
bright intellect which saw that the soul was immortal, discerned also that to seek immortality
by suicide was to be prohibited rather than encouraged.</p>
<p>Again, it is said many have killed themselves to prevent an enemy doing so. But we are
not inquiring whether it has been done, but whether it ought to have been done. Sound
judgment is to be preferred even to examples, and indeed examples harmonize with the
voice of reason; but not all examples, but those only which are distinguished by their piety,
and are proportionately worthy of imitation. For suicide we cannot cite the example of
patriarchs, prophets, or apostles; though our Lord Jesus Christ, when He admonished them
to flee from city to city if they were persecuted, might very well have taken that occasion to
advise them to lay violent hands on themselves, and so escape their persecutors. But seeing
He did not do this, nor proposed this mode of departing this life, though He were addressing
His own friends for whom He had promised to prepare everlasting mansions, it is obvious
that such examples as are produced from the “nations that forget God,” give no warrant of
imitation to the worshippers of the one true God.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—What We are to Think of the Example of Cato, Who Slew Himself
Because Unable to Endure Cæsar’s Victory.</head>
<p>Besides Lucretia, of whom enough has already been said, our advocates of suicide have
some difficulty in finding any other prescriptive example, unless it be that of Cato, who
killed himself at Utica. His example is appealed to, not because he was the only man who
did so, but because he was so esteemed as a learned and excellent man, that it could plausibly
be maintained that what he did was and is a good thing to do. But of this action of his, what
can I say but that his own friends, enlightened men as he, prudently dissuaded him, and
therefore judged his act to be that of a feeble rather than a strong spirit, and dictated not by
honorable feeling forestalling shame, but by weakness shrinking from hardships? Indeed,
Cato condemns himself by the advice he gave to his dearly loved son. For if it was a disgrace
to live under Cæsar’s rule, why did the father urge the son to this disgrace, by encouraging
him to trust absolutely to Cæsar’s generosity? Why did he not persuade him to die along
with himself? If Torquatus was applauded for putting his son to death, when contrary to
orders he had engaged, and engaged successfully, with the enemy, why did conquered Cato
spare his conquered son, though he did not spare himself? Was it more disgraceful to be a
victor contrary to orders, than to submit to a victor contrary to the received ideas of honor?
Cato, then, cannot have deemed it to be shameful to live under Cæsar’s rule; for had he done
so, the father’s sword would have delivered his son from this disgrace. The truth is, that his
son, whom he both hoped and desired would be spared by Cæsar, was not more loved by
him than Cæsar was envied the glory of pardoning him (as indeed Cæsar himself is reported
to have said79); or if envy is too strong a word, let us say he was ashamed that this glory
should be his.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—That in that Virtue in Which Regulus Excels Cato, Christians are Pre-
Eminently Distinguished.</head>
<p>Our opponents are offended at our preferring to Cato the saintly Job, who endured
dreadful evils in his body rather than deliver himself from all torment by self-inflicted death;
or other saints, of whom it is recorded in our authoritative and trustworthy books that they
bore captivity and the oppression of their enemies rather than commit suicide. But their
own books authorize us to prefer to Marcus Cato, Marcus Regulus. For Cato had never
conquered Cæsar; and when conquered by him, disdained to submit himself to him, and
that he might escape this submission put himself to death. Regulus, on the contrary, had
formerly conquered the Carthaginians, and in command of the army of Rome had won for
the Roman republic a victory which no citizen could bewail, and which the enemy himself
was constrained to admire; yet afterwards, when he in his turn was defeated by them, he
preferred to be their captive rather than to put himself beyond their reach by suicide. Patient
under the domination of the Carthaginians, and constant in his love of the Romans, he
neither deprived the one of his conquered body, nor the other of his unconquered spirit.
Neither was it love of life that prevented him from killing himself. This was plainly enough
indicated by his unhesitatingly returning, on account of his promise and oath, to the same
enemies whom he had more grievously provoked by his words in the senate than even by
his arms in battle. Having such a contempt of life, and preferring to end it by whatever
torments excited enemies might contrive, rather than terminate it by his own hand, he could
not more distinctly have declared how great a crime he judged suicide to be. Among all
their famous and remarkable citizens, the Romans have no better man to boast of than this,
who was neither corrupted by prosperity, for he remained a very poor man after winning
such victories; nor broken by adversity, for he returned intrepidly to the most miserable
end. But if the bravest and most renowned heroes, who had but an earthly country to defend,
and who, though they had but false gods, yet rendered them a true worship, and carefully
kept their oath to them; if these men, who by the custom and right of war put conquered
enemies to the sword, yet shrank from putting an end to their own lives even when conquered
by their enemies; if, though they had no fear at all of death, they would yet rather suffer
slavery than commit suicide, how much rather must Christians, the worshippers of the true
God, the aspirants to a heavenly citizenship, shrink from this act, if in God’s providence
they have been for a season delivered into the hands of their enemies to prove or to correct
them! And certainly, Christians subjected to this humiliating condition will not be deserted
by the Most High, who for their sakes humbled Himself. Neither should they forget that
they are bound by no laws of war, nor military orders, to put even a conquered enemy to
the sword; and if a man may not put to death the enemy who has sinned, or may yet sin
against him, who is so infatuated as to maintain that he may kill himself because an enemy
has sinned, or is going to sin, against him?</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—That We Should Not Endeavor By Sin to Obviate Sin.</head>
<p>But, we are told, there is ground to fear that, when the body is subjected to the enemy’s
lust, the insidious pleasure of sense may entice the soul to consent to the sin, and steps must
be taken to prevent so disastrous a result. And is not suicide the proper mode of preventing
not only the enemy’s sin, but the sin of the Christian so allured? Now, in the first place, the
soul which is led by God and His wisdom, rather than by bodily concupiscence, will certainly
never consent to the desire aroused in its own flesh by another’s lust. And, at all events, if
it be true, as the truth plainly declares, that suicide is a detestable and damnable wickedness,
who is such a fool as to say, Let us sin now, that we may obviate a possible future sin; let us
now commit murder, lest we perhaps afterwards should commit adultery? If we are so
controlled by iniquity that innocence is out of the question, and we can at best but make a
choice of sins, is not a future and uncertain adultery preferable to a present and certain
murder? Is it not better to commit a wickedness which penitence may heal, than a crime
which leaves no place for healing contrition? I say this for the sake of those men or women
who fear they may be enticed into consenting to their violator’s lust, and think they should
lay violent hands on themselves, and so prevent, not another’s sin, but their own. But far
be it from the mind of a Christian confiding in God, and resting in the hope of His aid; far
be it, I say, from such a mind to yield a shameful consent to pleasures of the flesh, howsoever
presented. And if that lustful disobedience, which still dwells in our mortal members, follows
its own law irrespective of our will, surely its motions in the body of one who rebels against
them are as blameless as its motions in the body of one who sleeps.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—That in Certain Peculiar Cases the Examples of the Saints are Not to
Be Followed.</head>
<p>But, they say, in the time of persecution some holy women escaped those who menaced
them with outrage, by casting themselves into rivers which they knew would drown them;
and having died in this manner, they are venerated in the church catholic as martyrs. Of
such persons I do not presume to speak rashly. I cannot tell whether there may not have
been vouchsafed to the church some divine authority, proved by trustworthy evidences, for
so honoring their memory: it may be that it is so. It may be they were not deceived by human
judgment, but prompted by divine wisdom, to their act of self-destruction. We know that
this was the case with Samson. And when God enjoins any act, and intimates by plain
evidence that He has enjoined it, who will call obedience criminal? Who will accuse so religious
a submission? But then every man is not justified in sacrificing his son to God, because
Abraham was commendable in so doing. The soldier who has slain a man in obedience to
the authority under which he is lawfully commissioned, is not accused of murder by any
law of his state; nay, if he has not slain him, it is then he is accused of treason to the state,
and of despising the law. But if he has been acting on his own authority, and at his own
impulse, he has in this case incurred the crime of shedding human blood. And thus he is
punished for doing without orders the very thing he is punished for neglecting to do when
he has been ordered. If the commands of a general make so great a difference, shall the
commands of God make none? He, then, who knows it is unlawful to kill himself, may
nevertheless do so if he is ordered by Him whose commands we may not neglect. Only let
him be very sure that the divine command has been signified. As for us, we can become
privy to the secrets of conscience only in so far as these are disclosed to us, and so far only
do we judge: “No one knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.”80
But this we affirm, this we maintain, this we every way pronounce to be right, that no man
ought to inflict on himself voluntary death, for this is to escape the ills of time by plunging
into those of eternity; that no man ought to do so on account of another man’s sins, for this
were to escape a guilt which could not pollute him, by incurring great guilt of his own; that
no man ought to do so on account of his own past sins, for he has all the more need of this
life that these sins may be healed by repentance; that no man should put an end to this life
to obtain that better life we look for after death, for those who die by their own hand have
no better life after death.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Whether Voluntary Death Should Be Sought in Order to Avoid Sin.</head>
<p>There remains one reason for suicide which I mentioned before, and which is thought
a sound one,—namely, to prevent one’s falling into sin either through the blandishments
of pleasure or the violence of pain. If this reason were a good one, then we should be impelled
to exhort men at once to destroy themselves, as soon as they have been washed in the laver
of regeneration, and have received the forgiveness of all sin. Then is the time to escape all
future sin, when all past sin is blotted out. And if this escape be lawfully secured by suicide,
why not then specially? Why does any baptized person hold his hand from taking his own
life? Why does any person who is freed from the hazards of this life again expose himself
to them, when he has power so easily to rid himself of them all, and when it is written, “He
who loveth danger shall fall into it?”81 Why does he love, or at least face, so many serious
dangers, by remaining in this life from which he may legitimately depart? But is any one
so blinded and twisted in his moral nature, and so far astray from the truth, as to think that,
though a man ought to make away with himself for fear of being led into sin by the oppression
of one man, his master, he ought yet to live, and so expose himself to the hourly temptations
of this world, both to all those evils which the oppression of one master involves, and to
numberless other miseries in which this life inevitably implicates us? What reason, then,
is there for our consuming time in those exhortations by which we seek to animate the
baptized, either to virginal chastity, or vidual continence, or matrimonial fidelity, when we
have so much more simple and compendious a method of deliverance from sin, by persuading
those who are fresh from baptism to put an end to their lives, and so pass to their Lord pure
and well-conditioned? If any one thinks that such persuasion should be attempted, I say
not he is foolish, but mad. With what face, then, can he say to any man, “Kill yourself, lest
to your small sins you add a heinous sin, while you live under an unchaste master, whose
conduct is that of a barbarian?” How can he say this, if he cannot without wickedness say,
“Kill yourself, now that you are washed from all your sins, lest you fall again into similar or
even aggravated sins, while you live in a world which has such power to allure by its unclean
pleasures, to torment by its horrible cruelties, to overcome by its errors and terrors?” It is
wicked to say this; it is therefore wicked to kill oneself. For if there could be any just cause
of suicide, this were so. And since not even this is so, there is none.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—By What Judgment of God the Enemy Was Permitted to Indulge His
Lust on the Bodies of Continent Christians.</head>
<p>Let not your life, then, be a burden to you, ye faithful servants of Christ, though your
chastity was made the sport of your enemies. You have a grand and true consolation, if you
maintain a good conscience, and know that you did not consent to the sins of those who
were permitted to commit sinful outrage upon you. And if you should ask why this permission
was granted, indeed it is a deep providence of the Creator and Governor of the world;
and “unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out.”82 Nevertheless,
faithfully interrogate your own souls, whether ye have not been unduly puffed up by your
integrity, and continence, and chastity; and whether ye have not been so desirous of the
human praise that is accorded to these virtues, that ye have envied some who possessed
them. I, for my part, do not know your hearts, and therefore I make no accusation; I do not
even hear what your hearts answer when you question them. And yet, if they answer that
it is as I have supposed it might be, do not marvel that you have lost that by which you can
win men’s praise, and retain that which cannot be exhibited to men. If you did not consent
to sin, it was because God added His aid to His grace that it might not be lost, and because
shame before men succeeded to human glory that it might not be loved. But in both respects
even the faint-hearted among you have a consolation, approved by the one experience,
chastened by the other; justified by the one, corrected by the other. As to those whose hearts,
when interrogated, reply that they have never been proud of the virtue of virginity, widowhood,
or matrimonial chastity, but, condescending to those of low estate, rejoiced with
trembling in these gifts of God, and that they have never envied any one the like excellences
of sanctity and purity, but rose superior to human applause, which is wont to be abundant
in proportion to the rarity of the virtue applauded, and rather desired that their own number
be increased, than that by the smallness of their numbers each of them should be conspicuous;—
even such faithful women, I say, must not complain that permission was given to the
barbarians so grossly to outrage them; nor must they allow themselves to believe that God
overlooked their character when He permitted acts which no one with impunity commits.
For some most flagrant and wicked desires are allowed free play at present by the secret
judgment of God, and are reserved to the public and final judgment. Moreover, it is possible
that those Christian women, who are unconscious of any undue pride on account of their
virtuous chastity, whereby they sinlessly suffered the violence of their captors, had yet some
lurking infirmity which might have betrayed them into a proud and contemptuous bearing,
had they not been subjected to the humiliation that befell them in the taking of the city. As,
therefore, some men were removed by death, that no wickedness might change their disposition,
so these women were outraged lest prosperity should corrupt their modesty. Neither
<note type="footnote">82 Rom. xi. 33.</note>

<pb n="60"/>
those women then, who were already puffed up by the circumstance that they were still
virgins, nor those who might have been so puffed up had they not been exposed to the violence
of the enemy, lost their chastity, but rather gained humility; the former were saved
from pride already cherished, the latter from pride that would shortly have grown upon
them.</p>
<p>We must further notice that some of those sufferers may have conceived that continence
is a bodily good, and abides so long as the body is inviolate, and did not understand that
the purity both of the body and the soul rests on the steadfastness of the will strengthened
by God’s grace, and cannot be forcibly taken from an unwilling person. From this error
they are probably now delivered. For when they reflect how conscientiously they served
God, and when they settle again to the firm persuasion that He can in nowise desert those
who so serve Him, and so invoke His aid and when they consider, what they cannot doubt,
how pleasing to Him is chastity, they are shut up to the conclusion that He could never have
permitted these disasters to befall His saints, if by them that saintliness could be destroyed
which He Himself had bestowed upon them, and delights to see in them.</p>

<p>The whole family of God, most high and most true, has therefore a consolation of its
own,—a consolation which cannot deceive, and which has in it a surer hope than the tottering
and falling affairs of earth can afford. They will not refuse the discipline of this temporal
life, in which they are schooled for life eternal; nor will they lament their experience of it,
for the good things of earth they use as pilgrims who are not detained by them, and its ills
either prove or improve them. As for those who insult over them in their trials, and when
ills befall them say, “Where is thy God?”83 we may ask them where their gods are when they
suffer the very calamities for the sake of avoiding which they worship their gods, or maintain
they ought to be worshipped; for the family of Christ is furnished with its reply: our God
is everywhere present, wholly everywhere; not confined to any place. He can be present
unperceived, and be absent without moving; when He exposes us to adversities, it is either
to prove our perfections or correct our imperfections; and in return for our patient endurance
of the sufferings of time, He reserves for us an everlasting reward. But who are you, that
we should deign to speak with you even about your own gods, much less about our God,
who is “to be feared above all gods? For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord
made the heavens.”84</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—That Those Who Complain of Christianity Really Desire to Live
Without Restraint in Shameful Luxury.</head>
<p>If the famous Scipio Nasica were now alive, who was once your pontiff, and was unanimously
chosen by the senate, when, in the panic created by the Punic war, they sought for
the best citizen to entertain the Phrygian goddess, he would curb this shamelessness of yours,
though you would perhaps scarcely dare to look upon the countenance of such a man. For
why in your calamities do you complain of Christianity, unless because you desire to enjoy
your luxurious license unrestrained, and to lead an abandoned and profligate life without
the interruption of any uneasiness or disaster? For certainly your desire for peace, and
prosperity, and plenty is not prompted by any purpose of using these blessings honestly,
that is to say, with moderation, sobriety, temperance, and piety; for your purpose rather is
to run riot in an endless variety of sottish pleasures, and thus to generate from your
prosperity a moral pestilence which will prove a thousandfold more disastrous than the
fiercest enemies. It was such a calamity as this that Scipio, your chief pontiff, your best
man in the judgment of the whole senate, feared when he refused to agree to the destruction
of Carthage, Rome’s rival and opposed Cato, who advised its destruction. He feared security,
that enemy of weak minds, and he perceived that a wholesome fear would be a fit guardian
for the citizens. And he was not mistaken; the event proved how wisely he had spoken. For
when Carthage was destroyed, and the Roman republic delivered from its great cause of
anxiety, a crowd of disastrous evils forthwith resulted from the prosperous condition of
things. First concord was weakened, and destroyed by fierce and bloody seditions; then
followed, by a concatenation of baleful causes, civil wars, which brought in their train such
massacres, such bloodshed, such lawless and cruel proscription and plunder, that those
Romans who, in the days of their virtue, had expected injury only at the hands of their enemies,
now that their virtue was lost, suffered greater cruelties at the hands of their fellowcitizens.
The lust of rule, which with other vices existed among the Romans in more unmitigated
intensity than among any other people, after it had taken possession of the more
powerful few, subdued under its yoke the rest, worn and wearied.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">
<pb n="63"/>
<head>Chapter 31.—By What Steps the Passion for Governing Increased Among the Romans.</head>
<p>For at what stage would that passion rest when once it has lodged in a proud spirit,
until by a succession of advances it has reached even the throne. And to obtain such advances
nothing avails but unscrupulous ambition. But unscrupulous ambition has nothing to work
upon, save in a nation corrupted by avarice and luxury. Moreover, a people becomes avaricious
and luxurious by prosperity; and it was this which that very prudent man Nasica was
endeavouring to avoid when he opposed the destruction of the greatest, strongest, wealthiest
city of Rome’s enemy. He thought that thus fear would act as a curb on lust, and that lust
being curbed would not run riot in luxury, and that luxury being prevented avarice would
be at an end; and that these vices being banished, virtue would flourish and increase the
great profit of the state; and liberty, the fit companion of virtue, would abide unfettered.
For similar reasons, and animated by the same considerate patriotism, that same chief pontiff
of yours—I still refer to him who was adjudged Rome’s best man without one dissentient
voice—threw cold water on the proposal of the senate to build a circle of seats round the
theatre, and in a very weighty speech warned them against allowing the luxurious manners
of Greece to sap the Roman manliness, and persuaded them not to yield to the enervating
and emasculating influence of foreign licentiousness. So authoritative and forcible were his
words, that the senate was moved to prohibit the use even of those benches which hitherto
had been customarily brought to the theatre for the temporary use of the citizens.85 How
eagerly would such a man as this have banished from Rome the scenic exhibitions themselves,
had he dared to oppose the authority of those whom he supposed to be gods! For he did
not know that they were malicious devils; or if he did, he supposed they should rather be
propitiated than despised. For there had not yet been revealed to the Gentiles the heavenly
doctrine which should purify their hearts by faith, and transform their natural disposition
by humble godliness, and turn them from the service of proud devils to seek the things that
are in heaven, or even above the heavens.</p>

you murmur against Him who has freed you from such rulers, that the scenic games, exhibitions
of shameless folly and license, were established at Rome, not by men’s vicious cravings,
but by the appointment of your gods. Much more pardonably might you have rendered
divine honors to Scipio than to such gods as these. The gods were not so moral as their
pontiff. But give me now your attention, if your mind, inebriated by its deep potations of
error, can take in any sober truth. The gods enjoined that games be exhibited in their honor
to stay a physical pestilence; their pontiff prohibited the theatre from being constructed, to
prevent a moral pestilence. If, then, there remains in you sufficient mental enlightenment
to prefer the soul to the body, choose whom you will worship. Besides, though the pestilence
was stayed, this was not because the voluptuous madness of stage-plays had taken possession
of a warlike people hitherto accustomed only to the games of the circus; but these astute
and wicked spirits, foreseeing that in due course the pestilence would shortly cease, took
occasion to infect, not the bodies, but the morals of their worshippers, with a far more serious
disease. And in this pestilence these gods find great enjoyment, because it benighted the
minds of men with so gross a darkness and dishonored them with so foul a deformity, that
even quite recently (will posterity be able to credit it?) some of those who fled from the sack
of Rome and found refuge in Carthage, were so infected with this disease, that day after day
they seemed to contend with one another who should most madly run after the actors in
the theatres.</p>

How is it that while, as we hear, even the eastern nations are bewailing your ruin, and while
powerful states in the most remote parts of the earth are mourning your fall as a public
calamity, ye yourselves should be crowding to the theatres, should be pouring into them
and filling them; and, in short, be playing a madder part now than ever before? This was
the foul plague-spot, this the wreck of virtue and honor that Scipio sought to preserve you
from when he prohibited the construction of theatres; this was his reason for desiring that
you might still have an enemy to fear, seeing as he did how easily prosperity would corrupt
and destroy you. He did not consider that republic flourishing whose walls stand, but whose
morals are in ruins. But the seductions of evil-minded devils had more influence with you
than the precautions of prudent men. Hence the injuries you do, you will not permit to be
imputed to you: but the injuries you suffer, you impute to Christianity. Depraved by good
fortune, and not chastened by adversity, what you desire in the restoration of a peaceful and
secure state, is not the tranquillity of the commonwealth, but the impunity of your own vicious
luxury. Scipio wished you to be hard pressed by an enemy, that you might not abandon
yourselves to luxurious manners; but so abandoned are you, that not even when crushed
by the enemy is your luxury repressed. You have missed the profit of your calamity; you
have been made most wretched, and have remained most profligate.</p>

who shall not eternally dwell in the lot of the saints. Of these, some are not now recognized;
others declare themselves, and do not hesitate to make common cause with our enemies in
murmuring against God, whose sacramental badge they wear. These men you may to-day

we have the less reason to despair of the reclamation even of such persons, if among our
most declared enemies there are now some, unknown to themselves, who are destined to

<p>But I have still some things to say in confutation of those who refer the disasters of the
Roman republic to our religion, because it prohibits the offering of sacrifices to the gods.
For this end I must recount all, or as many as may seem sufficient, of the disasters which
befell that city and its subject provinces, before these sacrifices were prohibited; for all these
disasters they would doubtless have attributed to us, if at that time our religion had shed its
light upon them, and had prohibited their sacrifices. I must then go on to show what social
well-being the true God, in whose hand are all kingdoms, vouchsafed to grant to them that
their empire might increase. I must show why He did so, and how their false gods, instead
of at all aiding them, greatly injured them by guile and deceit. And, lastly, I must meet those
who, when on this point convinced and confuted by irrefragable proofs, endeavor to maintain
that they worship the gods, not hoping for the present advantages of this life, but for those
which are to be enjoyed after death. And this, if I am not mistaken, will be the most difficult
part of my task, and will be worthy of the loftiest argument; for we must then enter the lists
with the philosophers, not the mere common herd of philosophers, but the most renowned,
who in many points agree with ourselves, as regarding the immortality of the soul, and that
the true God created the world, and by His providence rules all He has created. But as they
differ from us on other points, we must not shrink from the task of exposing their errors,
that, having refuted the gainsaying of the wicked with such ability as God may vouchsafe,
we may assert the city of God, and true piety, and the worship of God, to which alone the
promise of true and everlasting felicity is attached. Here, then, let us conclude, that we may

<p>If the feeble mind of man did not presume to resist the clear evidence of truth, but

from God, by its faith and piety, the grace needed to heal it, they who have just ideas, and

of empty conjecture. But this mental infirmity is now more prevalent and hurtful than ever,
to such an extent that even after the truth has been as fully demonstrated as man can prove
it to man, they hold for the very truth their own unreasonable fancies, either on account of
their great blindness, which prevents them from seeing what is plainly set before them, or
on account of their opinionative obstinacy, which prevents them from acknowledging the
force of what they do see. There therefore frequently arises a necessity of speaking more
fully on those points which are already clear, that we may, as it were, present them not to
the eye, but even to the touch, so that they may be felt even by those who close their eyes
against them. And yet to what end shall we ever bring our discussions, or what bounds can
be set to our discourse, if we proceed on the principle that we must always reply to those
who reply to us? For those who are either unable to understand our arguments, or are so
hardened by the habit of contradiction, that though they understand they cannot yield to
them, reply to us, and, as it is written, “speak hard things,”86 and are incorrigibly vain. Now,
if we were to propose to confute their objections as often as they with brazen face chose to
disregard our arguments, and so often as they could by any means contradict our statements,
you see how endless, and fruitless, and painful a task we should be undertaking. And
therefore I do not wish my writings to be judged even by you, my son Marcellinus, nor by
any of those others at whose service this work of mine is freely and in all Christian charity
put, if at least you intend always to require a reply to every exception which you hear taken
to what you read in it; for so you would become like those silly women of whom the apostle
says that they are “always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.”87</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Recapitulation of the Contents of the First Book.</head>
<p>In the foregoing book, having begun to speak of the city of God, to which I have resolved,
Heaven helping me, to consecrate the whole of this work, it was my first endeavor to reply
to those who attribute the wars by which the world is being devastated, and especially the
recent sack of Rome by the barbarians, to the religion of Christ, which prohibits the offering
of abominable sacrifices to devils. I have shown that they ought rather to attribute it to
Christ, that for His name’s sake the barbarians, in contravention of all custom and law of
war, threw open as sanctuaries the largest churches, and in many instances showed such
reverence to Christ, that not only His genuine servants, but even those who in their terror
feigned themselves to be so, were exempted from all those hardships which by the custom
of war may lawfully be inflicted. Then out of this there arose the question, why wicked and
ungrateful men were permitted to share in these benefits; and why, too, the hardships and
calamities of war were inflicted on the godly as well as on the ungodly. And in giving a
suitably full answer to this large question, I occupied some considerable space, partly that
I might relieve the anxieties which disturb many when they observe that the blessings of
God, and the common and daily human casualties, fall to the lot of bad men and good
without distinction; but mainly that I might minister some consolation to those holy and
chaste women who were outraged by the enemy, in such a way as to shock their modesty,
though not to sully their purity, and that I might preserve them from being ashamed of life,
though they have no guilt to be ashamed of. And then I briefly spoke against those who
with a most shameless wantonness insult over those poor Christians who were subjected to
those calamities, and especially over those broken-hearted and humiliated, though chaste
and holy women; these fellows themselves being most depraved and unmanly profligates,
quite degenerate from the genuine Romans, whose famous deeds are abundantly recorded
in history, and everywhere celebrated, but who have found in their descendants the greatest
enemies of their glory. In truth, Rome, which was founded and increased by the labors of
these ancient heroes, was more shamefully ruined by their descendants, while its walls were
still standing, than it is now by the razing of them. For in this ruin there fell stones and
timbers; but in the ruin those profligates effected, there fell, not the mural, but the moral
bulwarks and ornaments of the city, and their hearts burned with passions more destructive
than the flames which consumed their houses. Thus I brought my first book to a close.
And now I go on to speak of those calamities which that city itself, or its subject provinces,
have suffered since its foundation; all of which they would equally have attributed to the
Christian religion, if at that early period the doctrine of the gospel against their false and
deceiving gods had been as largely and freely proclaimed as now.</p>

Worship of the Gods.</head>
<p>But remember that, in recounting these things, I have still to address myself to ignorant
men; so ignorant, indeed, as to give birth to the common saying, “Drought and Christianity
go hand in hand.”88 There are indeed some among them who are thoroughly well-educated
men, and have a taste for history, in which the things I speak of are open to their observation;
but in order to irritate the uneducated masses against us, they feign ignorance of these events,
and do what they can to make the vulgar believe that those disasters, which in certain places
and at certain times uniformly befall mankind, are the result of Christianity, which is being
everywhere diffused, and is possessed of a renown and brilliancy which quite eclipse their
own gods.89 Let them then, along with us, call to mind with what various and repeated
disasters the prosperity of Rome was blighted, before ever Christ had come in the flesh, and
before His name had been blazoned among the nations with that glory which they vainly
grudge. Let them, if they can, defend their gods in this article, since they maintain that they
worship them in order to be preserved from these disasters, which they now impute to us
if they suffer in the least degree. For why did these gods permit the disasters I am to speak
of to fall on their worshippers before the preaching of Christ’s name offended them, and
put an end to their sacrifices?</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—That the Worshippers of the Gods Never Received from Them Any
Healthy Moral Precepts, and that in Celebrating Their Worship All Sorts of
Impurities Were Practiced.</head>
<p>First of all, we would ask why their gods took no steps to improve the morals of their
worshippers. That the true God should neglect those who did not seek His help, that was
but justice; but why did those gods, from whose worship ungrateful men are now complaining
that they are prohibited, issue no laws which might have guided their devotees to a virtuous
life? Surely it was but just, that such care as men showed to the worship of the gods, the
gods on their part should have to the conduct of men. But, it is replied, it is by his own will
a man goes astray. Who denies it? But none the less was it incumbent on these gods, who
were men’s guardians, to publish in plain terms the laws of a good life, and not to conceal
them from their worshippers. It was their part to send prophets to reach and convict such
as broke these laws, and publicly to proclaim the punishments which await evil-doers, and
the rewards which may be looked for by those that do well. Did ever the walls of any of
their temples echo to any such warning voice? I myself, when I was a young man, used
sometimes to go to the sacrilegious entertainments and spectacles; I saw the priests raving
in religious excitement, and heard the choristers; I took pleasure in the shameful games
which were celebrated in honor of gods and goddesses, of the virgin Coelestis,90 and
Berecynthia,91 the mother of all the gods. And on the holy day consecrated to her purification,
there were sung before her couch productions so obscene and filthy for the ear—I do
not say of the mother of the gods, but of the mother of any senator or honest man—nay, so
impure, that not even the mother of the foul-mouthed players themselves could have formed
one of the audience. For natural reverence for parents is a bond which the most abandoned
cannot ignore. And, accordingly, the lewd actions and filthy words with which these players
honored the mother of the gods, in presence of a vast assemblage and audience of both
sexes, they could not for very shame have rehearsed at home in presence of their own
mothers. And the crowds that were gathered from all quarters by curiosity, offended
modesty must, I should suppose, have scattered in the confusion of shame. If these are
sacred rites, what is sacrilege? If this is purification, what is pollution? This festivity was

was brought to Rome the day before the ides of April, which was accordingly dedicated as her feast-day. The
image, it seems, had to be washed in the stream Almon, a tributary of the Tiber, before being placed in the temple
of Victory; and each year, as the festival returned, the washing was repeated with much pomp at the same spot.

themselves off under the name of gods, and either disbelieves in their existence, or leads
such a life as prompts him rather to propitiate and fear them than the true God.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of the Obscenities Practiced in Honor of the Mother of the Gods.</head>
<p>In this matter I would prefer to have as my assessors in judgment, not those men who
rather take pleasure in these infamous customs than take pains to put an end to them, but
that same Scipio Nasica who was chosen by the senate as the citizen most worthy to receive
in his hands the image of that demon Cybele, and convey it into the city. He would tell us
whether he would be proud to see his own mother so highly esteemed by the state as to have
divine honors adjudged to her; as the Greeks and Romans and other nations have decreed
divine honors to men who had been of material service to them, and have believed that their
mortal benefactors were thus made immortal, and enrolled among the gods.93 Surely he
would desire that his mother should enjoy such felicity were it possible. But if we proceeded
to ask him whether, among the honors paid to her, he would wish such shameful rites as
these to be celebrated, would he not at once exclaim that he would rather his mother lay
stone-dead, than survive as a goddess to lend her ear to these obscenities? Is it possible that
he who was of so severe a morality, that he used his influence as a Roman senator to prevent
the building of a theatre in that city dedicated to the manly virtues, would wish his mother
to be propitiated as a goddess with words which would have brought the blush to her cheek
when a Roman matron? Could he possibly believe that the modesty of an estimable woman
would be so transformed by her promotion to divinity, that she would suffer herself to be
invoked and celebrated in terms so gross and immodest, that if she had heard the like while
alive upon earth, and had listened without stopping her ears and hurrying from the spot,
her relatives, her husband, and her children would have blushed for her? Therefore, the
mother of the gods being such a character as the most profligate man would be ashamed to
have for his mother, and meaning to enthral the minds of the Romans, demanded for her
service their best citizen, not to ripen him still more in virtue by her helpful counsel, but to
entangle him by her deceit, like her of whom it is written, “The adulteress will hunt for the
precious soul.”94 Her intent was to puff up this high- souled man by an apparently divine
testimony to his excellence, in order that he might rely upon his own eminence in virtue,
and make no further efforts after true piety and religion, without which natural genius,
however brilliant, vapors into pride and comes to nothing. For what but a guileful purpose
could that goddess demand the best man seeing that in her own sacred festivals she requires
such obscenities as the best men would be covered with shame to hear at their own tables?</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—That the Gods of the Pagans Never Inculcated Holiness of Life.</head>
<p>This is the reason why those divinities quite neglected the lives and morals of the cities
and nations who worshipped them, and threw no dreadful prohibition in their way to hinder
them from becoming utterly corrupt, and to preserve them from those terrible and detestable
evils which visit not harvests and vintages, not house and possessions, not the body which
is subject to the soul, but the soul itself, the spirit that rules the whole man. If there was any
such prohibition, let it be produced, let it be proved. They will tell us that purity and probity
were inculcated upon those who were initiated in the mysteries of religion, and that secret
incitements to virtue were whispered in the ear of the élite; but this is an idle boast. Let
them show or name to us the places which were at any time consecrated to assemblages in
which, instead of the obscene songs and licentious acting of players, instead of the celebration
of those most filthy and shameless Fugalia95 (well called Fugalia, since they banish modesty
and right feeling), the people were commanded in the name of the gods to restrain avarice,
bridle impurity, and conquer ambition; where, in short, they might learn in that school
which Persius vehemently lashes them to, when he says: “Be taught, ye abandoned creatures,
and ascertain the causes of things; what we are, and for what end we are born; what is the
law of our success in life; and by what art we may turn the goal without making shipwreck;
what limit we should put to our wealth, what we may lawfully desire, and what uses filthy
lucre serves; how much we should bestow upon our country and our family; learn, in short,
what God meant thee to be, and what place He has ordered you to fill.”96 Let them name
to us the places where such instructions were wont to be communicated from the gods, and
where the people who worshipped them were accustomed to resort to hear them, as we can
point to our churches built for this purpose in every land where the Christian religion is
received.</p>

Follow the Examples of the Gods Than to Obey the Precepts of Men.</head>
<p>But will they perhaps remind us of the schools of the philosophers, and their disputations?
In the first place, these belong not to Rome, but to Greece; and even if we yield to
them that they are now Roman, because Greece itself has become a Roman province, still
the teachings of the philosophers are not the commandments of the gods, but the discoveries
of men, who, at the prompting of their own speculative ability, made efforts to discover the
hidden laws of nature, and the right and wrong in ethics, and in dialectic what was consequent
according to the rules of logic, and what was inconsequent and erroneous. And some of
them, by God’s help, made great discoveries; but when left to themselves they were betrayed
by human infirmity, and fell into mistakes. And this was ordered by divine providence,
that their pride might be restrained, and that by their example it might be pointed out that
it is humility which has access to the highest regions. But of this we shall have more to say,
if the Lord God of truth permit, in its own place.97 However, if the philosophers have made
any discoveries which are sufficient to guide men to virtue and blessedness, would it not
have been greater justice to vote divine honors to them? Were it not more accordant with
every virtuous sentiment to read Plato’s writings in a “Temple of Plato,” than to be present
in the temples of devils to witness the priests of Cybele98 mutilating themselves, the effeminate
being consecrated, the raving fanatics cutting themselves, and whatever other cruel
or shameful, or shamefully cruel or cruelly shameful, ceremony is enjoined by the ritual of
such gods as these? Were it not a more suitable education, and more likely to prompt the
youth to virtue, if they heard public recitals of the laws of the gods, instead of the vain
laudation of the customs and laws of their ancestors? Certainly all the worshippers of the
Roman gods, when once they are possessed by what Persius calls “the burning poison of
lust,”99 prefer to witness the deeds of Jupiter rather than to hear what Plato taught or Cato
censured. Hence the young profligate in Terence, when he sees on the wall a fresco representing
the fabled descent of Jupiter into the lap of Danaë in the form of a golden shower,

similar fountain in Paphlagonia. Apuleius (Golden Ass, viii.) gives a graphic and humorous description of the
dress, dancing and imposture of these priests; mentioning, among other things, that they lashed themselves with
whips and cut themselves with knives till the ground was wet with blood.</note>

<head>Chapter 8.—That the Theatrical Exhibitions Publishing the Shameful Actions of the
Gods, Propitiated Rather Than Offended Them.</head>
<p>But, some one will interpose, these are the fables of poets, not the deliverances of the
gods themselves. Well, I have no mind to arbitrate between the lewdness of theatrical entertainments
and of mystic rites; only this I say, and history bears me out in making the assertion,
that those same entertainments, in which the fictions of poets are the main attraction,
were not introduced in the festivals of the gods by the ignorant devotion of the Romans,
but that the gods themselves gave the most urgent commands to this effect, and indeed extorted
from the Romans these solemnities and celebrations in their honor. I touched on
this in the preceding book, and mentioned that dramatic entertainments were first inaugurated
at Rome on occasion of a pestilence, and by authority of the pontiff. And what man is
there who is not more likely to adopt, for the regulation of his own life, the examples that
are represented in plays which have a divine sanction, rather than the precepts written and
promulgated with no more than human authority? If the poets gave a false representation
of Jove in describing him as adulterous, then it were to be expected that the chaste gods
should in anger avenge so wicked a fiction, in place of encouraging the games which circulated
it. Of these plays, the most inoffensive are comedies and tragedies, that is to say, the
dramas which poets write for the stage, and which, though they often handle impure subjects,
yet do so without the filthiness of language which characterizes many other performances;
and it is these dramas which boys are obliged by their seniors to read and learn as a part of
what is called a liberal and gentlemanly education.101</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—That the Poetical License Which the Greeks, in Obedience to Their
Gods, Allowed, Was Restrained by the Ancient Romans.</head>
<p>The opinion of the ancient Romans on this matter is attested by Cicero in his work De
Republica, in which Scipio, one of the interlocutors, says, “The lewdness of comedy could
never have been suffered by audiences, unless the customs of society had previously sanctioned
the same lewdness.” And in the earlier days the Greeks preserved a certain reasonableness
in their license, and made it a law, that whatever comedy wished to say of any one,
it must say it of him by name. And so in the same work of Cicero’s, Scipio says, “Whom
has it not aspersed? Nay, whom has it not worried? Whom has it spared? Allow that it
may assail demagogues and factions, men injurious to the commonwealth—a Cleon, a
Cleophon, a Hyperbolus. That is tolerable, though it had been more seemly for the public
censor to brand such men, than for a poet to lampoon them; but to blacken the fame of
Pericles with scurrilous verse, after he had with the utmost dignity presided over their state
alike in war and in peace, was as unworthy of a poet, as if our own Plautus or Nævius were
to bring Publius and Cneius Scipio on the comic stage, or as if Cæcilius were to caricature
Cato.” And then a little after he goes on: “Though our Twelve Tables attached the penalty
of death only to a very few offences, yet among these few this was one: if any man should
have sung a pasquinade, or have composed a satire calculated to bring infamy or disgrace
on another person. Wisely decreed. For it is by the decisions of magistrates, and by a wellinformed
justice, that our lives ought to be judged, and not by the flighty fancies of poets;
neither ought we to be exposed to hear calumnies, save where we have the liberty of replying,
and defending ourselves before an adequate tribunal.” This much I have judged it advisable
to quote from the fourth book of Cicero’s De Republica; and I have made the quotation
word for word, with the exception of some words omitted, and some slightly transposed,
for the sake of giving the sense more readily. And certainly the extract is pertinent to the
matter I am endeavoring to explain. Cicero makes some further remarks, and concludes
the passage by showing that the ancient Romans did not permit any living man to be either
praised or blamed on the stage. But the Greeks, as I said, though not so moral, were more
logical in allowing this license which the Romans forbade; for they saw that their gods approved
and enjoyed the scurrilous language of low comedy when directed not only against
men, but even against themselves; and this, whether the infamous actions imputed to them
were the fictions of poets, or were their actual iniquities commemorated and acted in the
theatres. And would that the spectators had judged them worthy only of laughter, and not
of imitation! Manifestly it had been a stretch of pride to spare the good name of the leading
men and the common citizens, when the very deities did not grudge that their own reputation
should be blemished.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—That the Devils, in Suffering Either False or True Crimes to Be Laid
to Their Charge, Meant to Do Men a Mischief.</head>
<p>It is alleged, in excuse of this practice, that the stories told of the gods are not true, but
false, and mere inventions, but this only makes matters worse, if we form our estimate by
the morality our religion teaches; and if we consider the malice of the devils, what more
wily and astute artifice could they practise upon men? When a slander is uttered against a
leading statesman of upright and useful life, is it not reprehensible in proportion to its untruth
and groundlessness? What punishment, then, shall be sufficient when the gods are the objects
of so wicked and outrageous an injustice? But the devils, whom these men repute gods, are
content that even iniquities they are guiltless of should be ascribed to them, so long as they
may entangle men’s minds in the meshes of these opinions, and draw them on along with
themselves to their predestinated punishment: whether such things were actually committed
by the men whom these devils, delighting in human infatuation, cause to be worshipped as
gods, and in whose stead they, by a thousand malign and deceitful artifices, substitute
themselves, and so receive worship; or whether, though they were really the crimes of men,
these wicked spirits gladly allowed them to be attributed to higher beings, that there might
seem to be conveyed from heaven itself a sufficient sanction for the perpetration of shameful
wickedness. The Greeks, therefore, seeing the character of the gods they served, thought
that the poets should certainly not refrain from showing up human vices on the stage, either
because they desired to be like their gods in this, or because they were afraid that, if they
required for themselves a more unblemished reputation than they asserted for the gods,
they might provoke them to anger.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—That the Greeks Admitted Players to Offices of State, on the Ground
that Men Who Pleased the Gods Should Not Be Contemptuously Treated by
Their Fellows.</head>
<p>It was a part of this same reasonableness of the Greeks which induced them to bestow
upon the actors of these same plays no inconsiderable civic honors. In the above-mentioned
book of the De Republica, it is mentioned that Aeschines, a very eloquent Athenian, who
had been a tragic actor in his youth, became a statesman, and that the Athenians again and
again sent another tragedian, Aristodemus, as their plenipotentiary to Philip. For they
judged it unbecoming to condemn and treat as infamous persons those who were the chief
actors in the scenic entertainments which they saw to be so pleasing to the gods. No doubt
this was immoral of the Greeks, but there can be as little doubt they acted in conformity
with the character of their gods; for how could they have presumed to protect the conduct
of the citizens from being cut to pieces by the tongues of poets and players, who were allowed,
and even enjoined by the gods, to tear their divine reputation to tatters? And how could
they hold in contempt the men who acted in the theatres those dramas which, as they had
ascertained, gave pleasure to the gods whom they worshipped? Nay, how could they but
grant to them the highest civic honors? On what plea could they honor the priests who
offered for them acceptable sacrifices to the gods, if they branded with infamy the actors
who in behalf of the people gave to the gods that pleasure or honour which they demanded,
and which, according to the account of the priests, they were angry at not receiving. Labeo,102
whose learning makes him an authority on such points, is of opinion that the distinction
between good and evil deities should find expression in a difference of worship; that the evil
should be propitiated by bloody sacrifices and doleful rites, but the good with a joyful and
pleasant observance, as, e.g. (as he says himself), with plays, festivals, and banquets.103 All
this we shall, with God’s help, hereafter discuss. At present, and speaking to the subject on
hand, whether all kinds of offerings are made indiscriminately to all the gods, as if all were
good (and it is an unseemly thing to conceive that there are evil gods; but these gods of the
pagans are all evil, because they are not gods, but evil spirits), or whether, as Labeo thinks,
a distinction is made between the offerings presented to the different gods the Greeks are
equally justified in honoring alike the priests by whom the sacrifices are offered, and the
players by whom the dramas are acted, that they may not be open to the charge of doing an

of Men Which They Allowed Them in the Case of the Gods, Showed a More
Delicate Sensitiveness Regarding Themselves than Regarding the Gods.</head>
<p>The Romans, however, as Scipio boasts in that same discussion, declined having their
conduct and good name subjected to the assaults and slanders of the poets, and went so far
as to make it a capital crime if any one should dare to compose such verses. This was a very
honorable course to pursue, so far as they themselves were concerned, but in respect of the
gods it was proud and irreligious: for they knew that the gods not only tolerated, but relished,
being lashed by the injurious expressions of the poets, and yet they themselves would not
suffer this same handling; and what their ritual prescribed as acceptable to the gods, their
law prohibited as injurious to themselves. How then, Scipio, do you praise the Romans for
refusing this license to the poets, so that no citizen could be calumniated, while you know
that the gods were not included under this protection? Do you count your senate-house
worthy of so much higher a regard than the Capitol? Is the one city of Rome more valuable
in your eyes than the whole heaven of gods, that you prohibit your poets from uttering any
injurious words against a citizen, though they may with impunity cast what imputations
they please upon the gods, without the interference of senator, censor, prince, or pontiff?
It was, forsooth, intolerable that Plautus or Nævus should attack Publius and Cneius Scipio,
insufferable that Cæcilius should lampoon Cato; but quite proper that your Terence should
encourage youthful lust by the wicked example of supreme Jove.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—That the Romans Should Have Understood that Gods Who Desired
to Be Worshipped in Licentious Entertainments Were Unworthy of Divine
Honor.</head>
<p>But Scipio, were he alive, would possibly reply: “How could we attach a penalty to that
which the gods themselves have consecrated? For the theatrical entertainments in which
such things are said, and acted, and performed, were introduced into Roman society by the
gods, who ordered that they should be dedicated and exhibited in their honor.” But was
not this, then, the plainest proof that they were no true gods, nor in any respect worthy of
receiving divine honours from the republic? Suppose they had required that in their honor
the citizens of Rome should be held up to ridicule, every Roman would have resented the
hateful proposal. How then, I would ask, can they be esteemed worthy of worship, when
they propose that their own crimes be used as material for celebrating their praises? Does
not this artifice expose them, and prove that they are detestable devils? Thus the Romans,
though they were superstitious enough to serve as gods those who made no secret of their
desire to be worshipped in licentious plays, yet had sufficient regard to their hereditary
dignity and virtue, to prompt them to refuse to players any such rewards as the Greeks accorded
them. On this point we have this testimony of Scipio, recorded in Cicero: “They
[the Romans] considered comedy and all theatrical performances as disgraceful, and
therefore not only debarred players from offices and honors open to ordinary citizens, but
also decreed that their names should be branded by the censor, and erased from the roll of
their tribe.” An excellent decree, and another testimony to the sagacity of Rome; but I could
wish their prudence had been more thorough-going and consistent. For when I hear that
if any Roman citizen chose the stage as his profession, he not only closed to himself every
laudable career, but even became an outcast from his own tribe, I cannot but exclaim: This
is the true Roman spirit, this is worthy of a state jealous of its reputation. But then some
one interrupts my rapture, by inquiring with what consistency players are debarred from
all honors, while plays are counted among the honors due to the gods? For a long while the
virtue of Rome was uncontaminated by theatrical exhibitions;104 and if they had been adopted
for the sake of gratifying the taste of the citizens, they would have been introduced hand in
hand with the relaxation of manners. But the fact is, that it was the gods who demanded
that they should be exhibited to gratify them. With what justice, then, is the player excommunicated
by whom God is worshipped? On what pretext can you at once adore him who
exacts, and brand him who acts these plays? This, then, is the controversy in which the
Greeks and Romans are engaged. The Greeks think they justly honor players, because they
<note type="footnote">104 According to Livy (vii. 2), theatrical exhibitions were introduced in the year 392 a.u.c. Before that time,
he says, there had only been the games of the circus. The Romans sent to Etruria for players, who were called
histriones, hister being the Tuscan word for a player. Other particulars are added by Livy.</note>

<pb n="86"/>
worship the gods who demand plays; the Romans, on the other hand, do not suffer an actor
to disgrace by his name his own plebeian tribe, far less the senatorial order. And the whole
of this discussion may be summed up in the following syllogism. The Greeks give us the
major premise: If such gods are to be worshipped, then certainly such men may be honored.
The Romans add the minor: But such men must by no means be honoured. The Christians
draw the conclusion: Therefore such gods must by no means be worshipped.</p>

<pb n="87"/>
<head>Chapter 14.—That Plato, Who Excluded Poets from a Well-Ordered City, Was
Better Than These Gods Who Desire to Be Honoured by Theatrical Plays.</head>
<p>We have still to inquire why the poets who write the plays, and who by the law of the
twelve tables are prohibited from injuring the good name of the citizens, are reckoned more
estimable than the actors, though they so shamefully asperse the character of the gods? Is
it right that the actors of these poetical and God-dishonoring effusions be branded, while
their authors are honored? Must we not here award the palm to a Greek, Plato, who, in
framing his ideal republic,105 conceived that poets should be banished from the city as enemies
of the state? He could not brook that the gods be brought into disrepute, nor that the
minds of the citizens be depraved and besotted, by the fictions of the poets. Compare now
human nature as you see it in Plato, expelling poets from the city that the citizens be uninjured,
with the divine nature as you see it in these gods exacting plays in their own honor.
Plato strove, though unsuccessfully, to persuade the light-minded and lascivious Greeks to
abstain from so much as writing such plays; the gods used their authority to extort the acting
of the same from the dignified and sober-minded Romans. And not content with having
them acted, they had them dedicated to themselves, consecrated to themselves, solemnly
celebrated in their own honor. To which, then, would it be more becoming in a state to
decree divine honors,—to Plato, who prohibited these wicked and licentious plays, or to
the demons who delighted in blinding men to the truth of what Plato unsuccessfully sought
to inculcate?</p>
<p>This philosopher, Plato, has been elevated by Labeo to the rank of a demigod, and set
thus upon a level with such as Hercules and Romulus. Labeo ranks demigods higher than
heroes, but both he counts among the deities. But I have no doubt that he thinks this man
whom he reckons a demigod worthy of greater respect not only than the heroes, but also
than the gods themselves. The laws of the Romans and the speculations of Plato have this
resemblance, that the latter pronounce a wholesale condemnation of poetical fictions, while
the former restrain the license of satire, at least so far as men are the objects of it. Plato will
not suffer poets even to dwell in his city: the laws of Rome prohibit actors from being enrolled
as citizens; and if they had not feared to offend the gods who had asked the services of the
players, they would in all likelihood have banished them altogether. It is obvious, therefore,
that the Romans could not receive, nor reasonably expect to receive, laws for the regulation
of their conduct from their gods, since the laws they themselves enacted far surpassed and
put to shame the morality of the gods. The gods demand stageplays in their own honor;
the Romans exclude the players from all civic honors;106 the former commanded that they
should be celebrated by the scenic representation of their own disgrace; the latter commanded
<note type="footnote">105 See the Republic, book iii.</note>
<note type="footnote">106 Comp. Tertullian, De Spectac. c. 22.</note>

<pb n="88"/>
that no poet should dare to blemish the reputation of any citizen. But that demigod Plato
resisted the lust of such gods as these, and showed the Romans what their genius had left
incomplete; for he absolutely excluded poets from his ideal state, whether they composed
fictions with no regard to truth, or set the worst possible examples before wretched men
under the guise of divine actions. We for our part, indeed, reckon Plato neither a god nor
a demigod; we would not even compare him to any of God’s holy angels; nor to the truthspeaking
prophets, nor to any of the apostles or martyrs of Christ, nay, not to any faithful
Christian man. The reason of this opinion of ours we will, God prospering us, render in its
own place. Nevertheless, since they wish him to be considered a demigod, we think he
certainly is more entitled to that rank, and is every way superior, if not to Hercules and
Romulus (though no historian could ever narrate nor any poet sing of him that he had killed
his brother, or committed any crime), yet certainly to Priapus, or a Cynocephalus,107 or the
Fever,108—divinities whom the Romans have partly received from foreigners, and partly
consecrated by home-grown rites. How, then, could gods such as these be expected to
promulgate good and wholesome laws, either for the prevention of moral and social evils,
or for their eradication where they had already sprung up?—gods who used their influence
even to sow and cherish profligacy, by appointing that deeds truly or falsely ascribed to
them should be published to the people by means of theatrical exhibitions, and by thus
gratuitously fanning the flame of human lust with the breath of a seemingly divine approbation.
In vain does Cicero, speaking of poets, exclaim against this state of things in these
words: “When the plaudits and acclamation of the people, who sit as infallible judges, are
won by the poets, what darkness benights the mind, what fears invade, what passions inflame
it!”109</p>

Gods.</head>
<p>But is it not manifest that vanity rather than reason regulated the choice of some of their
false gods? This Plato, whom they reckon a demigod, and who used all his eloquence to
preserve men from the most dangerous spiritual calamities, has yet not been counted worthy
even of a little shrine; but Romulus, because they can call him their own, they have esteemed
more highly than many gods, though their secret doctrine can allow him the rank only of
a demigod. To him they allotted a flamen, that is to say, a priest of a class so highly esteemed
in their religion (distinguished, too, by their conical mitres), that for only three of their gods
were flamens appointed,—the Flamen Dialis for Jupiter, Martialis for Mars, and Quirinalis
for Romulus (for when the ardor of his fellow-citizens had given Romulus a seat among the
gods, they gave him this new name Quirinus). And thus by this honor Romulus has been
preferred to Neptune and Pluto, Jupiter’s brothers, and to Saturn himself, their father. They
have assigned the same priesthood to serve him as to serve Jove; and in giving Mars (the
reputed father of Romulus) the same honor, is this not rather for Romulus’ sake than to
honor Mars?</p>

<pb n="90"/>
<head>Chapter 16.—That If the Gods Had Really Possessed Any Regard for Righteousness,
the Romans Should Have Received Good Laws from Them, Instead of Having
to Borrow Them from Other Nations.</head>
<p>Moreover, if the Romans had been able to receive a rule of life from their gods, they
would not have borrowed Solon’s laws from the Athenians, as they did some years after
Rome was founded; and yet they did not keep them as they received them, but endeavored
to improve and amend them.110 Although Lycurgus pretended that he was authorized by
Apollo to give laws to the Lacedemonians, the sensible Romans did not choose to believe
this, and were not induced to borrow laws from Sparta. Numa Pompilius, who succeeded
Romulus in the kingdom, is said to have framed some laws, which, however, were not sufficient
for the regulation of civic affairs. Among these regulations were many pertaining to
religious observances, and yet he is not reported to have received even these from the gods.
With respect, then, to moral evils, evils of life and conduct,—evils which are so mighty, that,
according to the wisest pagans,111 by them states are ruined while their cities stand uninjured,—
their gods made not the smallest provision for preserving their worshippers from
these evils, but, on the contrary, took special pains to increase them, as we have previously
endeavored to prove.</p>
<note type="footnote">110 In the year a.u. 299, three ambassadors were sent from Rome to Athens to copy Solon’s laws, and acquire
information about the institutions of Greece. On their return the Decemviri were appointed to draw up a code;
and finally, after some tragic interruptions, the celebrated twelve tables were accepted as the fundamental statutes
of Roman law (fons universi publici privatique juris). These were graven on brass, and hung up for public information.

<pb n="91"/>
<head>Chapter 17.—Of the Rape of the Sabine Women, and Other Iniquities Perpetrated
in Rome’s Palmiest Days.</head>
<p>But possibly we are to find the reason for this neglect of the Romans by their gods, in
the saying of Sallust, that “equity and virtue prevailed among the Romans not more by force
of laws than of nature.”112 I presume it is to this inborn equity and goodness of disposition
we are to ascribe the rape of the Sabine women. What, indeed, could be more equitable and
virtuous, than to carry off by force, as each man was fit, and without their parents’ consent,
girls who were strangers and guests, and who had been decoyed and entrapped by the pretence
of a spectacle! If the Sabines were wrong to deny their daughters when the Romans
asked for them, was it not a greater wrong in the Romans to carry them off after that denial?
The Romans might more justly have waged war against the neighboring nation for having
refused their daughters in marriage when they first sought them, than for having demanded
them back when they had stolen them. War should have been proclaimed at first; it was
then that Mars should have helped his warlike son, that he might by force of arms avenge
the injury done him by the refusal of marriage, and might also thus win the women he desired.
There might have been some appearance of “right of war” in a victor carrying off, in
virtue of this right, the virgins who had been without any show of right denied him;
whereas there was no “right of peace” entitling him to carry off those who were not given
to him, and to wage an unjust war with their justly enraged parents. One happy circumstance
was indeed connected with this act of violence, viz., that though it was commemorated by
the games of the circus, yet even this did not constitute it a precedent in the city or realm
of Rome. If one would find fault with the results of this act, it must rather be on the ground
that the Romans made Romulus a god in spite of his perpetrating this iniquity; for one
cannot reproach them with making this deed any kind of precedent for the rape of women.</p>
<p>Again, I presume it was due to this natural equity and virtue, that after the expulsion
of King Tarquin, whose son had violated Lucretia, Junius Brutus the consul forced Lucius
Tarquinius Collatinus, Lucretia’s husband and his own colleague, a good and innocent man,
to resign his office and go into banishment, on the one sole charge that he was of the name
and blood of the Tarquins. This injustice was perpetrated with the approval, or at least
connivance, of the people, who had themselves raised to the consular office both Collatinus
and Brutus. Another instance of this equity and virtue is found in their treatment of Marcus
Camillus. This eminent man, after he had rapidly conquered the Veians, at that time the
most formidable of Rome’s enemies, and who had maintained a ten years’ war, in which
the Roman army had suffered the usual calamities attendant on bad generalship, after he
had restored security to Rome, which had begun to tremble for its safety, and after he had

taken the wealthiest city of the enemy, had charges brought against him by the malice of
those that envied his success, and by the insolence of the tribunes of the people; and seeing
that the city bore him no gratitude for preserving it, and that he would certainly be condemned,
he went into exile, and even in his absence was fined 10,000 asses. Shortly after,
however, his ungrateful country had again to seek his protection from the Gauls. But I
cannot now mention all the shameful and iniquitous acts with which Rome was agitated,
when the aristocracy attempted to subject the people, and the people resented their encroachments,
and the advocates of either party were actuated rather by the love of victory than by
any equitable or virtuous consideration.</p>

<pb n="93"/>
<head>Chapter 18.—What the History of Sallust Reveals Regarding the Life of the Romans,
Either When Straitened by Anxiety or Relaxed in Security.</head>
<p>I will therefore pause, and adduce the testimony of Sallust himself, whose words in
praise of the Romans (that “equity and virtue prevailed among them not more by force of
laws than of nature”) have given occasion to this discussion. He was referring to that period
immediately after the expulsion of the kings, in which the city became great in an incredibly
short space of time. And yet this same writer acknowledges in the first book of his history,
in the very exordium of his work, that even at that time, when a very brief interval had
elapsed after the government had passed from kings to consuls, the more powerful men
began to act unjustly, and occasioned the defection of the people from the patricians, and
other disorders in the city. For after Sallust had stated that the Romans enjoyed greater
harmony and a purer state of society between the second and third Punic wars than at any
other time, and that the cause of this was not their love of good order, but their fear lest the
peace they had with Carthage might be broken (this also, as we mentioned, Nasica contemplated
when he opposed the destruction of Carthage, for he supposed that fear would tend
to repress wickedness, and to preserve wholesome ways of living), he then goes on to say:
“Yet, after the destruction of Carthage, discord, avarice, ambition, and the other vices which
are commonly generated by prosperity, more than ever increased.” If they “increased,” and
that “more than ever,” then already they had appeared, and had been increasing. And so
Sallust adds this reason for what he said. “For,” he says, “the oppressive measures of the
powerful, and the consequent secessions of the plebs from the patricians, and other civil
dissensions, had existed from the first, and affairs were administered with equity and welltempered
justice for no longer a period than the short time after the expulsion of the kings,
while the city was occupied with the serious Tuscan war and Tarquin’s vengeance.” You
see how, even in that brief period after the expulsion of the kings, fear, he acknowledges,
was the cause of the interval of equity and good order. They were afraid, in fact, of the war
which Tarquin waged against them, after he had been driven from the throne and the city,
and had allied himself with the Tuscans. But observe what he adds: “After that, the patricians
treated the people as their slaves, ordering them to be scourged or beheaded just as the kings
had done, driving them from their holdings, and harshly tyrannizing over those who had
no property to lose. The people, overwhelmed by these oppressive measures, and most of
all by exorbitant usury, and obliged to contribute both money and personal service to the
constant wars, at length took arms and seceded to Mount Aventine and Mount Sacer, and
thus obtained for themselves tribunes and protective laws. But it was only the second Punic
war that put an end on both sides to discord and strife.” You see what kind of men the Romans
were, even so early as a few years after the expulsion of the kings; and it is of these
men he says, that “equity and virtue prevailed among them not more by force of law than
of nature.”</p>

<pb n="94"/>
<p>Now, if these were the days in which the Roman republic shows fairest and best, what
are we to say or think of the succeeding age, when, to use the words of the same historian,
“changing little by little from the fair and virtuous city it was, it became utterly wicked and
dissolute?” This was, as he mentions, after the destruction of Carthage. Sallust’s brief sum
and sketch of this period may be read in his own history, in which he shows how the profligate
manners which were propagated by prosperity resulted at last even in civil wars. He
says: “And from this time the primitive manners, instead of undergoing an insensible alteration
as hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent: the young men were so
depraved by luxury and avarice, that it may justly be said that no father had a son who could
either preserve his own patrimony, or keep his hands off other men’s.” Sallust adds a
number of particulars about the vices of Sylla, and the debased condition of the republic in
general; and other writers make similar observations, though in much less striking language.</p>
<p>However, I suppose you now see, or at least any one who gives his attention has the
means of seeing, in what a sink of iniquity that city was plunged before the advent of our
heavenly King. For these things happened not only before Christ had begun to teach, but
before He was even born of the Virgin. If, then, they dare not impute to their gods the
grievous evils of those former times, more tolerable before the destruction of Carthage, but
intolerable and dreadful after it, although it was the gods who by their malign craft instilled
into the minds of men the conceptions from which such dreadful vices branched out on all
sides, why do they impute these present calamities to Christ, who teaches life-giving truth,
and forbids us to worship false and deceitful gods, and who, abominating and condemning
with His divine authority those wicked and hurtful lusts of men, gradually withdraws His
own people from a world that is corrupted by these vices, and is falling into ruins, to make
of them an eternal city, whose glory rests not on the acclamations of vanity, but on the
judgment of truth?</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Of the Corruption Which Had Grown Upon the Roman Republic
Before Christ Abolished the Worship of the Gods.</head>
<p>Here, then, is this Roman republic, “which has changed little by little from the fair and
virtuous city it was, and has become utterly wicked and dissolute.” It is not I who am the
first to say this, but their own authors, from whom we learned it for a fee, and who wrote
it long before the coming of Christ. You see how, before the coming of Christ, and after
the destruction of Carthage, “the primitive manners, instead of undergoing insensible alteration,
as hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent; and how depraved by
luxury and avarice the youth were.” Let them now, on their part, read to us any laws given
by their gods to the Roman people, and directed against luxury and avarice. And would
that they had only been silent on the subjects of chastity and modesty, and had not demanded
from the people indecent and shameful practices, to which they lent a pernicious patronage
by their so-called divinity. Let them read our commandments in the Prophets, Gospels,
Acts of the Apostles or Epistles; let them peruse the large number of precepts against avarice
and luxury which are everywhere read to the congregations that meet for this purpose, and
which strike the ear, not with the uncertain sound of a philosophical discussion, but with
the thunder of God’s own oracle pealing from the clouds. And yet they do not impute to
their gods the luxury and avarice, the cruel and dissolute manners, that had rendered the
republic utterly wicked and corrupt, even before the coming of Christ; but whatever affliction
their pride and effeminacy have exposed them to in these latter days, they furiously impute
to our religion. If the kings of the earth and all their subjects, if all princes and judges of
the earth, if young men and maidens, old and young, every age, and both sexes; if they whom
the Baptist addressed, the publicans and the soldiers, were all together to hearken to and
observe the precepts of the Christian religion regarding a just and virtuous life, then should
the republic adorn the whole earth with its own felicity, and attain in life everlasting to the
pinnacle of kingly glory. But because this man listens and that man scoffs, and most are
enamored of the blandishments of vice rather than the wholesome severity of virtue, the
people of Christ, whatever be their condition—whether they be kings, princes, judges, soldiers,
or provincials, rich or poor, bond or free, male or female—are enjoined to endure this
earthly republic, wicked and dissolute as it is, that so they may by this endurance win for
themselves an eminent place in that most holy and august assembly of angels and republic
of heaven, in which the will of God is the law.</p>

<p>But the worshippers and admirers of these gods delight in imitating their scandalous
iniquities, and are nowise concerned that the republic be less depraved and licentious. Only
let it remain undefeated, they say, only let it flourish and abound in resources; let it be
glorious by its victories, or still better, secure in peace; and what matters it to us? This is
our concern, that every man be able to increase his wealth so as to supply his daily prodigalities,
and so that the powerful may subject the weak for their own purposes. Let the poor
court the rich for a living, and that under their protection they may enjoy a sluggish tranquillity;
and let the rich abuse the poor as their dependants, to minister to their pride. Let
the people applaud not those who protect their interests, but those who provide them with
pleasure. Let no severe duty be commanded, no impurity forbidden. Let kings estimate
their prosperity, not by the righteousness, but by the servility of their subjects. Let the
provinces stand loyal to the kings, not as moral guides, but as lords of their possessions and
purveyors of their pleasures; not with a hearty reverence, but a crooked and servile fear.
Let the laws take cognizance rather of the injury done to another man’s property, than of
that done to one’s own person. If a man be a nuisance to his neighbor, or injure his property,
family, or person, let him be actionable; but in his own affairs let everyone with impunity
do what he will in company with his own family, and with those who willingly join him.
Let there be a plentiful supply of public prostitutes for every one who wishes to use them,
but specially for those who are too poor to keep one for their private use. Let there be
erected houses of the largest and most ornate description: in these let there be provided the
most sumptuous banquets, where every one who pleases may, by day or night, play, drink,
vomit,113 dissipate. Let there be everywhere heard the rustling of dancers, the loud, immodest
laughter of the theatre; let a succession of the most cruel and the most voluptuous pleasures
maintain a perpetual excitement. If such happiness is distasteful to any, let him be branded
as a public enemy; and if any attempt to modify or put an end to it let him be silenced,
banished, put an end to. Let these be reckoned the true gods, who procure for the people
this condition of things, and preserve it when once possessed. Let them be worshipped as
they wish; let them demand whatever games they please, from or with their own worshippers;
only let them secure that such felicity be not imperilled by foe, plague, or disaster of any
kind. What sane man would compare a republic such as this, I will not say to the Roman
empire, but to the palace of Sardanapalus, the ancient king who was so abandoned to
pleasures, that he caused it to be inscribed on his tomb, that now that he was dead, he possessed
only those things which he had swallowed and consumed by his appetites while alive?

<p>But if our adversaries do not care how foully and disgracefully the Roman republic be
stained by corrupt practices, so long only as it holds together and continues in being, and
if they therefore pooh-pooh the testimony of Sallust to its “utterly wicked and profligate”
condition, what will they make of Cicero’s statement, that even in his time it had become
entirely extinct, and that there remained extant no Roman republic at all? He introduces
Scipio (the Scipio who had destroyed Carthage) discussing the republic, at a time when
already there were presentiments of its speedy ruin by that corruption which Sallust describes.
In fact, at the time when the discussion took place, one of the Gracchi, who, according
to Sallust, was the first great instigator of seditions, had already been put to death. His
death, indeed, is mentioned in the same book. Now Scipio, at the end of the second book,
says: “As among the different sounds which proceed from lyres, flutes, and the human
voice, there must be maintained a certain harmony which a cultivated ear cannot endure
to hear disturbed or jarring, but which may be elicited in full and absolute concord by the
modulation even of voices very unlike one another; so, where reason is allowed to modulate
the diverse elements of the state, there is obtained a perfect concord from the upper, lower,
and middle classes as from various sounds; and what musicians call harmony in singing, is
concord in matters of state, which is the strictest bond and best security of any republic,
and which by no ingenuity can be retained where justice has become extinct.” Then, when
he had expatiated somewhat more fully, and had more copiously illustrated the benefits of
its presence and the ruinous effects of its absence upon a state, Pilus, one of the company
present at the discussion, struck in and demanded that the question should be more thoroughly
sifted, and that the subject of justice should be freely discussed for the sake of ascertaining
what truth there was in the maxim which was then becoming daily more current,
that “the republic cannot be governed without injustice.” Scipio expressed his willingness
to have this maxim discussed and sifted, and gave it as his opinion that it was baseless, and
that no progress could be made in discussing the republic unless it was established, not only
that this maxim, that “the republic cannot be governed without injustice,” was false, but
also that the truth is, that it cannot be governed without the most absolute justice. And the
discussion of this question, being deferred till the next day, is carried on in the third book
with great animation. For Pilus himself undertook to defend the position that the republic
cannot be governed without injustice, at the same time being at special pains to clear himself
of any real participation in that opinion. He advocated with great keenness the cause of
injustice against justice, and endeavored by plausible reasons and examples to demonstrate
that the former is beneficial, the latter useless, to the republic. Then, at the request of the
company, Lælius attempted to defend justice, and strained every nerve to prove that nothing
is so hurtful to a state as injustice; and that without justice a republic can neither be governed,
nor even continue to exist.</p>

<pb n="99"/>
<p>When this question has been handled to the satisfaction of the company, Scipio reverts
to the original thread of discourse, and repeats with commendation his own brief definition
of a republic, that it is the weal of the people. “The people” he defines as being not every
assemblage or mob, but an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of law,
and by a community of interests. Then he shows the use of definition in debate; and from
these definitions of his own he gathers that a republic, or “weal of the people,” then exists
only when it is well and justly governed, whether by a monarch, or an aristocracy, or by the
whole people. But when the monarch is unjust, or, as the Greeks say, a tyrant; or the aristocrats
are unjust, and form a faction; or the people themselves are unjust, and become, as
Scipio for want of a better name calls them, themselves the tyrant, then the republic is not
only blemished (as had been proved the day before), but by legitimate deduction from those
definitions, it altogether ceases to be. For it could not be the people’s weal when a tyrant
factiously lorded it over the state; neither would the people be any longer a people if it were
unjust, since it would no longer answer the definition of a people—“an assemblage associated
by a common acknowledgment of law, and by a community of interests.”</p>
<p>When, therefore, the Roman republic was such as Sallust described it, it was not “utterly
wicked and profligate,” as he says, but had altogether ceased to exist, if we are to admit the
reasoning of that debate maintained on the subject of the republic by its best representatives.
Tully himself, too, speaking not in the person of Scipio or any one else, but uttering his own
sentiments, uses the following language in the beginning of the fifth book, after quoting a
line from the poet Ennius, in which he said, “Rome’s severe morality and her citizens are
her safeguard.” “This verse,” says Cicero, “seems to me to have all the sententious truthfulness
of an oracle. For neither would the citizens have availed without the morality of the community,
nor would the morality of the commons without outstanding men have availed
either to establish or so long to maintain in vigor so grand a republic with so wide and just
an empire. Accordingly, before our day, the hereditary usages formed our foremost men,
and they on their part retained the usages and institutions of their fathers. But our age, receiving
the republic as a chef-d’oeuvre of another age which has already begun to grow old,
has not merely neglected to restore the colors of the original, but has not even been at the
pains to preserve so much as the general outline and most outstanding features. For what
survives of that primitive morality which the poet called Rome’s safeguard? It is so obsolete
and forgotten, that, far from practising it, one does not even know it. And of the citizens
what shall I say? Morality has perished through poverty of great men; a poverty for which
we must not only assign a reason, but for the guilt of which we must answer as criminals
charged with a capital crime. For it is through our vices, and not by any mishap, that we
retain only the name of a republic, and have long since lost the reality.”</p>
<p>This is the confession of Cicero, long indeed after the death of Africanus, whom he introduced
as an interlocutor in his work De Republica, but still before the coming of Christ.

<pb n="100"/>
Yet, if the disasters he bewails had been lamented after the Christian religion had been diffused,
and had begun to prevail, is there a man of our adversaries who would not have
thought that they were to be imputed to the Christians? Why, then, did their gods not take
steps then to prevent the decay and extinction of that republic, over the loss of which Cicero,
long before Christ had come in the flesh, sings so lugubrious a dirge? Its admirers have
need to inquire whether, even in the days of primitive men and morals, true justice flourished
in it; or was it not perhaps even then, to use the casual expression of Cicero, rather a colored
painting than the living reality? But, if God will, we shall consider this elsewhere. For I
mean in its own place to show that—according to the definitions in which Cicero himself,
using Scipio as his mouthpiece, briefly propounded what a republic is, and what a people
is, and according to many testimonies, both of his own lips and of those who took part in
that same debate—Rome never was a republic, because true justice had never a place in it.
But accepting the more feasible definitions of a republic, I grant there was a republic of a
certain kind, and certainly much better administered by the more ancient Romans than by
their modern representatives. But the fact is, true justice has no existence save in that republic
whose founder and ruler is Christ, if at least any choose to call this a republic; and indeed
we cannot deny that it is the people’s weal. But if perchance this name, which has become
familiar in other connections, be considered alien to our common parlance, we may at all
events say that in this city is true justice; the city of which Holy Scripture says, “Glorious
things are said of thee, O city of God.”</p>

<pb n="101"/>
<head>Chapter 22.—That the Roman Gods Never Took Any Steps to Prevent the Republic
from Being Ruined by Immorality.</head>
<p>But what is relevant to the present question is this, that however admirable our adversaries
say the republic was or is, it is certain that by the testimony of their own most learned
writers it had become, long before the coming of Christ, utterly wicked and dissolute, and
indeed had no existence, but had been destroyed by profligacy. To prevent this, surely these
guardian gods ought to have given precepts of morals and a rule of life to the people by
whom they were worshipped in so many temples, with so great a variety of priests and sacrifices,
with such numberless and diverse rites, so many festal solemnities, so many celebrations
of magnificent games. But in all this the demons only looked after their own interest,
and cared not at all how their worshippers lived, or rather were at pains to induce them to
lead an abandoned life, so long as they paid these tributes to their honor, and regarded them
with fear. If any one denies this, let him produce, let him point to, let him read the laws
which the gods had given against sedition, and which the Gracchi transgressed when they
threw everything into confusion; or those Marius, and Cinna, and Carbo broke when they
involved their country in civil wars, most iniquitous and unjustifiable in their causes, cruelly
conducted, and yet more cruelly terminated; or those which Sylla scorned, whose life,
character, and deeds, as described by Sallust and other historians, are the abhorrence of all
mankind. Who will deny that at that time the republic had become extinct?</p>
<p>Possibly they will be bold enough to suggest in defence of the gods, that they abandoned
the city on account of the profligacy of the citizens, according to the lines of Virgil:
<lg>
<l>“Gone from each fane, each sacred shrine,</l>
<l>Are those who made this realm divine.”114</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But, firstly, if it be so, then they cannot complain against the Christian religion, as if it
were that which gave offence to the gods and caused them to abandon Rome, since the Roman
immorality had long ago driven from the altars of the city a cloud of little gods, like as many
flies. And yet where was this host of divinities, when, long before the corruption of the
primitive morality, Rome was taken and burnt by the Gauls? Perhaps they were present,
but asleep? For at that time the whole city fell into the hands of the enemy, with the single
exception of the Capitoline hill; and this too would have been taken, had not—the watchful
geese aroused the sleeping gods! And this gave occasion to the festival of the goose, in which
Rome sank nearly to the superstition of the Egyptians, who worship beasts and birds. But
of these adventitious evils which are inflicted by hostile armies or by some disaster, and
which attach rather to the body than the soul, I am not meanwhile disputing. At present I
speak of the decay of morality, which at first almost imperceptibly lost its brilliant hue, but
<note type="footnote">114 Æneid, ii. 351–2.</note>

<pb n="102"/>
afterwards was wholly obliterated, was swept away as by a torrent, and involved the republic
in such disastrous ruin, that though the houses and walls remained standing the leading
writers do not scruple to say that the republic was destroyed. Now, the departure of the
gods “from each fane, each sacred shrine,” and their abandonment of the city to destruction,
was an act of justice, if their laws inculcating justice and a moral life had been held in contempt
by that city. But what kind of gods were these, pray, who declined to live with a people
who worshipped them, and whose corrupt life they had done nothing to reform?</p>

<pb n="103"/>
<head>Chapter 23.—That the Vicissitudes of This Life are Dependent Not on the Favor or
Hostility of Demons, But on the Will of the True God.</head>
<p>But, further, is it not obvious that the gods have abetted the fulfilment of men’s desires,
instead of authoritatively bridling them? For Marius, a low-born and self-made man, who
ruthlessly provoked and conducted civil wars, was so effectually aided by them, that he was
seven times consul, and died full of years in his seventh consulship, escaping the hands of
Sylla, who immediately afterwards came into power. Why, then, did they not also aid him,
so as to restrain him from so many enormities? For if it is said that the gods had no hand
in his success, this is no trivial admission that a man can attain the dearly coveted felicity
of this life even though his own gods be not propitious; that men can be loaded with the
gifts of fortune as Marius was, can enjoy health, power, wealth, honours, dignity, length of
days, though the gods be hostile to him; and that, on the other hand, men can be tormented
as Regulus was, with captivity, bondage, destitution, watchings, pain, and cruel death, though
the gods be his friends. To concede this is to make a compendious confession that the gods
are useless, and their worship superfluous. If the gods have taught the people rather what
goes clean counter to the virtues of the soul, and that integrity of life which meets a reward
after death; if even in respect of temporal and transitory blessings they neither hurt those
whom they hate nor profit whom they love, why are they worshipped, why are they invoked
with such eager homage? Why do men murmur in difficult and sad emergencies, as if the
gods had retired in anger? and why, on their account, is the Christian religion injured by
the most unworthy calumnies? If in temporal matters they have power either for good or
for evil, why did they stand by Marius, the worst of Rome’s citizens, and abandon Regulus,
the best? Does this not prove themselves to be most unjust and wicked? And even if it be
supposed that for this very reason they are the rather to be feared and worshipped, this is a
mistake; for we do not read that Regulus worshipped them less assiduously than Marius.
Neither is it apparent that a wicked life is to be chosen, on the ground that the gods are
supposed to have favored Marius more than Regulus. For Metellus, the most highly esteemed
of all the Romans, who had five sons in the consulship, was prosperous even in this life; and
Catiline, the worst of men, reduced to poverty and defeated in the war his own guilt had
aroused, lived and perished miserably. Real and secure felicity is the peculiar possession of
those who worship that God by whom alone it can be conferred.</p>
<p>It is thus apparent, that when the republic was being destroyed by profligate manners,
its gods did nothing to hinder its destruction by the direction or correction of its manners,
but rather accelerated its destruction by increasing the demoralization and corruption that
already existed. They need not pretend that their goodness was shocked by the iniquity of

<pb n="104"/>
the city, and that they withdrew in anger. For they were there, sure enough; they are detected,
convicted: they were equally unable to break silence so as to guide others, and to keep silence
so as to conceal themselves. I do not dwell on the fact that the inhabitants of Minturnæ
took pity on Marius, and commended him to the goddess Marica in her grove, that she
might give him success in all things, and that from the abyss of despair in which he then lay
he forthwith returned unhurt to Rome, and entered the city the ruthless leader of a ruthless
army; and they who wish to know how bloody was his victory, how unlike a citizen, and
how much more relentlessly than any foreign foe he acted, let them read the histories. But
this, as I said, I do not dwell upon; nor do I attribute the bloody bliss of Marius to, I know
not what Minturnian goddess [Marica], but rather to the secret providence of God, that the
mouths of our adversaries might be shut, and that they who are not led by passion, but by
prudent consideration of events, might be delivered from error. And even if the demons
have any power in these matters, they have only that power which the secret decree of the
Almighty allots to them, in order that we may not set too great store by earthly prosperity,
seeing it is oftentimes vouchsafed even to wicked men like Marius; and that we may not, on
the other hand, regard it as an evil, since we see that many good and pious worshippers of
the one true God are, in spite of the demons pre-eminently successful; and, finally, that we
may not suppose that these unclean spirits are either to be propitiated or feared for the sake
of earthly blessings or calamities: for as wicked men on earth cannot do all they would, so
neither can these demons, but only in so far as they are permitted by the decree of Him
whose judgments are fully comprehensible, justly reprehensible by none.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
<pb n="105"/>
<head>Chapter 24.—Of the Deeds of Sylla, in Which the Demons Boasted that He Had
Their Help.</head>
<p>It is certain that Sylla—whose rule was so cruel that, in comparison with it, the preceding
state of things which he came to avenge was regretted—when first he advanced towards
Rome to give battle to Marius, found the auspices so favourable when he sacrificed, that,
according to Livy’s account, the augur Postumius expressed his willingness to lose his head
if Sylla did not, with the help of the gods, accomplish what he designed. The gods, you see,
had not departed from “every fane and sacred shrine,” since they were still predicting the
issue of these affairs, and yet were taking no steps to correct Sylla himself. Their presages
promised him great prosperity but no threatenings of theirs subdued his evil passions. And
then, when he was in Asia conducting the war against Mithridates, a message from Jupiter
was delivered to him by Lucius Titius, to the effect that he would conquer Mithridates; and
so it came to pass. And afterwards, when he was meditating a return to Rome for the purpose
of avenging in the blood of the citizens injuries done to himself and his friends, a second
message from Jupiter was delivered to him by a soldier of the sixth legion, to the effect that
it was he who had predicted the victory over Mithridates, and that now he promised to give
him power to recover the republic from his enemies, though with great bloodshed. Sylla at
once inquired of the soldier what form had appeared to him; and, on his reply, recognized
that it was the same as Jupiter had formerly employed to convey to him the assurance regarding
the victory over Mithridates. How, then, can the gods be justified in this matter for
the care they took to predict these shadowy successes, and for their negligence in correcting
Sylla, and restraining him from stirring up a civil war so lamentable and atrocious, that it
not merely disfigured, but extinguished, the republic? The truth is, as I have often said, and
as Scripture informs us, and as the facts themselves sufficiently indicate, the demons are
found to look after their own ends only, that they may be regarded and worshipped as gods,
and that men may be induced to offer to them a worship which associates them with their
crimes, and involves them in one common wickedness and judgment of God.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when Sylla had come to Tarentum, and had sacrificed there, he saw on the
head of the victim’s liver the likeness of a golden crown. Thereupon the same soothsayer
Postumius interpreted this to signify a signal victory, and ordered that he only should eat
of the entrails. A little afterwards, the slave of a certain Lucius Pontius cried out, “I am
Bellona’s messenger; the victory is yours, Sylla!” Then he added that the Capitol should be
burned. As soon as he had uttered this prediction he left the camp, but returned the following
day more excited than ever, and shouted, “The Capitol is fired!” And fired indeed it was.
This it was easy for a demon both to foresee and quickly to announce. But observe, as relevant
to our subject, what kind of gods they are under whom these men desire to live, who
blaspheme the Saviour that delivers the wills of the faithful from the dominion of devils.

<pb n="106"/>
The man cried out in prophetic rapture, “The victory is yours, Sylla!” And to certify that
he spoke by a divine spirit, he predicted also an event which was shortly to happen, and
which indeed did fall out, in a place from which he in whom this spirit was speaking was
far distant. But he never cried, “Forbear thy villanies, Sylla!”—the villanies which were
committed at Rome by that victor to whom a golden crown on the calf’s liver had been
shown as the divine evidence of his victory. If such signs as this were customarily sent by
just gods, and not by wicked demons, then certainly the entrails he consulted should rather
have given Sylla intimation of the cruel disasters that were to befall the city and himself.
For that victory was not so conducive to his exaltation to power, as it was fatal to his ambition;
for by it he became so insatiable in his desires, and was rendered so arrogant and reckless
by prosperity, that he may be said rather to have inflicted a moral destruction on himself
than corporal destruction on his enemies. But these truely woeful and deplorable calamities
the gods gave him no previous hint of, neither by entrails, augury, dream, nor prediction.
For they feared his amendment more than his defeat. Yea, they took good care that this
glorious conqueror of his own fellow-citizens should be conquered and led captive by his
own infamous vices, and should thus be the more submissive slave of the demons themselves.</p>

<pb n="107"/>
<head>Chapter 25.—How Powerfully the Evil Spirits Incite Men to Wicked Actions, by
Giving Them the Quasi-Divine Authority of Their Example.</head>
<p>Now, who does not hereby comprehend,—unless he has preferred to imitate such gods
rather than by divine grace to withdraw himself from their fellowship,—who does not see
how eagerly these evil spirits strive by their example to lend, as it were, divine authority to
crime? Is not this proved by the fact that they were seen in a wide plain in Campania rehearsing
among themselves the battle which shortly after took place there with great
bloodshed between the armies of Rome? For at first there were heard loud crashing noises,
and afterwards many reported that they had seen for some days together two armies engaged.
And when this battle ceased, they found the ground all indented with just such footprints
of men and horses as a great conflict would leave. If, then, the deities were veritably fighting
with one another, the civil wars of men are sufficiently justified; yet, by the way, let it be
observed that such pugnacious gods must be very wicked or very wretched. If, however, it
was but a sham-fight, what did they intend by this, but that the civil wars of the Romans
should seem no wickedness, but an imitation of the gods? For already the civil wars had
begun; and before this, some lamentable battles and execrable massacres had occurred.
Already many had been moved by the story of the soldier, who, on stripping the spoils of
his slain foe, recognized in the stripped corpse his own brother, and, with deep curses on
civil wars, slew himself there and then on his brother’s body. To disguise the bitterness of
such tragedies, and kindle increasing ardor in this monstrous warfare, these malign demons,
who were reputed and worshipped as gods, fell upon this plan of revealing themselves in a
state of civil war, that no compunction for fellow-citizens might cause the Romans to shrink
from such battles, but that the human criminality might be justified by the divine example.
By a like craft, too, did these evil spirits command that scenic entertainments, of which I
have already spoken, should be instituted and dedicated to them. And in these entertainments
the poetical compositions and actions of the drama ascribed such iniquities to the gods, that
every one might safely imitate them, whether he believed the gods had actually done such
things, or, not believing this, yet perceived that they most eagerly desired to be represented
as having done them. And that no one might suppose, that in representing the gods as
fighting with one another, the poets had slandered them, and imputed to them unworthy
actions, the gods themselves, to complete the deception, confirmed the compositions of the
poets by exhibiting their own battles to the eyes of men, not only through actions in the
theatres, but in their own persons on the actual field.</p>
<p>We have been forced to bring forward these facts, because their authors have not scrupled
to say and to write that the Roman republic had already been ruined by the depraved moral
habits of the citizens, and had ceased to exist before the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Now this ruin they do not impute to their own gods, though they impute to our Christ the
evils of this life, which cannot ruin good men, be they alive or dead. And this they do,

<pb n="108"/>
though our Christ has issued so many precepts inculcating virtue and restraining vice; while
their own gods have done nothing whatever to preserve that republic that served them, and
to restrain it from ruin by such precepts, but have rather hastened its destruction, by cor-
rupting its morality through their pestilent example. No one, I fancy, will now be bold
enough to say that the republic was then ruined because of the departure of the gods “from
each fane, each sacred shrine,” as if they were the friends of virtue, and were offended by
the vices of men. No, there are too many presages from entrails, auguries, soothsayings,
whereby they boastingly proclaimed themselves prescient of future events and controllers
of the fortune of war,—all which prove them to have been present. And had they been indeed
absent the Romans would never in these civil wars have been so far transported by their
own passions as they were by the instigations of these gods.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—That the Demons Gave in Secret Certain Obscure Instructions in
Morals, While in Public Their Own Solemnities Inculcated All Wickedness.</head>
<p>Seeing that this is so,—seeing that the filthy and cruel deeds, the disgraceful and criminal
actions of the gods, whether real or feigned, were at their own request published, and
were consecrated, and dedicated in their honor as sacred and stated solemnities; seeing they
vowed vengeance on those who refused to exhibit them to the eyes of all, that they might
be proposed as deeds worthy of imitation, why is it that these same demons, who by taking
pleasure in such obscenities, acknowledge themselves to be unclean spirits, and by delighting
in their own villanies and iniquities, real or imaginary, and by requesting from the immodest,
and extorting from the modest, the celebration of these licentious acts, proclaim themselves
instigators to a criminal and lewd life;—why, I ask, are they represented as giving some good
moral precepts to a few of their own elect, initiated in the secrecy of their shrines? If it be
so, this very thing only serves further to demonstrate the malicious craft of these pestilent
spirits. For so great is the influence of probity and chastity, that all men, or almost all men,
are moved by the praise of these virtues; nor is any man so depraved by vice, but he hath
some feeling of honor left in him. So that, unless the devil sometimes transformed himself,
as Scripture says, into an angel of light,115 he could not compass his deceitful purpose.
Accordingly, in public, a bold impurity fills the ear of the people with noisy clamor; in
private, a feigned chastity speaks in scarce audible whispers to a few: an open stage is
provided for shameful things, but on the praiseworthy the curtain falls: grace hides disgrace
flaunts: a wicked deed draws an overflowing house, a virtuous speech finds scarce a hearer,
as though purity were to be blushed at, impurity boasted of. Where else can such confusion
reign, but in devils’ temples? Where, but in the haunts of deceit? For the secret precepts
are given as a sop to the virtuous, who are few in number; the wicked examples are exhibited
to encourage the vicious, who are countless.</p>
<p>Where and when those initiated in the mysteries of Coelestis received any good instructions,
we know not. What we do know is, that before her shrine, in which her image is set,
and amidst a vast crowd gathering from all quarters, and standing closely packed together,
we were intensely interested spectators of the games which were going on, and saw, as we
pleased to turn the eye, on this side a grand display of harlots, on the other the virgin goddess;
we saw this virgin worshipped with prayer and with obscene rites. There we saw no shamefaced
mimes, no actress over-burdened with modesty; all that the obscene rites demanded
was fully complied with. We were plainly shown what was pleasing to the virgin deity, and
the matron who witnessed the spectacle returned home from the temple a wiser woman.
Some, indeed, of the more prudent women turned their faces from the immodest movements
of the players, and learned the art of wickedness by a furtive regard. For they were restrained,
<note type="footnote">115 2 Cor. xi. 14.</note>

<pb n="110"/>
by the modest demeanor due to men, from looking boldly at the immodest gestures; but
much more were they restrained from condemning with chaste heart the sacred rites of her
whom they adored. And yet this licentiousness—which, if practised in one’s home, could
only be done there in secret—was practised as a public lesson in the temple; and if any
modesty remained in men, it was occupied in marvelling that wickedness which men could
not unrestrainedly commit should be part of the religious teaching of the gods, and that to
omit its exhibition should incur the anger of the gods. What spirit can that be, which by a
hidden inspiration stirs men’s corruption, and goads them to adultery, and feeds on the
full-fledged iniquity, unless it be the same that finds pleasure in such religious ceremonies,
sets in the temples images of devils, and loves to see in play the images of vices; that whispers
in secret some righteous sayings to deceive the few who are good, and scatters in public invitations
to profligacy, to gain possession of the millions who are wicked?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—That the Obscenities of Those Plays Which the Romans Consecrated
in Order to Propitiate Their Gods, Contributed Largely to the Overthrow of
Public Order.</head>
<p>Cicero, a weighty man, and a philosopher in his way, when about to be made edile,
wished the citizens to understand116 that, among the other duties of his magistracy, he must
propitiate Flora by the celebration of games. And these games are reckoned devout in proportion
to their lewdness. In another place,117 and when he was now consul, and the state
in great peril, he says that games had been celebrated for ten days together, and that nothing
had been omitted which could pacify the gods: as if it had not been more satisfactory to irritate
the gods by temperance, than to pacify them by debauchery; and to provoke their hate
by honest living, than soothe it by such unseemly grossness. For no matter how cruel was
the ferocity of those men who were threatening the state, and on whose account the gods
were being propitiated, it could not have been more hurtful than the alliance of gods who
were won with the foulest vices. To avert the danger which threatened men’s bodies, the
gods were conciliated in a fashion that drove virtue from their spirits; and the gods did not
enrol themselves as defenders of the battlements against the besiegers, until they had first
stormed and sacked the morality of the citizens. This propitiation of such divinities,—a
propitiation so wanton, so impure, so immodest, so wicked, so filthy, whose actors the innate
and praiseworthy virtue of the Romans disabled from civic honors, erased from their tribe,
recognized as polluted and made infamous;—this propitiation, I say, so foul, so detestable,
and alien from every religious feeling, these fabulous and ensnaring accounts of the criminal
actions of the gods, these scandalous actions which they either shamefully and wickedly
committed, or more shamefully and wickedly feigned, all this the whole city learned in
public both by the words and gestures of the actors. They saw that the gods delighted in
the commission of these things, and therefore believed that they wished them not only to
be exhibited to them, but to be imitated by themselves. But as for that good and honest instruction
which they speak of, it was given in such secrecy, and to so few (if indeed given at
all), that they seemed rather to fear it might be divulged, than that it might not be practised.</p>

<p>They, then, are but abandoned and ungrateful wretches, in deep and fast bondage to
that malign spirit, who complain and murmur that men are rescued by the name of Christ
from the hellish thraldom of these unclean spirits, and from a participation in their punishment,
and are brought out of the night of pestilential ungodliness into the light of most
healthful piety. Only such men could murmur that the masses flock to the churches and
their chaste acts of worship, where a seemly separation of the sexes is observed; where they
learn how they may so spend this earthly life, as to merit a blessed eternity hereafter; where
Holy Scripture and instruction in righteousness are proclaimed from a raised platform in
presence of all, that both they who do the word may hear to their salvation, and they who
do it not may hear to judgment. And though some enter who scoff at such precepts, all
their petulance is either quenched by a sudden change, or is restrained through fear or
shame. For no filthy and wicked action is there set forth to be gazed at or to be imitated;
but either the precepts of the true God are recommended, His miracles narrated, His gifts
praised, or His benefits implored.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—An Exhortation to the Romans to Renounce Paganism.</head>
<p>This, rather, is the religion worthy of your desires, O admirable Roman race,—the
progeny of your Scævolas and Scipios, of Regulus, and of Fabricius. This rather covet, this
distinguish from that foul vanity and crafty malice of the devils. If there is in your nature
any eminent virtue, only by true piety is it purged and perfected, while by impiety it is
wrecked and punished. Choose now what you will pursue, that your praise may be not in
yourself, but in the true God, in whom is no error. For of popular glory you have had your
share; but by the secret providence of God, the true religion was not offered to your choice.
Awake, it is now day; as you have already awaked in the persons of some in whose perfect
virtue and sufferings for the true faith we glory: for they, contending on all sides with hostile
powers, and conquering them all by bravely dying, have purchased for us this country of
ours with their blood; to which country we invite you, and exhort you to add yourselves to
the number of the citizens of this city, which also has a sanctuary118 of its own in the true
remission of sins. Do not listen to those degenerate sons of thine who slander Christ and
Christians, and impute to them these disastrous times, though they desire times in which
they may enjoy rather impunity for their wickedness than a peaceful life. Such has never
been Rome’s ambition even in regard to her earthly country. Lay hold now on the celestial
country, which is easily won, and in which you will reign truly and for ever. For there shall
thou find no vestal fire, no Capitoline stone, but the one true God.</p>
<p>“No date, no goal will here ordain:</p>
<p>But grant an endless, boundless reign.”119</p>
<p>No longer, then, follow after false and deceitful gods; abjure them rather, and despise
them, bursting forth into true liberty. Gods they are not, but malignant spirits, to whom
your eternal happiness will be a sore punishment. Juno, from whom you deduce your origin
according to the flesh, did not so bitterly grudge Rome’s citadels to the Trojans, as these
devils whom yet ye repute gods, grudge an everlasting seat to the race of mankind. And
thou thyself hast in no wavering voice passed judgment on them, when thou didst pacify
them with games, and yet didst account as infamous the men by whom the plays were acted.
Suffer us, then, to assert thy freedom against the unclean spirits who had imposed on thy
neck the yoke of celebrating their own shame and filthiness. The actors of these divine
crimes thou hast removed from offices of honor; supplicate the true God, that He may remove
from thee those gods who delight in their crimes,—a most disgraceful thing if the crimes
are really theirs, and a most malicious invention if the crimes are feigned. Well done, in
that thou hast spontaneously banished from the number of your citizens all actors and

players. Awake more fully: the majesty of God cannot be propitiated by that which defiles
the dignity of man. How, then, can you believe that gods who take pleasure in such lewd
plays, belong to the number of the holy powers of heaven, when the men by whom these
plays are acted are by yourselves refused admission into the number of Roman citizens even
of the lowest grade? Incomparably more glorious than Rome, is that heavenly city in which
for victory you have truth; for dignity, holiness; for peace, felicity; for life, eternity. Much
less does it admit into its society such gods, if thou dost blush to admit into thine such men.
Wherefore, if thou wouldst attain to the blessed city, shun the society of devils. They who
are propitiated by deeds of shame, are unworthy of the worship of right-hearted men. Let
these, then, be obliterated from your worship by the cleansing of the Christian religion, as
those men were blotted from your citizenship by the censor’s mark.</p>
<p>But, so far as regards carnal benefits, which are the only blessings the wicked desire to
enjoy, and carnal miseries, which alone they shrink from enduring, we will show in the following
book that the demons have not the power they are supposed to have; and although
they had it, we ought rather on that account to despise these blessings, than for the sake of
them to worship those gods, and by worshipping them to miss the attainment of these

<head>Chapter 1.—Of the Ills Which Alone the Wicked Fear, and Which the World Continually
Suffered, Even When the Gods Were Worshipped.</head>
<p>Of moral and spiritual evils, which are above all others to be deprecated, I think enough
has already been said to show that the false gods took no steps to prevent the people who
worshipped them from being overwhelmed by such calamities, but rather aggravated the
ruin. I see I must now speak of those evils which alone are dreaded by the heathen—famine,
pestilence, war, pillage, captivity, massacre, and the like calamities, already enumerated in
the first book. For evil men account those things alone evil which do not make men evil;
neither do they blush to praise good things, and yet to remain evil among the good things
they praise. It grieves them more to own a bad house than a bad life, as if it were man’s
greatest good to have everything good but himself. But not even such evils as were alone
dreaded by the heathen were warded off by their gods, even when they were most unrestrictedly
worshipped. For in various times and places before the advent of our Redeemer,
the human race was crushed with numberless and sometimes incredible calamities; and at
that time what gods but those did the world worship, if you except the one nation of the
Hebrews, and, beyond them, such individuals as the most secret and most just judgment of
God counted worthy of divine grace?120 But that I may not be prolix, I will be silent regarding
the heavy calamities that have been suffered by any other nations, and will speak only of
what happened to Rome and the Roman empire, by which I mean Rome properly so called,
and those lands which already, before the coming of Christ, had by alliance or conquest
become, as it were, members of the body of the state.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Whether the Gods, Whom the Greeks and Romans Worshipped in
Common, Were Justified in Permitting the Destruction of Ilium.</head>
<p>First, then, why was Troy or Ilium, the cradle of the Roman people (for I must not
overlook nor disguise what I touched upon in the first book121), conquered, taken and
destroyed by the Greeks, though it esteemed and worshipped the same gods as they? Priam,
some answer, paid the penalty of the perjury of his father Laomedon.122 Then it is true that
Laomedon hired Apollo and Neptune as his workmen. For the story goes that he promised
them wages, and then broke his bargain. I wonder that famous diviner Apollo toiled at so
huge a work, and never suspected Laomedon was going to cheat him of his pay. And Neptune
too, his uncle, brother of Jupiter, king of the sea, it really was not seemly that he should be
ignorant of what was to happen. For he is introduced by Homer123 (who lived and wrote
before the building of Rome) as predicting something great of the posterity of Æneas, who
in fact founded Rome. And as Homer says, Nep tune also rescued Æneas in a cloud from
the wrath of Achilles, though (according to Virgil124)
<lg>
<l>“All his will was to destroy</l>
<l>His own creation, perjured Troy.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Gods, then, so great as Apollo and Neptune, in ignorance of the cheat that was to defraud
them of their wages, built the walls of Troy for nothing but thanks and thankless people.125
There may be some doubt whether it is not a worse crime to believe such persons to be gods,
than to cheat such gods. Even Homer himself did not give full credence to the story for
while he represents Neptune, indeed, as hostile to the Trojans, he introduces Apollo as their
champion, though the story implies that both were offended by that fraud. If, therefore,
they believe their fables, let them blush to worship such gods; if they discredit the fables, let
no more be said of the “Trojan perjury;” or let them explain how the gods hated Trojan, but
loved Roman perjury. For how did the conspiracy of Catiline, even in so large and corrupt
a city, find so abundant a supply of men whose hands and tongues found them a living by
perjury and civic broils? What else but perjury corrupted the judgments pronounced by so
many of the senators? What else corrupted the people’s votes and decisions of all causes
tried before them? For it seems that the ancient practice of taking oaths has been preserved
even in the midst of the greatest corruption, not for the sake of restraining wickedness by
religious fear, but to complete the tale of crimes by adding that of perjury.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—That the Gods Could Not Be Offended by the Adultery of Paris, This
Crime Being So Common Among Themselves.</head>
<p>There is no ground, then, for representing the gods (by whom, as they say, that empire
stood, though they are proved to have been conquered by the Greeks) as being enraged at
the Trojan perjury. Neither, as others again plead in their defence, was it indignation at the
adultery of Paris that caused them to withdraw their protection from Troy. For their habit
is to be instigators and instructors in vice, not its avengers. “The city of Rome,” says Sallust,
“was first built and inhabited, as I have heard, by the Trojans, who, flying their country,
under the conduct of Æneas, wandered about without making any settlement.”126 If, then,
the gods were of opinion that the adultery of Paris should be punished, it was chiefly the
Romans, or at least the Romans also, who should have suffered; for the adultery was brought
about by Æneas’ mother. But how could they hate in Paris a crime which they made no
objection to in their own sister Venus, who (not to mention any other instance) committed
adultery with Anchises, and so became the mother of Æneas? Is it because in the one case
Menelaus127 was aggrieved, while in the other Vulcan128 connived at the crime? For the
gods, I fancy, are so little jealous of their wives, that they make no scruple of sharing them
with men. But perhaps I may be suspected of turning the myths into ridicule, and not
handling so weighty a subject with sufficient gravity. Well, then, let us say that Æneas is
not the son of Venus. I am willing to admit it; but is Romulus any more the son of Mars?
For why not the one as well as the other? Or is it lawful for gods to have intercourse with
women, unlawful for men to have intercourse with goddesses? A hard, or rather an incredible
condition, that what was allowed to Mars by the law of Venus, should not be allowed to
Venus herself by her own law. However, both cases have the authority of Rome; for Cæsar
in modern times believed no less that he was descended from Venus,129 than the ancient
Romulus believed himself the son of Mars.</p>

Offspring of the Gods.</head>
<p>Some one will say, But do you believe all this? Not I indeed. For even Varro, a very
learned heathen, all but admits that these stories are false, though he does not boldly and
confidently say so. But he maintains it is useful for states that brave men believe, though
falsely, that they are descended from the gods; for that thus the human spirit, cherishing
the belief of its divine descent, will both more boldly venture into great enterprises, and will
carry them out more energetically, and will therefore by its very confidence secure more
abundant success. You see how wide a field is opened to falsehood by this opinion of Varro’s,
which I have expressed as well as I could in my own words; and how comprehensible it is,
that many of the religions and sacred legends should be feigned in a community in which
it was judged profitable for the citizens that lies should be told even about the gods themselves.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—That It is Not Credible that the Gods Should Have Punished the Adultery
of Paris, Seeing They Showed No Indignation at the Adultery of the Mother of
Romulus.</head>
<p>But whether Venus could bear Æneas to a human father Anchises, or Mars beget Romulus
of the daughter of Numitor, we leave as unsettled questions. For our own Scriptures
suggest the very similar question, whether the fallen angels had sexual intercourse with the
daughters of men, by which the earth was at that time filled with giants, that is, with
enormously large and strong men. At present, then, I will limit my discussion to this dilemma:
If that which their books relate about the mother of Æneas and the father of Romulus
be true, how can the gods be displeased with men for adulteries which, when committed by
themselves, excite no displeasure? If it is false, not even in this case can the gods be angry
that men should really commit adulteries, which, even when falsely attributed to the gods,
they delight in. Moreover, if the adultery of Mars be discredited, that Venus also may be
freed from the imputation, then the mother of Romulus is left unshielded by the pretext of
a divine seduction. For Sylvia was a vestal priestess, and the gods ought to avenge this sacrilege
on the Romans with greater severity than Paris’ adultery on the Trojans. For even
the Romans themselves in primitive times used to go so far as to bury alive any vestal who
was detected in adultery, while women unconsecrated, though they were punished, were
never punished with death for that crime; and thus they more earnestly vindicated the
purity of shrines they esteemed divine, than of the human bed.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="121"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—That the Gods Exacted No Penalty for the Fratricidal Act of Romulus.</head>
<p>I add another instance: If the sins of men so greatly incensed those divinities, that they
abandoned Troy to fire and sword to punish the crime of Paris, the murder of Romulus’
brother ought to have incensed them more against the Romans than the cajoling of a Greek
husband moved them against the Trojans: fratricide in a newly-born city should have provoked
them more than adultery in a city already flourishing. It makes no difference to the
question we now discuss, whether Romulus ordered his brother to be slain, or slew him
with his own hand; it is a crime which many shamelessly deny, many through shame doubt,
many in grief disguise. And we shall not pause to examine and weigh the testimonies of
historical writers on the subject. All agree that the brother of Romulus was slain, not by
enemies, not by strangers. If it was Romulus who either commanded or perpetrated this
crime; Romulus was more truly the head of the Romans than Paris of the Trojans; why then
did he who carried off another man’s wife bring down the anger of the gods on the Trojans,
while he who took his brother’s life obtained the guardianship of those same gods? If, on
the other hand, that crime was not wrought either by the hand or will of Romulus, then the
whole city is chargeable with it, because it did not see to its punishment, and thus committed,
not fratricide, but parricide, which is worse. For both brothers were the founders of that
city, of which the one was by villainy prevented from being a ruler. So far as I see, then, no
evil can be ascribed to Troy which warranted the gods in abandoning it to destruction, nor
any good to Rome which accounts for the gods visiting it with prosperity; unless the truth
be, that they fled from Troy because they were vanquished, and betook themselves to Rome
to practise their characteristic deceptions there. Nevertheless they kept a footing for themselves
in Troy, that they might deceive future inhabitants who re-peopled these lands; while
at Rome, by a wider exercise of their malignant arts, they exulted in more abundant honors.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Of the Destruction of Ilium by Fimbria, a Lieutenant of Marius.</head>
<p>And surely we may ask what wrong poor Ilium had done, that, in the first heat of the
civil wars of Rome, it should suffer at the hand of Fimbria, the veriest villain among Marius’
partisans, a more fierce and cruel destruction than the Grecian sack.130 For when the Greeks
took it many escaped, and many who did not escape were suffered to live, though in captivity.
But Fimbria from the first gave orders that not a life should be spared, and burnt up together
the city and all its inhabitants. Thus was Ilium requited, not by the Greeks, whom she had
provoked by wrong-doing; but by the Romans, who had been built out of her ruins; while
the gods, adored alike of both sides, did simply nothing, or, to speak more correctly, could
do nothing. Is it then true, that at this time also, after Troy had repaired the damage done
by the Grecian fire, all the gods by whose help the kingdom stood, “forsook each fane, each
sacred shrine?”</p>
<p>But if so, I ask the reason; for in my judgment, the conduct of the gods was as much to
be reprobated as that of the townsmen to be applauded. For these closed their gates against
Fimbria, that they might preserve the city for Sylla, and were therefore burnt and consumed
by the enraged general. Now, up to this time, Sylla’s cause was the more worthy of the two;
for till now he used arms to restore the republic, and as yet his good intentions had met
with no reverses. What better thing, then, could the Trojans have done? What more honorable,
what more faithful to Rome, or more worthy of her relationship, than to preserve
their city for the better part of the Romans, and to shut their gates against a parricide of his
country? It is for the defenders of the gods to consider the ruin which this conduct brought
on Troy. The gods deserted an adulterous people, and abandoned Troy to the fires of the
Greeks, that out of her ashes a chaster Rome might arise. But why did they a second time
abandon this same town, allied now to Rome, and not making war upon her noble daughter,
but preserving a most steadfast and pious fidelity to Rome’s most justifiable faction? Why
did they give her up to be destroyed, not by the Greek heroes, but by the basest of the Romans?
Or, if the gods did not favor Sylla’s cause, for which the unhappy Trojans maintained
their city, why did they themselves predict and promise Sylla such successes? Must we call
them flatterers of the fortunate, rather than helpers of the wretched? Troy was not destroyed,
then, because the gods deserted it. For the demons, always watchful to deceive, did what
they could. For, when all the statues were overthrown and burnt together with the town,
Livy tells us that only the image of Minerva is said to have been found standing uninjured
amidst the ruins of her temple; not that it might be said in their praise, “The gods who made
this realm divine,” but that it might not be said in their defence, They are “gone from each
fane, each sacred shrine:” for that marvel was permitted to them, not that they might be
proved to be powerful, but that they might be convicted of being present.</p>

stormed Troy, the gods were already resident in Rome? How, then, did the image of Minerva
remain standing? Besides, if they were at Rome when Fimbria destroyed Troy, perhaps they
were at Troy when Rome itself was taken and set on fire by the Gauls. But as they are very

<head>Chapter 9.—Whether It is Credible that the Peace During the Reign of Numa Was
Brought About by the Gods.</head>
<p>It is also believed that it was by the help of the gods that the successor of Romulus, Numa
Pompilius, enjoyed peace during his entire reign, and shut the gates of Janus, which are
customarily kept open131 during war. And it is supposed he was thus requited for appointing
many religious observances among the Romans. Certainly that king would have commanded
our congratulations for so rare a leisure, had he been wise enough to spend it on wholesome
pursuits, and, subduing a pernicious curiosity, had sought out the true God with true piety.
But as it was, the gods were not the authors of his leisure; but possibly they would have deceived
him less had they found him busier. For the more disengaged they found him, the
more they themselves occupied his attention. Varro informs us of all his efforts, and of the
arts he employed to associate these gods with himself and the city; and in its own place, if
God will, I shall discuss these matters. Meanwhile, as we are speaking of the benefits conferred
by the gods, I readily admit that peace is a great benefit; but it is a benefit of the true
God, which, like the sun, the rain, and other supports of life, is frequently conferred on the
ungrateful and wicked. But if this great boon was conferred on Rome and Pompilius by
their gods, why did they never afterwards grant it to the Roman empire during even more
meritorious periods? Were the sacred rites more efficient at their first institution than
during their subsequent celebration? But they had no existence in Numa’s time, until he
added them to the ritual; whereas afterwards they had already been celebrated and preserved,
that benefit might arise from them. How, then, is it that those forty-three, or as others prefer
it, thirty-nine years of Numa’s reign, were passed in unbroken peace, and yet that afterwards,
when the worship was established, and the gods themselves, who were invoked by it, were
the recognized guardians and pa trons of the city, we can with difficulty find during the
whole period, from the building of the city to the reign of Augustus, one year—that, viz.,
which followed the close of the first Punic war—in which, for a marvel, the Romans were
able to shut the gates of war?132</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Whether It Was Desirable that The Roman Empire Should Be Increased
by Such a Furious Succession of Wars, When It Might Have Been Quiet and Safe
by Following in the Peaceful Ways of Numa.</head>
<p>Do they reply that the Roman empire could never have been so widely extended, nor
so glorious, save by constant and unintermitting wars? A fit argument, truly! Why must a
kingdom be distracted in order to be great? In this little world of man’s body, is it not better
to have a moderate stature, and health with it, than to attain the huge dimensions of a giant
by unnatural torments, and when you attain it to find no rest, but to be pained the more in
proportion to the size of your members? What evil would have resulted, or rather what
good would not have resulted, had those times continued which Sallust sketched, when he
says, “At first the kings (for that was the first title of empire in the world) were divided in
their sentiments: part cultivated the mind, others the body: at that time the life of men was
led without coveteousness; every one was sufficiently satisfied with his own!”133 Was it requisite,
then, for Rome’s prosperity, that the state of things which Virgil reprobates should
succeed:
<lg>
<l>“At length stole on a baser age</l>
<l>And war’s indomitable rage,</l>
<l>And greedy lust of gain?”134</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But obviously the Romans have a plausible defence for undertaking and carrying on
such disastrous wars,—to wit, that the pressure of their enemies forced them to resist, so
that they were compelled to fight, not by any greed of human applause, but by the necessity
of protecting life and liberty. Well, let that pass. Here is Sallust’s account of the matter:
“For when their state, enriched with laws, institutions, territory, seemed abundantly prosperous
and sufficiently powerful, according to the ordinary law of human nature, opulence
gave birth to envy. Accordingly, the neighboring kings and states took arms and assaulted
them. A few allies lent assistance; the rest, struck with fear, kept aloof from dangers. But
the Romans, watchful at home and in war, were active, made preparations, encouraged one
another, marched to meet their enemies,—protected by arms their liberty, country, parents.
Afterwards, when they had repelled the dangers by their bravery, they carried help to their
allies and friends, and procured alliances more by conferring than by receiving favors.”135
This was to build up Rome’s greatness by honorable means. But, in Numa’s reign, I would
know whether the long peace was maintained in spite of the incursions of wicked neighbors,
or if these incursions were discontinued that the peace might be maintained? For if even

then Rome was harassed by wars, and yet did not meet force with force, the same means
she then used to quiet her enemies without conquering them in war, or terrifying them with
the onset of battle, she might have used always, and have reigned in peace with the gates of
Janus shut. And if this was not in her power, then Rome enjoyed peace not at the will of
her gods, but at the will of her neighbors round about, and only so long as they cared to
provoke her with no war, unless perhaps these pitiful gods will dare to sell to one man as
their favor what lies not in their power to bestow, but in the will of another man. These
demons, indeed, in so far as they are permitted, can terrify or incite the minds of wicked
men by their own peculiar wickedness. But if they always had this power, and if no action
were taken against their efforts by a more secret and higher power, they would be supreme
to give peace or the victories of war, which almost always fall out through some human
emotion, and frequently in opposition to the will of the gods, as is proved not only by lying
legends, which scarcely hint or signify any grain of truth, but even by Roman history itself.</p>

Apollo, who is said to have wept for four days during the war with the Achæans and King
Aristonicus. And when the augurs were alarmed at the portent, and had determined to cast
the statue into the sea, the old men of Cumæ interposed, and related that a similar prodigy
had occurred to the same image during the wars against Antiochus and against Perseus,
and that by a decree of the senate, gifts had been presented to Apollo, because the event
had proved favorable to the Romans. Then soothsayers were summoned who were supposed
to have greater professional skill, and they pronounced that the weeping of Apollo’s image
was propitious to the Romans, because Cumæ was a Greek colony, and that Apollo was
bewailing (and thereby presaging) the grief and calamity that was about to light upon his
own land of Greece, from which he had been brought. Shortly afterwards it was reported
that King Aristonicus was defeated and made prisoner,—a defeat certainly opposed to the
will of Apollo; and this he indicated by even shedding tears from his marble image. And
this shows us that, though the verses of the poets are mythical, they are not altogether devoid
of truth, but describe the manners of the demons in a sufficiently fit style. For in Virgil,
Diana mourned for Camilla,136 and Hercules wept for Pallas doomed to die.137 This is
perhaps the reason why Numa Pompilius, too, when, enjoying prolonged peace, but without
knowing or inquiring from whom he received it, he began in his leisure to consider to what
gods he should entrust the safe keeping and conduct of Rome, and not dreaming that the
true, almighty, and most high God cares for earthly affairs, but recollecting only that the
Trojan gods which Æneas had brought to Italy had been able to preserve neither the Trojan
nor Lavinian kingdom rounded by Æneas himself, concluded that he must provide other
gods as guardians of fugitives and helpers of the weak, and add them to those earlier divinities
who had either come over to Rome with Romulus, or when Alba was destroyed.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—That the Romans Added a Vast Number of Gods to Those Introduced
by Numa, and that Their Numbers Helped Them Not at All.</head>
<p>But though Pompilius introduced so ample a ritual, yet did not Rome see fit to be content
with it. For as yet Jupiter himself had not his chief temple,—it being King Tarquin who
built the Capitol. And Æsculapius left Epidaurus for Rome, that in this foremost city he
might have a finer field for the exercise of his great medical skill.138 The mother of the gods,
too, came I know not whence from Pessinuns; it being unseemly that, while her son presided
on the Capitoline hill, she herself should lie hid in obscurity. But if she is the mother of all
the gods, she not only followed some of her children to Rome, but left others to follow her.
I wonder, indeed, if she were the mother of Cynocephalus, who a long while afterwards
came from Egypt. Whether also the goddess Fever was her offspring, is a matter for her
grandson Æsculapius139 to decide. But of whatever breed she be, the foreign gods will not
presume, I trust, to call a goddess base-born who is a Roman citizen. Who can number the
deities to whom the guardianship of Rome was entrusted? Indigenous and imported, both
of heaven, earth, hell, seas, fountains, rivers; and, as Varro says, gods certain and uncertain,
male and female: for, as among animals, so among all kinds of gods are there these distinctions.
Rome, then, enjoying the protection of such a cloud of deities, might surely have
been preserved from some of those great and horrible calamities, of which I can mention
but a few. For by the great smoke of her altars she summoned to her protection, as by a
beacon-fire, a host of gods, for whom she appointed and maintained temples, altars, sacrifices,
priests, and thus offended the true and most high God, to whom alone all this ceremonial
is lawfully due. And, indeed, she was more prosperous when she had fewer gods; but the
greater she became, the more gods she thought she should have, as the larger ship needs to
be manned by a larger crew. I suppose she despaired of the smaller number, under whose
protection she had spent comparatively happy days, being able to defend her greatness. For
even under the kings (with the exception of Numa Pompilius, of whom I have already
spoken), how wicked a contentiousness must have existed to occasion the death of Romulus’
brother!</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—By What Right or Agreement The Romans Obtained Their First Wives.
How is it that neither Juno, who with her husband Jupiter even then cherished
“Rome’s sons, the nation of the gown,”140</head>
<p>nor Venus herself, could assist the children of the loved Æneas to find wives by some
right and equitable means? For the lack of this entailed upon the Romans the lamentable
necessity of stealing their wives, and then waging war with their fathers-in-law; so that the
wretched women, before they had recovered from the wrong done them by their husbands,
were dowried with the blood of their fathers. “But the Romans conquered their neighbors.”
Yes; but with what wounds on both sides, and with what sad slaughter of relatives and
neighbors! The war of Cæsar and Pompey was the contest of only one father-in-law with
one son-in-law; and before it began, the daughter of Cæsar, Pompey’s wife, was already
dead. But with how keen and just an accent of grief does Lucan141 exclaim: “I sing that
worse than civil war waged in the plains of Emathia, and in which the crime was justified
by the victory!”</p>
<p>The Romans, then, conquered that they might, with hands stained in the blood of their
fathers-in-law, wrench the miserable girls from their embrace,—girls who dared not weep
for their slain parents, for fear of offending their victorious husbands; and while yet the
battle was raging, stood with their prayers on their lips, and knew not for whom to utter
them. Such nuptials were certainly prepared for the Roman people not by Venus, but Bellona;
or possibly that infernal fury Alecto had more liberty to injure them now that Juno was
aiding them, than when the prayers of that goddess had excited her against Æneas. Andromache
in captivity was happier than these Roman brides. For though she was a slave,
yet, after she had become the wife of Pyrrhus, no more Trojans fell by his hand; but the
Romans slew in battle the very fathers of the brides they fondled. Andromache, the victor’s
captive, could only mourn, not fear, the death of her people. The Sabine women, related to
men still combatants, feared the death of their fathers when their husbands went out to
battle, and mourned their death as they returned, while neither their grief nor their fear
could be freely expressed. For the victories of their husbands, involving the destruction of
fellow-townsmen, relatives, brothers, fathers, caused either pious agony or cruel exultation.
Moreover, as the fortune of war is capricious, some of them lost their husbands by the sword
of their parents, while others lost husband and father together in mutual destruction. For
the Romans by no means escaped with impunity, but they were driven back within their
walls, and defended themselves behind closed gates; and when the gates were opened by
guile, and the enemy admitted into the town, the Forum itself was the field of a hateful and
<note type="footnote">140 Virgil, Æn. i. 286.</note>
<note type="footnote">141 Pharsal. v. 1.</note>

<pb n="130"/>
fierce engagement of fathers-in-law and sons-in-law. The ravishers were indeed quite defeated,
and, flying on all sides to their houses, sullied with new shame their original shameful
and lamentable triumph. It was at this juncture that Romulus, hoping no more from the
valor of his citizens, prayed Jupiter that they might stand their ground; and from this occasion
the god gained the name of Stator. But not even thus would the mischief have been finished,
had not the ravished women themselves flashed out with dishevelled hair, and cast themselves
before their parents, and thus disarmed their just rage, not with the arms of victory, but
with the supplications of filial affection. Then Romulus, who could not brook his own
brother as a colleague, was compelled to accept Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, as his
partner on the throne. But how long would he who misliked the fellowship of his own twinbrother
endure a stranger? So, Tatius being slain, Romulus remained sole king, that he
might be the greater god. See what rights of marriage these were that fomented unnatural
wars. These were the Roman leagues of kindred, relationship, alliance, religion. This was
the life of the city so abundantly protected by the gods. You see how many severe things
might be said on this theme; but our purpose carries us past them, and requires our discourse
for other matters.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Wickedness of the War Waged by the Romans Against the Albans,
and of the Victories Won by the Lust of Power.</head>
<p>But what happened after Numa’s reign, and under the other kings, when the Albans
were provoked into war, with sad results not to themselves alone, but also to the Romans?
The long peace of Numa had become tedious; and with what endless slaughter and detriment
of both states did the Roman and Alban armies bring it to an end! For Alba, which had
been founded by Ascanius, son of Æneas, and which was more properly the mother of Rome
than Troy herself, was provoked to battle by Tullus Hostilius, king of Rome, and in the
conflict both inflicted and received such damage, that at length both parties wearied of the
struggle. It was then devised that the war should be decided by the combat of three twinbrothers
from each army: from the Romans the three Horatii stood forward, from the Albans
the three Curiatii. Two of the Horatii were overcome and disposed of by the Curiatii; but
by the remaining Horatius the three Curiatii were slain. Thus Rome remained victorious,
but with such a sacrifice that only one survivor returned to his home. Whose was the loss
on both sides? Whose the grief, but of the offspring of Æneas, the descendants of Ascanius,
the progeny of Venus, the grandsons of Jupiter? For this, too, was a “worse than civil” war,
in which the belligerent states were mother and daughter. And to this combat of the three
twin-brothers there was added another atrocious and horrible catastrophe. For as the two
nations had formerly been friendly (being related and neighbors), the sister of the Horatii
had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii; and she, when she saw her brother wearing the
spoils of her betrothed, burst into tears, and was slain by her own brother in his anger. To
me, this one girl seems to have been more humane than the whole Roman people. I cannot
think her to blame for lamenting the man to whom already she had plighted her troth, or,
as perhaps she was doing, for grieving that her brother should have slain him to whom he
had promised his sister. For why do we praise the grief of Æneas (in Virgil142) over the
enemy cut down even by his own hand? Why did Marcellus shed tears over the city of
Syracuse, when he recollected, just before he destroyed, its magnificence and meridian glory,
and thought upon the common lot of all things? I demand, in the name of humanity, that
if men are praised for tears shed over enemies conquered by themselves, a weak girl should
not be counted criminal for bewailing her lover slaughtered by the hand of her brother.
While, then, that maiden was weeping for the death of her betrothed inflicted by her
brother’s hand, Rome was rejoicing that such devastation had been wrought on her mother
state, and that she had purchased a victory with such an expenditure of the common blood
of herself and the Albans.</p>

<pb n="131"/>
<p>Why allege to me the mere names and words of “glory” and “victory?” Tear off the
disguise of wild delusion, and look at the naked deeds: weigh them naked, judge them naked.
Let the charge be brought against Alba, as Troy was charged with adultery. There is no such
charge, none like it found: the war was kindled only in order that there
<lg>
<l>“Might sound in languid ears the cry</l>
<l>Of Tullus and of victory.”143</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>This vice of restless ambition was the sole motive to that social and parricidal war,—a
vice which Sallust brands in passing; for when he has spoken with brief but hearty commendation
of those primitive times in which life was spent without covetousness, and every one
was sufficiently satisfied with what he had, he goes on: “But after Cyrus in Asia, and the
Lacedemonians and Athenians in Greece, began to subdue cities and nations, and to account
the lust of sovereignty a sufficient ground for war, and to reckon that the greatest glory
consisted in the greatest empire;”144 and so on, as I need not now quote. This lust of sovereignty
disturbs and consumes the human race with frightful ills. By this lust Rome was
overcome when she triumphed over Alba, and praising her own crime, called it glory. For,
as our Scriptures say, “the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous,
whom the Lord abhorreth.”145 Away, then, with these deceitful masks, these deluding
whitewashes, that things may be truthfully seen and scrutinized. Let no man tell me that
this and the other was a “great” man, because he fought and conquered so and so. Gladiators
fight and conquer, and this barbarism has its meed of praise; but I think it were better to
take the consequences of any sloth, than to seek the glory won by such arms. And if two
gladiators entered the arena to fight, one being father, the other his son, who would endure
such a spectacle? who would not be revolted by it? How, then, could that be a glorious war
which a daughter-state waged against its mother? Or did it constitute a difference, that the
battlefield was not an arena, and that the wide plains were filled with the carcasses not of
two gladiators, but of many of the flower of two nations; and that those contests were viewed
not by the amphitheatre, but by the whole world, and furnished a profane spectacle both to
those alive at the time, and to their posterity, so long as the fame of it is handed down?</p>
<p>Yet those gods, guardians of the Roman empire, and, as it were, theatric spectators of
such contests as these, were not satisfied until the sister of the Horatii was added by her
brother’s sword as a third victim from the Roman side, so that Rome herself, though she
won the day, should have as many deaths to mourn. Afterwards, as a fruit of the victory,
Alba was destroyed, though it was there the Trojan gods had formed a third asylum after
Ilium had been sacked by the Greeks, and after they had left Lavinium, where Æneas had

founded a kingdom in a land of banishment. But probably Alba was destroyed because
from it too the gods had migrated, in their usual fashion, as Virgil says:
<lg>
<l>“Gone from each fane, each sacred shrine,</l>
<l>Are those who made this realm divine.”146</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Gone, indeed, and from now their third asylum, that Rome might seem all the wiser in
committing herself to them after they had deserted three other cities. Alba, whose king
Amulius had banished his brother, displeased them; Rome, whose king Romulus had slain
his brother, pleased them. But before Alba was destroyed, its population, they say, was
amalgamated with the inhabitants of Rome so that the two cities were one. Well, admitting
it was so, yet the fact remains that the city of Ascanius, the third retreat of the Trojan gods,
was destroyed by the daughter-city. Besides, to effect this pitiful conglomerate of the war’s
leavings, much blood was spilt on both sides. And how shall I speak in detail of the same
wars, so often renewed in subsequent reigns, though they seemed to have been finished by
great victories; and of wars that time after time were brought to an end by great slaughters,
and which yet time after time were renewed by the posterity of those who had made peace
and struck treaties? Of this calamitous history we have no small proof, in the fact that no
subsequent king closed the gates of war; and therefore with all their tutelar gods, no one of
them reigned in peace.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—What Manner of Life and Death the Roman Kings Had.</head>
<p>And what was the end of the kings themselves? Of Romulus, a flattering legend tells us
that he was assumed into heaven. But certain Roman historians relate that he was torn in
pieces by the senate for his ferocity, and that a man, Julius Proculus, was suborned to give
out that Romulus had appeared to him, and through him commanded the Roman people
to worship him as a god; and that in this way the people, who were beginning to resent the
action of the senate, were quieted and pacified. For an eclipse of the sun had also happened;
and this was attributed to the divine power of Romulus by the ignorant multitude, who did
not know that it was brought about by the fixed laws of the sun’s course: though this grief
of the sun might rather have been considered proof that Romulus had been slain, and that
the crime was indicated by this deprivation of the sun’s light; as, in truth, was the case when
the Lord was crucified through the cruelty and impiety of the Jews. For it is sufficiently
demonstrated that this latter obscuration of the sun did not occur by the natural laws of the
heavenly bodies, because it was then the Jewish Passover, which is held only at full moon,
whereas natural eclipses of the sun happen only at the last quarter of the moon. Cicero, too,
shows plainly enough that the apotheosis of Romulus was imaginary rather than real, when,
even while he is praising him in one of Scipio’s remarks in the De Republica, he says: “Such
a reputation had he acquired, that when he suddenly disappeared during an eclipse of the
sun, he was supposed to have been assumed into the number of the gods, which could be
supposed of no mortal who had not the highest reputation for virtue.”147 By these words,
“he suddenly disappeared,” we are to understand that he was mysteriously made away with
by the violence either of the tempest or of a murderous assault. For their other writers speak
not only of an eclipse, but of a sudden storm also, which certainly either afforded opportunity
for the crime, or itself made an end of Romulus. And of Tullus Hostilius, who was the third
king of Rome, and who was himself destroyed by lightning, Cicero in the same book says,
that “he was not supposed to have been deified by this death, possibly because the Romans
were unwilling to vulgarize the promotion they were assured or persuaded of in the case of
Romulus, lest they should bring it into contempt by gratuitously assigning it to all and
sundry.” In one of his invectives,148 too, he says, in round terms, “The founder of this city,
Romulus, we have raised to immortality and divinity by kindly celebrating his services;”
implying that his deification was not real, but reputed, and called so by courtesy on account
of his virtues. In the dialogue Hortensius, too, while speaking of the regular eclipses of the
sun, he says that they “produce the same darkness as covered the death of Romulus, which
happened during an eclipse of the sun.” Here you see he does not at all shrink from speaking
of his “death,” for Cicero was more of a reasoner than an eulogist.</p>
<note type="footnote">147 Cicero, De Rep. ii. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">148 Contra Cat.iii. 2.</note>

<pb n="135"/>
<p>The other kings of Rome, too, with the exception of Numa Pompilius and Ancus Marcius,
who died natural deaths, what horrible ends they had! Tullus Hostilius, the conqueror and
destroyer of Alba, was, as I said, himself and all his house consumed by lightning. Priscus
Tarquinius was slain by his predecessor’s sons. Servius Tullius was foully murdered by his
son-in-law Tarquinius Superbus, who succeeded him on the throne. Nor did so flagrant a
parricide committed against Rome’s best king drive from their altars and shrines those gods
who were said to have been moved by Paris’ adultery to treat poor Troy in this style, and
abandon it to the fire and sword of the Greeks. Nay, the very Tarquin who had murdered,
was allowed to succeed his father-in-law. And this infamous parricide, during the reign he
had secured by murder, was allowed to triumph in many victorious wars, and to build the
Capitol from their spoils; the gods meanwhile not departing, but abiding, and abetting, and
suffering their king Jupiter to preside and reign over them in that very splendid Capitol, the
work of a parricide. For he did not build the Capitol in the days of his innocence, and then
suffer banishment for subsequent crimes; but to that reign during which he built the Capitol,
he won his way by unnatural crime. And when he was afterwards banished by the Romans,
and forbidden the city, it was not for his own but his son’s wickedness in the affair of Lucretia,—
a crime perpetrated not only without his cognizance, but in his absence. For at that
time he was besieging Ardea, and fighting Rome’s battles; and we cannot say what he would
have done had he been aware of his son’s crime. Notwithstanding, though his opinion was
neither inquired into nor ascertained, the people stripped him of royalty; and when he returned
to Rome with his army, it was admitted, but he was excluded, abandoned by his
troops, and the gates shut in his face. And yet, after he had appealed to the neighboring
states, and tormented the Romans with calamitous but unsuccessful wars, and when he was
deserted by the ally on whom he most depended, despairing of regaining the kingdom, he
lived a retired and quiet life for fourteen years, as it is reported, in Tusculum, a Roman town,
where he grew old in his wife’s company, and at last terminated his days in a much more
desirable fashion than his father-in-law, who had perished by the hand of his son-in-law;
his own daughter abetting, if report be true. And this Tarquin the Romans called, not the
Cruel, nor the Infamous, but the Proud; their own pride perhaps resenting his tyrannical
airs. So little did they make of his murdering their best king, his own father-in-law, that
they elected him their own king. I wonder if it was not even more criminal in them to reward
so bountifully so great a criminal. And yet there was no word of the gods abandoning the
altars; unless, perhaps, some one will say in defence of the gods, that they remained at Rome
for the purpose of punishing the Romans, rather than of aiding and profiting them, seducing
them by empty victories, and wearing them out by severe wars. Such was the life of the
Romans under the kings during the much-praised epoch of the state which extends to the
expulsion of Tarquinius Superbus in the 243d year, during which all those victories, which
were bought with so much blood and such disasters, hardly pushed Rome’s dominion twenty

<head>Chapter 16.—Of the First Roman Consuls, the One of Whom Drove the Other from
the Country, and Shortly After Perished at Rome by the Hand of a Wounded
Enemy, and So Ended a Career of Unnatural Murders.</head>
<p>To this epoch let us add also that of which Sallust says, that it was ordered with justice
and moderation, while the fear of Tarquin and of a war with Etruria was impending. For
so long as the Etrurians aided the efforts of Tarquin to regain the throne, Rome was convulsed
with distressing war. And therefore he says that the state was ordered with justice and
moderation, through the pressure of fear, not through the influence of equity. And in this
very brief period, how calamitous a year was that in which consuls were first created, when
the kingly power was abolished! They did not fulfill their term of office. For Junius Brutus
deprived his colleague Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, and banished him from the city; and
shortly after he himself fell in battle, at once slaying and slain, having formerly put to death
his own sons and his brothers-in-law, because he had discovered that they were conspiring
to restore Tarquin. It is this deed that Virgil shudders to record, even while he seems to
praise it; for when he says:
<lg>
<l>“And call his own rebellious seed</l>
<l>For menaced liberty to bleed,”</l>
<l>he immediately exclaims,</l>
<l>“Unhappy father! howsoe’er</l>
<l>The deed be judged by after days;”</l>
</lg>
that is to say, let posterity judge the deed as they please, let them praise and extol the
father who slew his sons, he is unhappy. And then he adds, as if to console so unhappy a
man:
<lg>
<l>“His country’s love shall all o’erbear,</l>
<l>And unextinguished thirst of praise.”149</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>In the tragic end of Brutus, who slew his own sons, and though he slew his enemy,
Tarquin’s son, yet could not survive him, but was survived by Tarquin the elder, does not
the innocence of his colleague Collatinus seem to be vindicated, who, though a good citizen,
suffered the same punishment as Tarquin himself, when that tyrant was banished? For
Brutus himself is said to have been a relative150 of Tarquin. But Collatinus had the misfortune
to bear not only the blood, but the name of Tarquin. To change his name, then, not his
country, would have been his fit penalty: to abridge his name by this word, and be called
<note type="footnote">149 Æneid, vi. 820, etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">150 His nephew.</note>

<pb n="138"/>
simply L. Collatinus. But he was not com pelled to lose what he could lose without detriment,
but was stripped of the honor of the first consulship, and was banished from the land he
loved. Is this, then, the glory of Brutus—this injustice, alike detestable and profitless to the
republic? Was it to this he was driven by “his country’s love, and unextinguished thirst of
praise?”</p>
<p>When Tarquin the tyrant was expelled, L. Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia,
was created consul along with Brutus. How justly the people acted, in looking more to the
character than the name of a citizen! How unjustly Brutus acted, in depriving of honor and
country his colleague in that new office, whom he might have deprived of his name, if it
were so offensive to him! Such were the ills, such the disasters, which fell out when the
government was “ordered with justice and moderation.” Lucretius, too, who succeeded
Brutus, was carried off by disease before the end of that same year. So P. Valerius, who
succeeded Collatinus, and M. Horatius, who filled the vacancy occasioned by the death of
Lucretius, completed that disastrous and funereal year, which had five consuls. Such was
the year in which the Roman republic inaugurated the new honor and office of the consulship.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Of the Disasters Which Vexed the Roman Republic After the Inauguration
of the Consulship, and of the Non-Intervention of the Gods of Rome.</head>
<p>After this, when their fears were gradually diminished,—not because the wars ceased,
but because they were not so furious,—that period in which things were “ordered with
justice and moderation” drew to an end, and there followed that state of matters which
Sallust thus briefly sketches: “Then began the patricians to oppress the people as slaves, to
condemn them to death or scourging, as the kings had done, to drive them from their
holdings, and to tyrannize over those who had no property to lose. The people, overwhelmed
by these oppressive measures, and most of all by usury, and obliged to contribute both
money and personal service to the constant wars, at length took arms and seceded to Mount
Aventine and Mount Sacer, and thus secured for themselves tribunes and protective laws.
But it was only the second Punic war that put an end on both sides to discord and strife.”151
But why should I spend time in writing such things, or make others spend it in reading
them? Let the terse summary of Sallust suffice to intimate the misery of the republic through
all that long period till the second Punic war,—how it was distracted from without by unceasing
wars, and torn with civil broils and dissensions. So that those victories they boast
were not the substantial joys of the happy, but the empty comforts of wretched men, and
seductive incitements to turbulent men to concoct disasters upon disasters. And let not the
good and prudent Romans be angry at our saying this; and indeed we need neither deprecate
nor denounce their anger, for we know they will harbor none. For we speak no more severely
than their own authors, and much less elaborately and strikingly; yet they diligently read
these authors, and compel their children to learn them. But they who are angry, what would
they do to me were I to say what Sallust says? “Frequent mobs, seditions, and at last civil
wars, became common, while a few leading men on whom the masses were dependent, affected
supreme power under the seemly pretence of seeking the good of senate and people;
citizens were judged good or bad without reference to their loyalty to the republic (for all
were equally corrupt); but the wealthy and dangerously powerful were esteemed good citizens,
because they maintained the existing state of things.” Now, if those historians judged that
an honorable freedom of speech required that they should not be silent regarding the
blemishes of their own state, which they have in many places loudly applauded in their ignorance
of that other and true city in which citizenship is an everlasting dignity; what does
it become us to do, whose liberty ought to be so much greater, as our hope in God is better
and more assured, when they impute to our Christ the calamities of this age, in order that
men of the less instructed and weaker sort may be alienated from that city in which alone
eternal and blessed life can be enjoyed? Nor do we utter against their gods anything more
horrible than their own authors do, whom they read and circulate. For, indeed, all that we
<note type="footnote">151 Hist. i.</note>

<pb n="140"/>
have said we have derived from them, and there is much more to say of a worse kind which
we are unable to say.</p>
<p>Where, then, were those gods who are supposed to be justly worshipped for the slender
and delusive prosperity of this world, when the Romans, who were seduced to their service
by lying wiles, were harassed by such calamities? Where were they when Valerius the consul
was killed while defending the Capitol, that had been fired by exiles and slaves? He was
himself better able to defend the temple of Jupiter, than that crowd of divinities with their
most high and mighty king, whose temple he came to the rescue of were able to defend him.
Where were they when the city, worn out with unceasing seditions, was waiting in some
kind of calm for the return of the ambassadors who had been sent to Athens to borrow laws,
and was desolated by dreadful famine and pestilence? Where were they when the people,
again distressed with famine, created for the first time a prefect of the market; and when
Spurius Melius, who, as the famine increased, distributed corn to the famishing masses, was
accused of aspiring to royalty, and at the instance of this same prefect, and on the authority
of the superannuated dictator L. Quintius, was put to death by Quintus Servilius, master of
the horse,—an event which occasioned a serious and dangerous riot? Where were they
when that very severe pestilence visited Rome, on account of which the people, after long
and wearisome and useless supplications of the helpless gods, conceived the idea of celebrating
Lectisternia, which had never been done before; that is to say, they set couches in
honor of the gods, which accounts for the name of this sacred rite, or rather sacrilege?152
Where were they when, during ten successive years of reverses, the Roman army suffered
frequent and great losses among the Veians and would have been destroyed but for the
succor of Furius Camillus, who was afterwards banished by an ungrateful country? Where
were they when the Gauls took, sacked, burned, and desolated Rome? Where were they
when that memorable pestilence wrought such destruction, in which Furius Camillus too
perished, who first defended the ungrateful republic from the Veians, and afterwards saved
it from the Gauls? Nay, during this plague, they introduced a new pestilence of scenic entertainments,
which spread its more fatal contagion, not to the bodies, but the morals of the
Romans? Where were they when another frightful pestilence visited the city—I mean the
poisonings imputed to an incredible number of noble Roman matrons, whose characters
were infected with a disease more fatal than any plague? Or when both consuls at the head
of the army were beset by the Samnites in the Caudine Forks, and forced to strike a shameful
treaty, 600 Roman knights being kept as hostages; while the troops, having laid down their
arms, and being stripped of everything, were made to pass under the yoke with one garment
each? Or when, in the midst of a serious pestilence, lightning struck the Roman camp and
killed many? Or when Rome was driven, by the violence of another intolerable plague, to
<note type="footnote">152 Lectisternia, from lectus, and sterno, I spread.</note>

<pb n="141"/>
send to Epidaurus for Æsculapius as a god of medicine; since the frequent adulteries of
Jupiter in his youth had not perhaps left this king of all who so long reigned in the Capitol,
any leisure for the study of medicine? Or when, at one time, the Lucanians, Brutians,
Samnites, Tuscans, and Senonian Gauls conspired against Rome, and first slew her ambassadors,
then overthrew an army under the prætor, putting to the sword 13,000 men, besides
the commander and seven tribunes? Or when the people, after the serious and long-continued
disturbances at Rome, at last plundered the city and withdrew to Janiculus; a danger so
grave, that Hortensius was created dictator,—an office which they had recourse to only in
extreme emergencies; and he, having brought back the people, died while yet he retained
his office,—an event without precedent in the case of any dictator, and which was a shame
to those gods who had now Æsculapius among them?</p>
<p>At that time, indeed, so many wars were everywhere engaged in, that through scarcity
of soldiers they enrolled for military service the proletarii, who received this name, because,
being too poor to equip for military service, they had leisure to beget offspring.153 Pyrrhus,
king of Greece, and at that time of widespread renown, was invited by the Tarentines to
enlist himself against Rome. It was to him that Apollo, when consulted regarding the issue
of his enterprise, uttered with some pleasantry so ambiguous an oracle, that whichever alternative
happened, the god himself should be counted divine. For he so worded the oracle154
that whether Pyrrhus was conquered by the Romans, or the Romans by Pyrrhus, the
soothsaying god would securely await the issue. And then what frightful massacres of both
armies ensued! Yet Pyrrhus remained conqueror, and would have been able now to proclaim
Apollo a true diviner, as he understood the oracle, had not the Romans been the conquerors
in the next engagement. And while such disastrous wars were being waged, a terrible disease
broke out among the women. For the pregnant women died before delivery. And Æsculapius,
I fancy, excused himself in this matter on the ground that he professed to be archphysician,
not midwife. Cattle, too, similarly perished; so that it was believed that the whole
race of animals was destined to become extinct. Then what shall I say of that memorable
winter in which the weather was so incredibly severe, that in the Forum frightfully deep
snow lay for forty days together, and the Tiber was frozen? Had such things happened in
our time, what accusations we should have heard from our enemies! And that other great
pestilence, which raged so long and carried off so many; what shall I say of it? Spite of all
the drugs of Æsculapius, it only grew worse in its second year, till at last recourse was had
to the Sibylline books,—a kind of oracle which, as Cicero says in his De Divinatione, owes
significance to its interpreters, who make doubtful conjectures as they can or as they wish.
In this instance, the cause of the plague was said to be that so many temples had been used
<note type="footnote">153 Proletarius, from proles, offspring.</note>
<note type="footnote">154 The oracle ran: “Dico te, Pyrrhe, vincere posse Romanos.”</note>

<pb n="142"/>
as private residences. And thus Æsculapius for the present escaped the charge of either ignominious
negligence or want of skill. But why were so many allowed to occupy sacred
tenements without interference, unless because supplication had long been addressed in
vain to such a crowd of gods, and so by degrees the sacred places were deserted of worshippers,
and being thus vacant, could without offence be put at least to some human uses? And
the temples, which were at that time laboriously recognized and restored that the plague
might be stayed, fell afterwards into disuse, and were again devoted to the same human
uses. Had they not thus lapsed into obscurity, it could not have been pointed to as proof of
Varro’s great erudition, that in his work on sacred places he cites so many that were unknown.
Meanwhile, the restoration of the temples procured no cure of the plague, but only
a fine excuse for the gods.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—The Disasters Suffered by the Romans in the Punic Wars, Which Were
Not Mitigated by the Protection of the Gods.</head>
<p>In the Punic wars, again, when victory hung so long in the balance between the two
kingdoms, when two powerful nations were straining every nerve and using all their resources
against one another, how many smaller kingdoms were crushed, how many large and
flourishing cities were demolished, how many states were overwhelmed and ruined, how
many districts and lands far and near were desolated! How often were the victors on either
side vanquished! What multitudes of men, both of those actually in arms and of others,
were destroyed! What huge navies, too, were crippled in engagements, or were sunk by
every kind of marine disaster! Were we to attempt to recount or mention these calamities,
we should become writers of history. At that period Rome was mightily perturbed, and resorted
to vain and ludicrous expedients. On the authority of the Sibylline books, the secular
games were re-appointed, which had been inaugurated a century before, but had faded into
oblivion in happier times. The games consecrated to the infernal gods were also renewed
by the pontiffs; for they, too, had sunk into disuse in the better times. And no wonder; for
when they were renewed, the great abundance of dying men made all hell rejoice at its riches,
and give itself up to sport: for certainly the ferocious wars, and disastrous quarrels, and
bloody victories—now on one side, and now on the other—though most calamitous to men,
afforded great sport and a rich banquet to the devils. But in the first Punic war there was
no more disastrous event than the Roman defeat in which Regulus was taken. We made
mention of him in the two former books as an incontestably great man, who had before
conquered and subdued the Carthaginians, and who would have put an end to the first Punic
war, had not an inordinate appetite for praise and glory prompted him to impose on
the worn-out Carthagians harder conditions than they could bear. If the unlooked-for
captivity and unseemly bondage of this man, his fidelity to his oath, and his surpassingly
cruel death, do not bring a blush to the face of the gods, it is true that they are brazen and
bloodless.</p>
<p>Nor were there wanting at that time very heavy disasters within the city itself. For the
Tiber was extraordinarily flooded, and destroyed almost all the lower parts of the city; some
buildings being carried away by the violence of the torrent, while others were soaked to
rottenness by the water that stood round them even after the flood was gone. This visitation
was followed by a fire which was still more destructive, for it consumed some of the loftier
buildings round the Forum, and spared not even its own proper temple, that of Vesta, in
which virgins chosen for this honor, or rather for this punishment, had been employed in
conferring, as it were, everlasting life on fire, by ceaselessly feeding it with fresh fuel. But
at the time we speak of, the fire in the temple was not content with being kept alive: it raged.
And when the virgins, scared by its vehemence, were unable to save those fatal images which

<pb n="144"/>
had already brought destruction on three cities155 in which they had been received, Metellus
the priest, forgetful of his own safety, rushed in and res cued the sacred things, though he
was half roasted in doing so. For either the fire did not recognize even him, or else the
goddess of fire was there,—a goddess who would not have fled from the fire supposing she
had been there. But here you see how a man could be of greater service to Vesta than she
could be to him. Now if these gods could not avert the fire from themselves, what help
against flames or flood could they bring to the state of which they were the reputed guardians?
Facts have shown that they were useless. These objections of ours would be idle if our
adversaries maintained that their idols are consecrated rather as symbols of things eternal,
than to secure the blessings of time; and that thus, though the symbols, like all material and
visible things, might perish, no damage thereby resulted to the things for the sake of which
they had been consecrated, while, as for the images themselves, they could be renewed again
for the same purposes they had formerly served. But with lamentable blindness, they suppose
that, through the intervention of perishable gods, the earthly well-being and temporal
prosperity of the state can be preserved from perishing. And so, when they are reminded
that even when the gods remained among them this well-being and prosperity were blighted,
they blush to change the opinion they are unable to defend.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Of the Calamity of the Second Punic War, Which Consumed the
Strength of Both Parties.</head>
<p>As to the second Punic war, it were tedious to recount the disasters it brought on both
the nations engaged in so protracted and shifting a war, that (by the acknowledgment even
of those writers who have made it their object not so much to narrate the wars as to eulogize
the dominion of Rome) the people who remained victorious were less like conquerors than
conquered. For, when Hannibal poured out of Spain over the Pyrenees, and overran Gaul,
and burst through the Alps, and during his whole course gathered strength by plundering
and subduing as he went, and inundated Italy like a torrent, how bloody were the wars, and
how continuous the engagements, that were fought! How often were the Romans vanquished!
How many towns went over to the enemy, and how many were taken and subdued!
What fearful battles there were, and how often did the defeat of the Romans shed lustre on
the arms of Hannibal! And what shall I say of the wonderfully crushing defeat at Cannæ,
where even Hannibal, cruel as he was, was yet sated with the blood of his bitterest enemies,
and gave orders that they be spared? From this field of battle he sent to Carthage three
bushels of gold rings, signifying that so much of the rank of Rome had that day fallen, that
it was easier to give an idea of it by measure than by numbers and that the frightful slaughter
of the common rank and file whose bodies lay undistinguished by the ring, and who were
numerous in proportion to their meanness, was rather to be conjectured than accurately
reported. In fact, such was the scarcity of soldiers after this, that the Romans impressed
their criminals on the promise of impunity, and their slaves by the bribe of liberty, and out
of these infamous classes did not so much recruit as create an army. But these slaves, or, to
give them all their titles, these freed-men who were enlisted to do battle for the republic of
Rome, lacked arms. And so they took arms from the temples, as if the Romans were saying
to their gods: Lay down those arms you have held so long in vain, if by chance our slaves
may be able to use to purpose what you, our gods, have been impotent to use. At that time,
too, the public treasury was too low to pay the soldiers, and private resources were used for
public purposes; and so generously did individuals contribute of their property, that, saving
the gold ring and bulla which each wore, the pitiful mark of his rank, no senator, and much
less any of the other orders and tribes, reserved any gold for his own use. But if in our day
they were reduced to this poverty, who would be able to endure their reproaches, barely
endurable as they are now, when more money is spent on actors for the sake of a superfluous
gratification, than was then disbursed to the legions?</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Of the Destruction of the Saguntines, Who Received No Help from
the Roman Gods, Though Perishing on Account of Their Fidelity to Rome.</head>
<p>But among all the disasters of the second Punic war, there occurred none more lamentable,
or calculated to excite deeper complaint, than the fate of the Saguntines. This city of
Spain, eminently friendly to Rome, was destroyed by its fidelity to the Roman people. For
when Hannibal had broken treaty with the Romans, he sought occasion for provoking them
to war, and accordingly made a fierce assault upon Saguntum. When this was reported at
Rome, ambassadors were sent to Hannibal, urging him to raise the siege; and when this remonstrance
was neglected, they proceeded to Carthage, lodged complaint against the
breaking of the treaty, and returned to Rome without accomplishing their object. Meanwhile
the siege went on; and in the eighth or ninth month, this opulent but ill-fated city, dear as
it was to its own state and to Rome, was taken, and subjected to treatment which one cannot
read, much less narrate, without horror. And yet, because it bears directly on the matter in
hand, I will briefly touch upon it. First, then, famine wasted the Saguntines, so that even
human corpses were eaten by some: so at least it is recorded. Subsequently, when thoroughly
worn out, that they might at least escape the ignominy of falling into the hands of Hannibal,
they publicly erected a huge funeral pile, and cast themselves into its flames, while at the
same time they slew their children and themselves with the sword. Could these gods, these
debauchees and gourmands, whose mouths water for fat sacrifices, and whose lips utter lying
divinations,—could they not do anything in a case like this? Could they not interfere for
the preservation of a city closely allied to the Roman people, or prevent it perishing for its
fidelity to that alliance of which they themselves had been the mediators? Saguntum,
faithfully keeping the treaty it had entered into before these gods, and to which it had firmly
bound itself by an oath, was besieged, taken, and destroyed by a perjured person. If afterwards,
when Hannibal was close to the walls of Rome, it was the gods who terrified him
with lightning and tempest, and drove him to a distance, why, I ask, did they not thus interfere
before? For I make bold to say, that this demonstration with the tempest would have been
more honorably made in defence of the allies of Rome—who were in danger on account of
their reluctance to break faith with the Romans, and had no resources of their own—than
in defence of the Romans themselves, who were fighting in their own cause, and had
abundant resources to oppose Hannibal. If, then, they had been the guardians of Roman
prosperity and glory, they would have preserved that glory from the stain of this Saguntine
disaster; and how silly it is to believe that Rome was preserved from destruction at the hands
of Hannibal by the guardian care of those gods who were unable to rescue the city of
Saguntum from perishing through its fidelity to the alliance of Rome. If the population of
Saguntum had been Christian, and had suffered as it did for the Christian faith (though, of
course, Christians would not have used fire and sword against their own persons), they
would have suffered with that hope which springs from faith in Christ—the hope not of a

<pb n="147"/>
brief temporal reward, but of unending and eternal bliss. What, then, will the advocates
and apologists of these gods say in their defence, when charged with the blood of these
Saguntines; for they are professedly worshipped and invoked for this very purpose of securing
prosperity in this fleeting and transitory life? Can anything be said but what was alleged in
the case of Regulus’ death? For though there is a difference between the two cases, the one
being an individual, the other a whole community, yet the cause of destruction was in both
cases the keeping of their plighted troth. For it was this which made Regulus willing to return
to his enemies, and this which made the Saguntines unwilling to revolt to their enemies.
Does, then, the keeping of faith provoke the gods to anger? Or is it possible that not only
individuals, but even entire communities, perish while the gods are propitious to them?
Let our adversaries choose which alternative they will. If, on the one hand, those gods are
enraged at the keeping of faith, let them enlist perjured persons as their worshippers. If, on
the other hand, men and states can suffer great and terrible calamities, and at last perish
while favored by the gods, then does their worship not produce happiness as its fruit. Let
those, therefore, who suppose that they have fallen into distress because their religious
worship has been abolished, lay aside their anger; for it were quite possible that did the gods
not only remain with them, but regard them with favor, they might yet be left to mourn an
unhappy lot, or might, even like Regulus and the Saguntines, be horribly tormented, and at
last perish miserably.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Of the Ingratitude of Rome to Scipio, Its Deliverer, and of Its Manners
During the Period Which Sallust Describes as the Best.</head>
<p>Omitting many things, that I may not exceed the limits of the work I have proposed to
myself, I come to the epoch between the second and last Punic wars, during which, according
to Sallust, the Romans lived with the greatest virtue and concord. Now, in this period of
virtue and harmony, the great Scipio, the liberator of Rome and Italy, who had with surprising
ability brought to a close the second Punic war—that horrible, destructive, dangerous contest—
who had defeated Hannibal and subdued Carthage, and whose whole life is said to
have been dedicated to the gods, and cherished in their temples,—this Scipio, after such a
triumph, was obliged to yield to the accusations of his enemies, and to leave his country,
which his valor had saved and liberated, to spend the remainder of his days in the town of
Liternum, so indifferent to a recall from exile, that he is said to have given orders that not
even his remains should lie in his ungrateful country. It was at that time also that the proconsul
Cn. Manlius, after subduing the Galatians, introduced into Rome the luxury of Asia,
more destructive than all hostile armies. It was then that iron bedsteads and expensive
carpets were first used; then, too, that female singers were admitted at banquets, and other
licentious abominations were introduced. But at present I meant to speak, not of the evils
men voluntarily practise, but of those they suffer in spite of themselves. So that the case of
Scipio, who succumbed to his enemies, and died in exile from the country he had rescued,
was mentioned by me as being pertinent to the present discussion; for this was the reward
he received from those Roman gods whose temples he saved from Hannibal, and who are
worshipped only for the sake of securing temporal happiness. But since Sallust, as we have
seen, declares that the manners of Rome were never better than at that time, I therefore
judged it right to mention the Asiatic luxury then introduced, that it might be seen that
what he says is true, only when that period is compared with the others during which the
morals were certainly worse, and the factions more violent. For at that time—I mean between
the second and third Punic war—that notorious Lex Voconia was passed, which prohibited
a man from making a woman, even an only daughter, his heir; than which law I am at a loss
to conceive what could be more unjust. It is true that in the interval between these two
Punic wars the misery of Rome was somewhat less. Abroad, indeed, their forces were consumed
by wars, yet also consoled by victories; while at home there were not such disturbances
as at other times. But when the last Punic war had terminated in the utter destruction of
Rome’s rival, which quickly succumbed to the other Scipio, who thus earned for himself the
surname of Africanus, then the Roman republic was overwhelmed with such a host of ills,
which sprang from the corrupt manners induced by prosperity and security, that the sudden
overthrow of Carthage is seen to have injured Rome more seriously than her long-continued
hostility. During the whole subsequent period down to the time of Cæsar Augustus, who
seems to have entirely deprived the Romans of liberty,—a liberty, indeed, which in their

<pb n="149"/>
own judgment was no longer glorious, but full of broils and dangers, and which now was
quite enervated and languishing,—and who submitted all things again to the will of a
monarch, and infused as it were a new life into the sickly old age of the republic, and inaugurated
a fresh régime;—during this whole period, I say, many military disasters were sustained
on a variety of occasions, all of which I here pass by. There was specially the treaty of Numantia,
blotted as it was with extreme disgrace; for the sacred chickens, they say, flew out
of the coop, and thus augured disaster to Mancinus the consul; just as if, during all these
years in which that little city of Numantia had withstood the besieging army of Rome, and
had become a terror to the republic, the other generals had all marched against it under
unfavorable auspices.</p>

<p>These things, I say, I pass in silence; but I can by no means be silent regarding the order
given by Mithridates, king of Asia, that on one day all Roman citizens residing anywhere
in Asia (where great numbers of them were following their private business) should be put
to death: and this order was executed. How miserable a spectacle was then presented, when
each man was suddenly and treacherously murdered wherever he happened to be, in the
field or on the road, in the town, in his own home, or in the street, in market or temple, in
bed or at table! Think of the groans of the dying, the tears of the spectators, and even of the
executioners themselves. For how cruel a necessity was it that compelled the hosts of these
victims, not only to see these abominable butcheries in their own houses, but even to perpetrate
them: to change their countenance suddenly from the bland kindliness of friendship,
and in the midst of peace set about the business of war; and, shall I say, give and receive
wounds, the slain being pierced in body, the slayer in spirit! Had all these murdered persons,
then, despised auguries? Had they neither public nor household gods to consult when they
left their homes and set out on that fatal journey? If they had not, our adversaries have no
reason to complain of these Christian times in this particular, since long ago the Romans
despised auguries as idle. If, on the other hand, they did consult omens, let them tell us
what good they got thereby, even when such things were not prohibited, but authorized, by
human, if not by divine law.</p>

<p>But let us now mention, as succinctly as possible, those disasters which were still more
vexing, because nearer home; I mean those discords which are erroneously called civil, since
they destroy civil interests. The seditions had now become urban wars, in which blood was
freely shed, and in which parties raged against one another, not with wrangling and verbal
contention, but with physical force and arms. What a sea of Roman blood was shed, what
desolations and devastations were occasioned in Italy by wars social, wars servile, wars civil!
Before the Latins began the social war against Rome, all the animals used in the service of
man—dogs, horses, asses, oxen, and all the rest that are subject to man—suddenly grew
wild, and forgot their domesticated tameness, forsook their stalls and wandered at large,
and could not be closely approached either by strangers or their own masters without danger.
If this was a portent, how serious a calamity must have been portended by a plague which,
whether portent or no, was in itself a serious calamity! Had it happened in our day, the
heathen would have been more rabid against us than their animals were against them.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Of the Civil Dissension Occasioned by the Sedition of the Gracchi.</head>
<p>The civil wars originated in the seditions which the Gracchi excited regarding the
agrarian laws; for they were minded to divide among the people the lands which were
wrongfully possessed by the nobility. But to reform an abuse of so long standing was an
enterprise full of peril, or rather, as the event proved, of destruction. For what disasters accompanied
the death of the older Gracchus! what slaughter ensued when, shortly after, the
younger brother met the same fate! For noble and ignoble were indiscriminately massacred;
and this not by legal authority and procedure, but by mobs and armed rioters. After the
death of the younger Gracchus, the consul Lucius Opimius, who had given battle to him
within the city, and had defeated and put to the sword both himself and his confederates,
and had massacred many of the citizens, instituted a judicial examination of others, and is
reported to have put to death as many as 3000 men. From this it may be gathered how many
fell in the riotous encounters, when the result even of a judicial investigation was so bloody.
The assassin of Gracchus himself sold his head to the consul for its weight in gold, such
being the previous agreement. In this massacre, too, Marcus Fulvius, a man of consular
rank, with all his children, was put to death.</p>

<pb n="153"/>
<head>Chapter 25.—Of the Temple of Concord, Which Was Erected by a Decree of the
Senate on the Scene of These Seditions and Massacres.</head>
<p>A pretty decree of the senate it was, truly, by which the temple of Concord was built on
the spot where that disastrous rising had taken place, and where so many citizens of every
rank had fallen.156 I suppose it was that the monument of the Gracchi’s punishment might
strike the eye and affect the memory of the pleaders. But what was this but to deride the
gods, by building a temple to that goddess who, had she been in the city, would not have
suffered herself to be torn by such dissensions? Or was it that Concord was chargeable with
that bloodshed because she had deserted the minds of the citizens, and was therefore incarcerated
in that temple? For if they had any regard to consistency, why did they not rather
erect on that site a temple of Discord? Or is there a reason for Concord being a goddess
while Discord is none? Does the distinction of Labeo hold here, who would have made the
one a good, the other an evil deity?—a distinction which seems to have been suggested to
him by the mere fact of his observing at Rome a temple to Fever as well as one to Health.
But, on the same ground, Discord as well as Concord ought to be deified. A hazardous
venture the Romans made in provoking so wicked a goddess, and in forgetting that the destruction
of Troy had been occasioned by her taking offence. For, being indignant that she
was not invited with the other gods [to the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis], she created dissension
among the three goddesses by sending in the golden apple, which occasioned strife
in heaven, victory to Venus, the rape of Helen, and the destruction of Troy. Wherefore, if
she was perhaps offended that the Romans had not thought her worthy of a temple among
the other gods in their city, and therefore disturbed the state with such tumults, to how
much fiercer passion would she be roused when she saw the temple of her adversary erected
on the scene of that massacre, or, in other words, on the scene of her own handiwork! Those
wise and learned men are enraged at our laughing at these follies; and yet, being worshippers
of good and bad divinities alike, they cannot escape this dilemma about Concord and Discord:
either they have neglected the worship of these goddesses, and preferred Fever and
War, to whom there are shrines erected of great antiquity, or they have worshipped them,

<p>But they supposed that, in erecting the temple of Concord within the view of the orators,
as a memorial of the punishment and death of the Gracchi, they were raising an effectual
obstacle to sedition. How much effect it had, is indicated by the still more deplorable wars
that followed. For after this the orators endeavored not to avoid the example of the Gracchi,
but to surpass their projects; as did Lucius Saturninus, a tribune of the people, and Caius
Servilius the prætor, and some time after Marcus Drusus, all of whom stirred seditions
which first of all occasioned bloodshed, and then the social wars by which Italy was grievously
injured, and reduced to a piteously desolate and wasted condition. Then followed the servile
war and the civil wars; and in them what battles were fought, and what blood was shed, so
that almost all the peoples of Italy, which formed the main strength of the Roman empire,
were conquered as if they were barbarians! Then even historians themselves find it difficult
to explain how the servile war was begun by a very few, certainly less than seventy gladiators,
what numbers of fierce and cruel men attached themselves to these, how many of the Roman
generals this band defeated, and how it laid waste many districts and cities. And that was
not the only servile war: the province of Macedonia, and subsequently Sicily and the seacoast,
were also depopulated by bands of slaves. And who can adequately describe either
the horrible atrocities which the pirates first committed, or the wars they afterwards maintained
against Rome?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Of the Civil War Between Marius and Sylla.</head>
<p>But when Marius, stained with the blood of his fellow-citizens, whom the rage of party
had sacrificed, was in his turn vanquished and driven from the city, it had scarcely time to
breathe freely, when, to use the words of Cicero, “Cinna and Marius together returned and
took possession of it. Then, indeed, the foremost men in the state were put to death, its
lights quenched. Sylla afterwards avenged this cruel victory; but we need not say with what
loss of life, and with what ruin to the republic.”157 For of this vengeance, which was more
destructive than if the crimes which it punished had been committed with impunity, Lucan
says: “The cure was excessive, and too closely resembled the disease. The guilty perished,
but when none but the guilty survived: and then private hatred and anger, unbridled by
law, were allowed free indulgence.”158 In that war between Marius and Sylla, besides those
who fell in the field of battle, the city, too, was filled with corpses in its streets, squares,
markets, theatres, and temples; so that it is not easy to reckon whether the victors slew more
before or after victory, that they might be, or because they were, victors. As soon as Marius
triumphed, and returned from exile, besides the butcheries everywhere perpetrated, the
head of the consul Octavius was exposed on the rostrum; Cæsar and Fimbria were assassinated
in their own houses; the two Crassi, father and son, were murdered in one another’s
sight; Bebius and Numitorius were disembowelled by being dragged with hooks; Catulus
escaped the hands of his enemies by drinking poison; Merula, the flamen of Jupiter, cut his
veins and made a libation of his own blood to his god. Moreover, every one whose salutation
Marius did not answer by giving his hand, was at once cut down before his face.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Of the Victory of Sylla, the Avenger of the Cruelties of Marius.</head>
<p>Then followed the victory of Sylla, the so-called avenger of the cruelties of Marius. But
not only was his victory purchased with great bloodshed; but when hostilities were finished,
hostility survived, and the subsequent peace was bloody as the war. To the former and still
recent massacres of the elder Marius, the younger Marius and Carbo, who belonged to the
same party, added greater atrocities. For when Sylla approached, and they despaired not
only of victory, but of life itself, they made a promiscuous massacre of friends and foes.
And, not satisfied with staining every corner of Rome with blood, they besieged the senate,
and led forth the senators to death from the curia as from a prison. Mucius Scævola the
pontiff was slain at the altar of Vesta, which he had clung to because no spot in Rome was
more sacred than her temple; and his blood well-nigh extinguished the fire which was kept
alive by the constant care of the virgins. Then Sylla entered the city victorious, after having
slaughtered in the Villa Publica, not by combat, but by an order, 7000 men who had surrendered,
and were therefore unarmed; so fierce was the rage of peace itself, even after the
rage of war was extinct. Moreover, throughout the whole city every partisan of Sylla slew
whom he pleased, so that the number of deaths went beyond computation, till it was suggested
to Sylla that he should allow some to survive, that the victors might not be destitute of
subjects. Then this furious and promiscuous licence to murder was checked, and much
relief was expressed at the publication of the proscription list, containing though it did the
death-warrant of two thousand men of the highest ranks, the senatorial and equestrian.
The large number was indeed saddening, but it was consolatory that a limit was fixed; nor
was the grief at the numbers slain so great as the joy that the rest were secure. But this very
security, hard-hearted as it was, could not but bemoan the exquisite torture applied to some
of those who had been doomed to die. For one was torn to pieces by the unarmed hands
of the executioners; men treating a living man more savagely than wild beasts are used to
tear an abandoned corpse. Another had his eyes dug out, and his limbs cut away bit by bit,
and was forced to live a long while, or rather to die a long while, in such torture. Some celebrated
cities were put up to auction, like farms; and one was collectively condemned to
slaughter, just as an individual criminal would be condemned to death. These things were
done in peace when the war was over, not that victory might be more speedily obtained,
but that, after being obtained, it might not be thought lightly of. Peace vied with war in
cruelty, and surpassed it: for while war overthrew armed hosts, peace slew the defenceless.
War gave liberty to him who was attacked, to strike if he could; peace granted to the survivors
not life, but an unresisting death.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—A Comparison of the Disasters Which Rome Experienced During the
Gothic and Gallic Invasions, with Those Occasioned by the Authors of the Civil
Wars.</head>
<p>What fury of foreign nations, what barbarian ferocity, can compare with this victory of
citizens over citizens? Which was more disastrous, more hideous, more bitter to Rome:
the recent Gothic and the old Gallic invasion, or the cruelty displayed by Marius and Sylla
and their partisans against men who were members of the same body as themselves? The
Gauls, indeed, massacred all the senators they found in any part of the city except the Capitol,
which alone was defended; but they at least sold life to those who were in the Capitol,
though they might have starved them out if they could not have stormed it. The Goths,
again, spared so many senators, that it is the more surprising that they killed any. But Sylla,
while Marius was still living, established himself as conqueror in the Capitol, which the
Gauls had not violated, and thence issued his death-warrants; and when Marius had escaped
by flight, though destined to return more fierce and bloodthirsty than ever, Sylla issued
from the Capitol even decrees of the senate for the slaughter and confiscation of the property
of many citizens. Then, when Sylla left, what did the Marian faction hold sacred or spare,
when they gave no quarter even to Mucius, a citizen, a senator, a pontiff, and though
clasping in piteous embrace the very altar in which, they say, reside the destinies of Rome?
And that final proscription list of Sylla’s, not to mention countless other massacres, despatched
more senators than the Goths could even plunder.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—Of the Connection of the Wars Which with Great Severity and Frequency
Followed One Another Before the Advent of Christ.</head>
<p>With what effrontery, then, with what assurance, with what impudence, with what folly,
or rather insanity, do they refuse to impute these disasters to their own gods, and impute
the present to our Christ! These bloody civil wars, more distressing, by the avowal of their
own historians, than any foreign wars, and which were pronounced to be not merely
calamitous, but absolutely ruinous to the republic, began long before the coming of Christ,
and gave birth to one another; so that a concatenation of unjustifiable causes led from the
wars of Marius and Sylla to those of Sertorius and Cataline, of whom the one was proscribed,
the other brought up by Sylla; from this to the war of Lepidus and Catulus, of whom the
one wished to rescind, the other to defend the acts of Sylla; from this to the war of Pompey
and Cæsar, of whom Pompey had been a partisan of Sylla, whose power he equalled or even
surpassed, while Cæsar condemned Pompey’s power because it was not his own, and yet
exceeded it when Pompey was defeated and slain. From him the chain of civil wars extended
to the second Cæsar, afterwards called Augustus, and in whose reign Christ was born. For
even Augustus himself waged many civil wars; and in these wars many of the foremost men
perished, among them that skilful manipulator of the republic, Cicero. Caius [Julius] Cæsar,
when he had conquered Pompey, though he used his victory with clemency, and granted
to men of the opposite faction both life and honors, was suspected of aiming at royalty, and
was assassinated in the curia by a party of noble senators, who had conspired to defend the
liberty of the republic. His power was then coveted by Antony, a man of very different
character, polluted and debased by every kind of vice, who was strenuously resisted by
Cicero on the same plea of defending the liberty of the republic. At this juncture that other
Cæsar, the adopted son of Caius, and afterwards, as I said, known by the name of Augustus,
had made his début as a young man of remarkable genius. This youthful Cæsar was favored
by Cicero, in order that his influence might counteract that of Antony; for he hoped that
Cæsar would overthrow and blast the power of Antony, and establish a free state,—so blind
and unaware of the future was he: for that very young man, whose advancement and influence
he was fostering, allowed Cicero to be killed as the seal of an alliance with Antony, and
subjected to his own rule the very liberty of the republic in defence of which he had made
so many orations.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—That It is Effrontery to Impute the Present Troubles to Christ and the
Prohibition of Polytheistic Worship Since Even When the Gods Were Worshipped
Such Calamities Befell the People.</head>
<p>Let those who have no gratitude to Christ for His great benefits, blame their own gods
for these heavy disasters. For certainly when these occurred the altars of the gods were kept
blazing, and there rose the mingled fragrance of “Sabæan incense and fresh garlands;”159
the priests were clothed with honor, the shrines were maintained in splendor; sacrifices,
games, sacred ecstasies, were common in the temples; while the blood of the citizens was
being so freely shed, not only in remote places, but among the very altars of the gods. Cicero
did not choose to seek sanctuary in a temple, because Mucius had sought it there in vain.
But they who most unpardonably calumniate this Christian era, are the very men who either
themselves fled for asylum to the places specially dedicated to Christ, or were led there by
the barbarians that they might be safe. In short, not to recapitulate the many instances I
have cited, and not to add to their number others which it were tedious to enumerate, this
one thing I am persuaded of, and this every impartial judgment will readily acknowledge,
that if the human race had received Christianity before the Punic wars, and if the same
desolating calamities which these wars brought upon Europe and Africa had followed the
introduction of Christianity, there is no one of those who now accuse us who would not
have attributed them to our religion. How intolerable would their accusations have been,
at least so far as the Romans are concerned, if the Christian religion had been received and
diffused prior to the invasion of the Gauls, or to the ruinous floods and fires which desolated
Rome, or to those most calamitous of all events, the civil wars! And those other disasters,
which were of so strange a nature that they were reckoned prodigies, had they happened
since the Christian era, to whom but to the Christians would they have imputed these as
crimes? I do not speak of those things which were rather surprising than hurtful,—oxen
speaking, unborn infants articulating some words in their mothers’ wombs, serpents flying,
hens and women being changed into the other sex; and other similar prodigies which,
whether true or false, are recorded not in their imaginative, but in their historical works,
and which do not injure, but only astonish men. But when it rained earth, when it rained
chalk, when it rained stones—not hailstones, but real stones—this certainly was calculated
to do serious damage. We have read in their books that the fires of Etna, pouring down
from the top of the mountain to the neighboring shore, caused the sea to boil, so that rocks
were burnt up, and the pitch of ships began to run,—a phenomenon incredibly surprising,
but at the same time no less hurtful. By the same violent heat, they relate that on another
occasion Sicily was filled with cinders, so that the houses of the city Catina were destroyed
and buried under them,—a calamity which moved the Romans to pity them, and remit their
<note type="footnote">159 Virgil, Æneid, i. 417.</note>

<pb n="160"/>
tribute for that year. One may also read that Africa, which had by that time become a
province of Rome, was visited by a prodigious multitude of locusts, which, after consuming
the fruit and foliage of the trees, were driven into the sea in one vast and measureless cloud;
so that when they were drowned and cast upon the shore the air was polluted, and so serious
a pestilence produced that in the kingdom of Masinissa alone they say there perished 800,000
persons, besides a much greater number in the neighboring districts. At Utica they assure
us that, of 30,000 soldiers then garrisoning it, there survived only ten. Yet which of these
disasters, suppose they happened now, would not be attributed to the Christian religion by
those who thus thoughtlessly accuse us, and whom we are compelled to answer? And yet
to their own gods they attribute none of these things, though they worship them for the
sake of escaping lesser calamities of the same kind, and do not reflect that they who formerly
worshipped them were not preserved from these serious disasters.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Of the Things Which Have Been Discussed in the First Book.</head>
<p>Having begun to speak of the city of God, I have thought it necessary first of all to reply
to its enemies, who, eagerly pursuing earthly joys and gaping after transitory things, throw
the blame of all the sorrow they suffer in them—rather through the compassion of God in
admonishing than His severity in punishing—on the Christian religion, which is the one
salutary and true religion. And since there is among them also an unlearned rabble, they
are stirred up as by the authority of the learned to hate us more bitterly, thinking in their
inexperience that things which have happened unwontedly in their days were not wont to
happen in other times gone by; and whereas this opinion of theirs is confirmed even by
those who know that it is false, and yet dissemble their knowledge in order that they may
seem to have just cause for murmuring against us, it was necessary, from books in which
their authors recorded and published the history of bygone times that it might be known,
to demonstrate that it is far otherwise than they think; and at the same time to teach that
the false gods, whom they openly worshipped, or still worship in secret, are most unclean
spirits, and most malignant and deceitful demons, even to such a pitch that they take delight
in crimes which, whether real or only fictitious, are yet their own, which it has been their
will to have celebrated in honor of them at their own festivals; so that human infirmity
cannot be called back from the perpetration of damnable deeds, so long as authority is furnished
for imitating them that seems even divine. These things we have proved, not from
our own conjectures, but partly from recent memory, because we ourselves have seen such
things celebrated, and to such deities, partly from the writings of those who have left these
things on record to posterity, not as if in reproach but as in honor of their own gods. Thus
Varro, a most learned man among them, and of the weightiest authority, when he made
separate books concerning things human and things divine, distributing some among the
human, others among the divine, according to the special dignity of each, placed the scenic
plays not at all among things human, but among things divine; though, certainly, if only
there were good and honest men in the state, the scenic plays ought not to be allowed even
among things human. And this he did not on his own authority, but because, being born
and educated at Rome, he found them among the divine things. Now as we briefly stated
in the end of the first book what we intended afterwards to discuss, and as we have disposed
of a part of this in the next two books, we see what our readers will expect us now to take
up.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="163"/>
<head>Chapter 2.—Of Those Things Which are Contained in Books Second and Third.</head>
<p>We had promised, then, that we would say something against those who attribute the
calamities of the Roman republic to our religion, and that we would recount the evils, as
many and great as we could remember or might deem sufficient, which that city, or the
provinces belonging to its empire, had suffered before their sacrifices were prohibited, all
of which would beyond doubt have been attributed to us, if our religion had either already
shone on them, or had thus prohibited their sacrilegious rites. These things we have, as we
think, fully disposed of in the second and third books, treating in the second of evils in
morals, which alone or chiefly are to be accounted evils; and in the third, of those which
only fools dread to undergo—namely, those of the body or of outward things—which for
the most part the good also suffer. But those evils by which they themselves become evil,
they take, I do not say patiently, but with pleasure. And how few evils have I related concerning
that one city and its empire! Not even all down to the time of Cæsar Augustus.
What if I had chosen to recount and enlarge on those evils, not which men have inflicted
on each other; such as the devastations and destructions of war, but which happen in earthly
things, from the elements of the world itself. Of such evils Apuleius speaks briefly in one
passage of that book which he wrote, De Mundo, saying that all earthly things are subject
to change, overthrow, and destruction.161 For, to use his own words, by excessive earthquakes
the ground has burst asunder, and cities with their inhabitants have been clean destroyed:
by sudden rains whole regions have been washed away; those also which formerly had been
continents, have been insulated by strange and new-come waves, and others, by the subsiding
of the sea, have been made passable by the foot of man: by winds and storms cities have
been overthrown; fires have flashed forth from the clouds, by which regions in the East being
burnt up have perished; and on the western coasts the like destructions have been caused
by the bursting forth of waters and floods. So, formerly, from the lofty craters of Etna, rivers
of fire kindled by God have flowed like a torrent down the steeps. If I had wished to collect
from history wherever I could, these and similar instances, where should I have finished
what happened even in those times before the name of Christ had put down those of their
idols, so vain and hurtful to true salvation? I promised that I should also point out which
of their customs, and for what cause, the true God, in whose power all kingdoms are, had
deigned to favor to the enlargement of their empire; and how those whom they think gods
can have profited them nothing, but much rather hurt them by deceiving and beguiling
them; so that it seems to me I must now speak of these things, and chiefly of the increase of
the Roman empire. For I have already said not a little, especially in the second book, about
the many evils introduced into their manners by the hurtful deceits of the demons whom
they worshipped as gods. But throughout all the three books already completed, where it
<note type="footnote">161 Comp. Bacon’s Essay on the Vicissitudes of Things.</note>

<pb n="164"/>
appeared suitable, we have set forth how much succor God, through the name of Christ, to
whom the barbarians beyond the custom of war paid so much honor, has bestowed on the
good and bad, according as it is written, “Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and the
evil, and giveth rain to the just and the unjust.”162</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Whether the Great Extent of the Empire, Which Has Been Acquired
Only by Wars, is to Be Reckoned Among the Good Things Either of the Wise
or the Happy.</head>
<p>Now, therefore, let us see how it is that they dare to ascribe the very great extent and
duration of the Roman empire to those gods whom they contend that they worship honorably,
even by the obsequies of vile games and the ministry of vile men: although I should
like first to inquire for a little what reason, what prudence, there is in wishing to glory in
the greatness and extent of the empire, when you cannot point out the happiness of men
who are always rolling, with dark fear and cruel lust, in warlike slaughters and in blood,
which, whether shed in civil or foreign war, is still human blood; so that their joy may be
compared to glass in its fragile splendor, of which one is horribly afraid lest it should be
suddenly broken in pieces. That this may be more easily discerned, let us not come to nought
by being carried away with empty boasting, or blunt the edge of our attention by loudsounding
names of things, when we hear of peoples, kingdoms, provinces. But let us suppose
a case of two men; for each individual man, like one letter in a language, is as it were the
element of a city or kingdom, however far-spreading in its occupation of the earth. Of these
two men let us suppose that one is poor, or rather of middling circumstances; the other very
rich. But the rich man is anxious with fears, pining with discontent, burning with covetous-
ness, never se cure, always uneasy, panting from the perpetual strife of his enemies, adding
to his patrimony indeed by these miseries to an immense degree, and by these additions
also heaping up most bitter cares. But that other man of moderate wealth is contented with
a small and compact estate, most dear to his own family, enjoying the sweetest peace with
his kindred neighbors and friends, in piety religious, benignant in mind, healthy in body,
in life frugal, in manners chaste, in conscience secure. I know not whether any one can be
such a fool, that he dare hesitate which to prefer. As, therefore, in the case of these two men,
so in two families, in two nations, in two kingdoms, this test of tranquility holds good; and
if we apply it vigilantly and without prejudice, we shall quite easily see where the mere show
of happiness dwells, and where real felicity. Wherefore if the true God is worshipped, and
if He is served with genuine rites and true virtue, it is advantageous that good men should
long reign both far and wide. Nor is this advantageous so much to themselves, as to those
over whom they reign. For, so far as concerns themselves, their piety and probity, which
are great gifts of God, suffice to give them true felicity, enabling them to live well the life
that now is, and afterwards to receive that which is eternal. In this world, therefore, the
dominion of good men is profitable, not so much for themselves as for human affairs. But
the dominion of bad men is hurtful chiefly to themselves who rule, for they destroy their
own souls by greater license in wickedness; while those who are put under them in service
are not hurt except by their own iniquity. For to the just all the evils imposed on them by

<pb n="166"/>
unjust rulers are not the punishment of crime, but the test of virtue. Therefore the good
man, although he is a slave, is free; but the bad man, even if he reigns, is a slave, and that
not of one man, but, what is far more grievous, of as many masters as he has vices; of which
vices when the divine Scripture treats, it says, “For of whom any man is overcome, to the
same he is also the bond-slave.”163</p>

<p>Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but great robberies? For what are
robberies themselves, but little kingdoms? The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled by
the authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact of the confederacy; the booty is divided
by the law agreed on. If, by the admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases to such a
degree that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities, and subdues peoples, it
assumes the more plainly the name of a kingdom, because the reality is now manifestly
conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness, but by the addition of impunity. Indeed,
that was an apt and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had
been seized. For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession
of the sea, he answered with bold pride, “What thou meanest by seizing the whole
earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with
a great fleet art styled emperor.”164</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of the Runaway Gladiators Whose Power Became Like that of Royal
Dignity.</head>
<p>I shall not therefore stay to inquire what sort of men Romulus gathered together, seeing
he deliberated much about them,—how, being assumed out of that life they led into the
fellowship of his city, they might cease to think of the punishment they deserved, the fear
of which had driven them to greater villainies; so that henceforth they might be made more
peaceable members of society. But this I say, that the Roman empire, which by subduing
many nations had already grown great and an object of universal dread, was itself greatly
alarmed, and only with much difficulty avoided a disastrous overthrow, because a mere
handful of gladiators in Campania, escaping from the games, had recruited a great army,
appointed three generals, and most widely and cruelly devastated Italy. Let them say what
god aided these men, so that from a small and contemptible band of robbers they attained
to a kingdom, feared even by the Romans, who had such great forces and fortresses. Or will
they deny that they were divinely aided because they did not last long?165 As if, indeed, the
life of any man whatever lasted long. In that case, too, the gods aid no one to reign, since
all individuals quickly die; nor is sovereign power to be reckoned a benefit, because in a
little time in every man, and thus in all of them one by one, it vanishes like a vapor. For
what does it matter to those who worshipped the gods under Romulus, and are long since
dead, that after their death the Roman empire has grown so great, while they plead their
causes before the powers beneath? Whether those causes are good or bad, it matters not
to the question before us. And this is to be understood of all those who carry with them the
heavy burden of their actions, having in the few days of their life swiftly and hurriedly passed
over the stage of the imperial office, although the office itself has lasted through long spaces
of time, being filled by a constant succession of dying men. If, however, even those benefits
which last only for the shortest time are to be ascribed to the aid of the gods, these gladiators
were not a little aided, who broke the bonds of their servile condition, fled, escaped, raised
a great and most powerful army, obedient to the will and orders of their chiefs and much
feared by the Roman majesty, and remaining unsubdued by several Roman generals, seized
many places, and, having won very many victories, enjoyed whatever pleasures they wished,
and did what their lust suggested, and, until at last they were conquered, which was done
with the utmost difficulty, lived sublime and dominant. But let us come to greater matters.</p>

of this majesty not by courting the people, but by the knowledge good men had of their
moderation. The people were held bound by no laws; the decisions of the princes were instead
of laws. It was the custom to guard rather than to extend the boundaries of the empire;
and kingdoms were kept within the bounds of each ruler’s native land. Ninus king of the
Assyrians first of all, through new lust of empire, changed the old and, as it were, ancestral
custom of nations. He first made war on his neighbors, and wholly subdued as far as to the
frontiers of Libya the nations as yet untrained to resist.” And a little after he says: “Ninus
established by constant possession the greatness of the authority he had gained. Having
mastered his nearest neighbors, he went on to others, strengthened by the accession of
forces, and by making each fresh victory the instrument of that which followed, subdued
the nations of the whole East.” Now, with whatever fidelity to fact either he or Trogus may
in general have written—for that they sometimes told lies is shown by other more trustworthy
writers—yet it is agreed among other authors, that the kingdom of the Assyrians was extended
far and wide by King Ninus. And it lasted so long, that the Roman empire has not yet attained
the same age; for, as those write who have treated of chronological history, this kingdom
endured for twelve hundred and forty years from the first year in which Ninus began to
reign, until it was transferred to the Medes. But to make war on your neighbors, and thence
to proceed to others, and through mere lust of dominion to crush and subdue people who
do you no harm, what else is this to be called than great robbery?</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Whether Earthly Kingdoms in Their Rise and Fall Have Been Either
Aided or Deserted by the Help of the Gods.</head>
<p>If this kingdom was so great and lasting without the aid of the gods, why is the ample
territory and long duration of the Roman empire to be ascribed to the Roman gods? For
whatever is the cause in it, the same is in the other also. But if they contend that the
prosperity of the other also is to be attributed to the aid of the gods, I ask of which? For the
other nations whom Ninus overcame, did not then worship other gods. Or if the Assyrians
had gods of their own, who, so to speak, were more skillful workmen in the construction
and preservation of the empire, whether are they dead, since they themselves have also lost
the empire; or, having been defrauded of their pay, or promised a greater, have they chosen
rather to go over to the Medes, and from them again to the Persians, because Cyrus invited
them, and promised them something still more advantageous? This nation, indeed, since
the time of the kingdom of Alexander the Macedonian, which was as brief in duration as it
was great in extent, has preserved its own empire, and at this day occupies no small territories
in the East. If this is so, then either the gods are unfaithful, who desert their own and go
over to their enemies, which Camillus, who was but a man, did not do, when, being victor
and subduer of a most hostile state, although he had felt that Rome, for whom he had done
so much, was ungrateful, yet afterwards, forgetting the injury and remembering his native
land, he freed her again from the Gauls; or they are not so strong as gods ought to be, since
they can be overcome by human skill or strength. Or if, when they carry on war among
themselves, the gods are not overcome by men, but some gods who are peculiar to certain
cities are perchance overcome by other gods, it follows that they have quarrels among
themselves which they uphold, each for his own part. Therefore a city ought not to worship
its own gods, but rather others who aid their own worshippers. Finally, whatever may have
been the case as to this change of sides, or flight, or migration, or failure in battle on the
part of the gods, the name of Christ had not yet been proclaimed in those parts of the earth
when these kingdoms were lost and transferred through great destructions in war. For if,
after more than twelve hundred years, when the kingdom was taken away from the Assyrians,
the Christian religion had there already preached another eternal kingdom, and put a stop
to the sacrilegious worship of false gods, what else would the foolish men of that nation
have said, but that the kingdom which had been so long preserved, could be lost for no
other cause than the desertion of their own religions and the reception of Christianity? In
which foolish speech that might have been uttered, let those we speak of observe their own
likeness, and blush, if there is any sense of shame in them, because they have uttered similar
complaints; although the Roman empire is afflicted rather than changed,—a thing which
has befallen it in other times also, before the name of Christ was heard, and it has been restored
after such affliction,—a thing which even in these times is not to be despaired of.
For who knows the will of God concerning this matter?</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Which of the Gods Can the Romans Suppose Presided Over the Increase
and Preservation of Their Empire, When They Have Believed that Even the Care
of Single Things Could Scarcely Be Committed to Single Gods.</head>
<p>Next let us ask, if they please, out of so great a crowd of gods which the Romans worship,
whom in especial, or what gods they believe to have extended and preserved that empire.
Now, surely of this work, which is so excellent and so very full of the highest dignity, they
dare not ascribe any part to the goddess Cloacina;166 or to Volupia, who has her appellation
from voluptuousness; or to Libentina, who has her name from lust; or to Vaticanus, who
presides over the screaming of infants; or to Cunina, who rules over their cradles. But how
is it possible to recount in one part of this book all the names of gods or goddesses, which
they could scarcely comprise in great volumes, distributing among these divinities their
peculiar offices about single things? They have not even thought that the charge of their
lands should be committed to any one god: but they have entrusted their farms to Rusina;
the ridges of the mountains to Jugatinus; over the downs they have set the goddess Collatina;
over the valleys, Vallonia. Nor could they even find one Segetia so competent, that they
could commend to her care all their corn crops at once; but so long as their seed-corn was
still under the ground, they would have the goddess Seia set over it; then, whenever it was
above ground and formed straw, they set over it the goddess Segetia; and when the grain
was collected and stored, they set over it the goddess Tutilina, that it might be kept safe.
Who would not have thought that goddess Segetia sufficient to take care of the standing
corn until it had passed from the first green blades to the dry ears? Yet she was not enough
for men, who loved a multitude of gods, that the miserable soul, despising the chaste embrace
of the one true God, should be prostituted to a crowd of demons. Therefore they set
Proserpina over the germinating seeds; over the joints and knots of the stems, the god
Nodotus; over the sheaths enfolding the ears, the goddess Voluntina; when the sheaths
opened that the spike might shoot forth, it was ascribed to the goddess Patelana; when the
stems stood all equal with new ears, because the ancients described this equalizing by the
term hostire, it was ascribed to the goddess Hostilina; when the grain was in flower, it was
dedicated to the goddess Flora; when full of milk, to the god Lacturnus; when maturing, to
the goddess Matuta; when the crop was runcated,—that is, removed from the soil,—to the
goddess Runcina. Nor do I yet recount them all, for I am sick of all this, though it gives
them no shame. Only, I have said these very few things, in order that it may be understood
they dare by no means say that the Roman empire has been established, increased, and
<note type="footnote">166 Cloacina, supposed by Lactantius (De falsa relig. i. 20), Cyprian (De Idol. vanit.), and Augustin (infra, c.
23) to be the goddess of the cloaca, or sewage of Rome. Others, however, suppose it to be equivalent to Cluacina,
a title given to Venus, because the Romans after the end of the Sabine war purified themselves (cluere) in the
vicinity of her statue.</note>

<pb n="172"/>
preserved by their deities, who had all their own functions assigned to them in such a way,
that no general oversight was entrusted to any one of them. When, therefore, could Segetia
take care of the empire, who was not allowed to take care of the corn and the trees? When
could Cunina take thought about war, whose oversight was not allowed to go beyond the
cradles of the babies? When could Nodotus give help in battle, who had nothing to do even
with the sheath of the ear, but only with the knots of the joints? Every one sets a porter at
the door of his house, and because he is a man, he is quite sufficient; but these people have
set three gods, Forculus to the doors, Cardea to the hinge, Limentinus to the threshold.167
Thus Forculus could not at the same time take care also of the hinge and the threshold.</p>

<p>Therefore omitting, or passing by for a little, that crowd of petty gods, we ought to inquire
into the part performed by the great gods, whereby Rome has been made so great as to reign
so long over so many nations. Doubtless, therefore, this is the work of Jove. For they will
have it that he is the king of all the gods and goddesses, as is shown by his sceptre and by
the Capitol on the lofty hill. Concerning that god they publish a saying which, although
that of a poet, is most apt, “All things are full of Jove.”168 Varro believes that this god is
worshipped, although called by another name, even by those who worship one God alone
without any image. But if this is so, why has he been so badly used at Rome (and indeed by
other nations too), that an image of him should be made?—a thing which was so displeasing
to Varro himself, that although he was overborne by the perverse custom of so great a city,
he had not the least hesitation in both saying and writing, that those who have appointed
images for the people have both taken away fear and added error.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—What Opinions Those Have Followed Who Have Set Divers Gods
Over Divers Parts of the World.</head>
<p>Why, also, is Juno united to him as his wife, who is called at once “sister and yoke-fellow?”
169 Because, say they, we have Jove in the ether, Juno in the air; and these two elements
are united, the one being superior, the other inferior. It is not he, then, of whom it is said,
“All things are full of Jove,” if Juno also fills some part. Does each fill either, and are both
of this couple in both of these elements, and in each of them at the same time? Why, then,
is the ether given to Jove, the air to Juno? Besides, these two should have been enough.
Why is it that the sea is assigned to Neptune, the earth to Pluto? And that these also might
not be left without mates, Salacia is joined to Neptune, Proserpine to Pluto. For they say
that, as Juno possesses the lower part of the heavens,—that is, the air,—so Salacia possesses
the lower part of the sea, and Proserpine the lower part of the earth. They seek how they
may patch up these fables, but they find no way. For if these things were so, their ancient
sages would have maintained that there are three chief elements of the world, not four, in
order that each of the elements might have a pair of gods. Now, they have positively affirmed
that the ether is one thing, the air another. But water, whether higher or lower, is surely
water. Suppose it ever so unlike, can it ever be so much so as no longer to be water? And
the lower earth, by whatever divinity it may be distinguished, what else can it be than earth?
Lo, then, since the whole physical world is complete in these four or three elements, where
shall Minerva be? What should she possess, what should she fill? For she is placed in the
Capitol along with these two, although she is not the offspring of their marriage. Or if they
say that she possesses the higher part of the ether,—and on that account the poets have
feigned that she sprang from the head of Jove,—why then is she not rather reckoned queen
of the gods, because she is superior to Jove? Is it because it would be improper to set the
daughter before the father? Why, then, is not that rule of justice observed concerning Jove
himself toward Saturn? Is it because he was conquered? Have they fought then? By no
means, say they; that is an old wife’s fable. Lo, we are not to believe fables, and must hold
more worthy opinions concerning the gods! Why, then, do they not assign to the father of
Jove a seat, if not of higher, at least of equal honor? Because Saturn, say they, is length of
time.170 Therefore they who worship Saturn worship Time; and it is insinuated that Jupiter,
the king of the gods, was born of Time. For is anything unworthy said when Jupiter and
Juno are said to have been sprung from Time, if he is the heaven and she is the earth, since
both heaven and earth have been made, and are therefore not eternal? For their learned
and wise men have this also in their books. Nor is that saying taken by Virgil out of poetic
figments, but out of the books of philosophers,</p>

<p>“Then Ether, the Father Almighty, in copious showers descended
Into his spouse’s glad bosom, making it fertile,”171</p>
<p>that is, into the bosom of Tellus, or the earth. Although here, also, they will have it
that there are some differences, and think that in the earth herself Terra is one thing, Tellus
another, and Tellumo another. And they have all these as gods, called by their own names
distinguished by their own offices, and venerated with their own altars and rites. This same
earth also they call the mother of the gods, so that even the fictions of the poets are more
tolerable, if, according, not to their poetical but sacred books, Juno is not only the sister and
wife, but also the mother of Jove. The same earth they worship as Ceres, and also as Vesta;
while yet they more frequently affirm that Vesta is nothing else than fire, pertaining to the
hearths, without which the city cannot exist; and therefore virgins are wont to serve her,
because as nothing is born of a virgin, so nothing is born of fire;—but all this nonsense
ought to be completely abolished and extinguished by Him who is born of a virgin. For
who can bear that, while they ascribe to the fire so much honor, and, as it were, chastity,
they do not blush sometimes even to call Vesta Venus, so that honored virginity may vanish
in her hand-maidens? For if Vesta is Venus, how can virgins rightly serve her by abstaining
from venery? Are there two Venuses, the one a virgin, the other not a maid? Or rather, are
there three, one the goddess of virgins, who is also called Vesta, another the goddess of
wives, and another of harlots? To her also the Phenicians offered a gift by prostituting their
daughters before they united them to husbands.172 Which of these is the wife of Vulcan?
Certainly not the virgin, since she has a husband. Far be it from us to say it is the harlot,
lest we should seem to wrong the son of Juno and fellow-worker of Minerva. Therefore it
is to be understood that she belongs to the married people; but we would not wish them to
imitate her in what she did with Mars. “Again,” say they, “you return to fables.” What sort
of justice is that, to be angry with us because we say such things of their gods, and not to be
angry with themselves, who in their theatres most willingly behold the crimes of their gods?
And,—a thing incredible, if it were not thoroughly well proved,—these very theatric representations
of the crimes of their gods have been instituted in honor of these same gods.</p>

earth, as his wife, and, at the same time, his mother (for this is not vile in divine beings);

who brings forth the birth to the light of day: let him be the goddess Mena, whom they set
over the menstruation of women: let him be Lucina, who is invoked by women in childbirth:
let him bring help to those who are being born, by taking them up from the bosom of the

him be both the god Consus for granting counsel, and the goddess Sentia for inspiring

takes charge of the beginning of the youthful age: let him be Fortuna Barbata, who endues
adults with a beard, whom they have not chosen to honor; so that this divinity, whatever it
may be, should at least be a male god, named either Barbatus, from barba, like Nodotus,
from nodus; or, certainly, not Fortuna, but because he has beards, Fortunius: let him, in the
god Jugatinus, yoke couples in marriage; and when the girdle of the virgin wife is loosed,
let him be invoked as the goddess Virginiensis: let him be Mutunus or Tuternus, who,
among the Greeks, is called Priapus. If they are not ashamed of it, let all these which I have
named, and whatever others I have not named (for I have not thought fit to name all), let
all these gods and goddesses be that one Jupiter, whether, as some will have it, all these are
parts of him, or are his powers, as those think who are pleased to consider him the soul of
the world, which is the opinion of most of their doctors, and these the greatest. If these
things are so (how evil they may be I do not yet meanwhile inquire), what would they lose,
if they, by a more prudent abridgment, should worship one god? For what part of him could
be contemned if he himself should be worshipped? But if they are afraid lest parts of him
should be angry at being passed by or neglected, then it is not the case, as they will have it,
that this whole is as the life of one living being, which contains all the gods together, as if
they were its virtues, or members, or parts; but each part has its own life separate from the
rest, if it is so that one can be angered, appeased, or stirred up more than another. But if it
is said that all together,—that is, the whole Jove himself,—would be offended if his parts
were not also worshipped singly and minutely, it is foolishly spoken. Surely none of them
could be passed by if he who singly possesses them all should be worshipped. For, to omit
other things which are innumerable, when they say that all the stars are parts of Jove, and
are all alive, and have rational souls, and therefore without controversy are gods, can they
not see how many they do not worship, to how many they do not build temples or set up
altars, and to how very few, in fact, of the stars they have thought of setting them up and
offering sacrifice? If, therefore, those are displeased who are not severally worshipped, do
they not fear to live with only a few appeased, while all heaven is displeased? But if they
worship all the stars because they are part of Jove whom they worship, by the same compendious
method they could supplicate them all in him alone. For in this way no one would
be displeased, since in him alone all would be supplicated. No one would be contemned,
instead of there being just cause of displeasure given to the much greater number who are
passed by in the worship offered to some; especially when Priapus, stretched out in vile nakedness,
is preferred to those who shine from their supernal abode.</p>

But what need is there of striving about that? Concerning the rational animal himself,—that
is, man,—what more unhappy belief can be entertained than that a part of God is whipped
when a boy is whipped? And who, unless he is quite mad, could bear the thought that parts
of God can become lascivi ous, iniquitous, impious, and altogether damnable? In brief,
why is God angry at those who do not worship Him, since these offenders are parts of
Himself? It remains, therefore, that they must say that all the gods have their own lives; that
each one lives for himself, and none of them is a part of any one; but that all are to be worshipped,—
at least as many as can be known and worshipped; for they are so many it is impossible
that all can be so. And of all these, I believe that Jupiter, because he presides as
king, is thought by them to have both established and extended the Roman empire. For if
he has not done it, what other god do they believe could have attempted so great a work,
when they must all be occupied with their own offices and works, nor can one intrude on

not it also be so, if Victory is a goddess? Or what need is there of Jove himself in this affair,

With this goddess favorable and propitious, even if Jove was idle and did nothing,
what nations could remain unsubdued, what kingdom would not yield? But perhaps it is

<head>Chapter 15.—Whether It is Suitable for Good Men to Wish to Rule More Widely.</head>
<p>Let them ask, then, whether it is quite fitting for good men to rejoice in extended empire.
For the iniquity of those with whom just wars are carried on favors the growth of a kingdom,
which would certainly have been small if the peace and justice of neighbors had not by any
wrong provoked the carrying on of war against them; and human affairs being thus more
happy, all kingdoms would have been small, rejoicing in neighborly concord; and thus there
would have been very many kingdoms of nations in the world, as there are very many houses
of citizens in a city. Therefore, to carry on war and extend a kingdom over wholly subdued
nations seems to bad men to be felicity, to good men necessity. But because it would be
worse that the injurious should rule over those who are more righteous, therefore even that
is not unsuitably called felicity. But beyond doubt it is greater felicity to have a good
neighbor at peace, than to conquer a bad one by making war. Your wishes are bad, when
you desire that one whom you hate or fear should be in such a condition that you can conquer
him. If, therefore, by carrying on wars that were just, not impious or unrighteous, the Romans
could have acquired so great an empire, ought they not to worship as a goddess even
the injustice of foreigners? For we see that this has cooperated much in extending the empire,
by making foreigners so unjust that they became people with whom just wars might be
carried on, and the empire increased. And why may not injustice, at least that of foreign
nations, also be a goddess, if Fear and Dread and Ague have deserved to be Roman gods?
By these two, therefore,—that is, by foreign injustice, and the goddess Victoria, for injustice
stirs up causes of wars, and Victoria brings these same wars to a happy termination,—the
empire has increased, even although Jove has been idle. For what part could Jove have here,
when those things which might be thought to be his benefits are held to be gods, called gods,
worshipped as gods, and are themselves invoked for their own parts? He also might have
some part here, if he himself might be called Empire, just as she is called Victory. Or if
empire is the gift of Jove, why may not victory also be held to be his gift? And it certainly
would have been held to be so, had he been recognized and worshipped, not as a stone in
the Capitol, but as the true King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—What Was the Reason Why the Romans, in Detailing Separate Gods
for All Things and All Movements of the Mind, Chose to Have the Temple of
Quiet Outside the Gates.</head>
<p>But I wonder very much, that while they assigned to separate gods single things, and
(well nigh) all movements of the mind; that while they invoked the goddess Agenoria, who
should excite to action; the goddess Stimula, who should stimulate to unusual action; the
goddess Murcia, who should not move men beyond measure, but make them, as Pomponius
says, murcid—that is, too slothful and inactive; the goddess Strenua, who should make them
strenuous; and that while they offered to all these gods and goddesses solemn and public
73
worship, they should yet have been unwilling to give public acknowledgment to her whom
they name Quies because she makes men quiet, but built her temple outside the Colline
gate. Whether was this a symptom of an unquiet mind, or rather was it thus intimated that
he who should persevere in worshipping that crowd, not, to be sure, of gods, but of demons,
could not dwell with quiet; to which the true Physician calls, saying, “Learn of me, for I am
meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls?”</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Whether, If the Highest Power Belongs to Jove, Victoria Also Ought
to Be Worshipped.</head>
<p>Or do they say, perhaps, that Jupiter sends the goddess Victoria, and that she, as it were
acting in obedience to the king of the gods, comes to those to whom he may have despatched
her, and takes up her quarters on their side? This is truly said, not of Jove, whom they, according
to their own imagination, feign to be king of the gods, but of Him who is the true
eternal King, because he sends, not Victory, who is no person, but His angel, and causes
whom He pleases to conquer; whose counsel may be hidden, but cannot be unjust. For if
Victory is a goddess, why is not Triumph also a god, and joined to Victory either as husband,
or brother, or son? Indeed, they have imagined such things concerning the gods, that if the
poets had feigned the like, and they should have been discussed by us, they would have
replied that they were laughable figments of the poets not to be attributed to true deities.
And yet they themselves did not laugh when they were, not reading in the poets, but worshipping
in the temples such doating follies. Therefore they should entreat Jove alone for
all things, and supplicate him only. For if Victory is a goddess, and is under him as her king,
wherever he might have sent her, she could not dare to resist and do her own will rather
than his.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—With What Reason They Who Think Felicity and Fortune Goddesses
Have Distinguished Them.</head>
<p>What shall we say, besides, of the idea that Felicity also is a goddess? She has received
a temple; she has merited an altar; suitable rites of worship are paid to her. She alone, then,
should be worshipped. For where she is present, what good thing can be absent? But what
does a man wish, that he thinks Fortune also a goddess and worships her? Is felicity one
thing, fortune another? Fortune, indeed, may be bad as well as good; but felicity, if it could
be bad, would not be felicity. Certainly we ought to think all the gods of either sex (if they
also have sex) are only good. This says Plato; this say other philosophers; this say all estimable
rulers of the republic and the nations. How is it, then, that the goddess Fortune is sometimes
good, sometimes bad? Is it perhaps the case that when she is bad she is not a goddess, but
is suddenly changed into a malignant demon? How many Fortunes are there then? Just as
many as there are men who are fortunate, that is, of good fortune. But since there must also
be very many others who at the very same time are men of bad fortune, could she, being
one and the same Fortune, be at the same time both bad and good—the one to these, the
other to those? She who is the goddess, is she always good? Then she herself is felicity.
Why, then, are two names given her? Yet this is tolerable; for it is customary that one thing
should be called by two names. But why different temples, different altars, different rituals?
There is a reason, say they, because Felicity is she whom the good have by previous merit;
but fortune, which is termed good without any trial of merit, befalls both good and bad men
fortuitously, whence also she is named Fortune. How, therefore, is she good, who without
any discernment comes—both to the good and to the bad? Why is she worshipped, who is
thus blind, running at random on any one whatever, so that for the most part she passes by
her worshippers, and cleaves to those who despise her? Or if her worshippers profit somewhat,
so that they are seen by her and loved, then she follows merit, and does not come
fortuitously. What, then, becomes of that definition of fortune? What becomes of the
opinion that she has received her very name from fortuitous events? For it profits one
nothing to worship her if she is truly fortune. But if she distinguishes her worshippers, so
that she may benefit them, she is not fortune. Or does, Jupiter send her too, whither he
pleases? Then let him alone be worshipped; because Fortune is not able to resist him when
he commands her, and sends her where he pleases. Or, at least, let the bad worship her,
who do not choose to have merit by which the goddess Felicity might be invited.</p>

<p>To this supposed deity, whom they call Fortuna, they ascribe so much, indeed, that they
have a tradition that the image of her, which was dedicated by the Roman matrons, and
called Fortuna Muliebris, has spoken, and has said, once and again, that the matrons pleased
her by their homage; which, indeed, if it is true, ought not to excite our wonder. For it is
not so difficult for malignant demons to deceive, and they ought the rather to advert to their
wits and wiles, because it is that goddess who comes by haphazard who has spoken, and not
she who comes to reward merit. For Fortuna was loquacious, and Felicitas mute; and for
what other reason but that men might not care to live rightly, having made Fortuna their
friend, who could make them fortunate without any good desert? And truly, if Fortuna
speaks, she should at least speak, not with a womanly, but with a manly voice; lest they
themselves who have dedicated the image should think so great a miracle has been wrought
by feminine loquacity.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Concerning Virtue and Faith, Which the Pagans Have Honored with
Temples and Sacred Rites, Passing by Other Good Qualities, Which Ought
Likewise to Have Been Worshipped, If Deity Was Rightly Attributed to These.</head>
<p>They have made Virtue also a goddess, which, indeed, if it could be a goddess, had been
preferable to many. And now, because it is not a goddess, but a gift of God, let it be obtained
by prayer from Him, by whom alone it can be given, and the whole crowd of false gods
vanishes. But why is Faith believed to be a goddess, and why does she herself receive temple
and altar? For whoever prudently acknowledges her makes his own self an abode for her.
But how do they know what faith is, of which it is the prime and greatest function that the
true God may be believed in? But why had not virtue sufficed? Does it not include faith
also? Forasmuch as they have thought proper to distribute virtue into four divisions—
prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance—and as each of these divisions has its
own virtues, faith is among the parts of justice, and has the chief place with as many of us
as know what that saying means, “The just shall live by faith.”175 But if Faith is a goddess,
I wonder why these keen lovers of a multitude of gods have wronged so many other goddesses,
by passing them by, when they could have dedicated temples and altars to them
likewise. Why has temperance not deserved to be a goddess, when some Roman princes
have obtained no small glory on account of her? Why, in fine, is fortitude not a goddess,
who aided Mucius when he thrust his right hand into the flames; who aided Curtius, when
for the sake of his country he threw himself headlong into the yawning earth; who aided
Decius the sire, and Decius the son, when they devoted themselves for the army?—though
we might question whether these men had true fortitude, if this concerned our present discussion.
Why have prudence and wisdom merited no place among the gods? Is it because
they are all worshipped under the general name of Virtue itself? Then they could thus
worship the true God also, of whom all the other gods are thought to be parts. But in that
one name of virtue is comprehended both faith and chastity, which yet have obtained separate
altars in temples of their own.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—That Although Not Understanding Them to Be the Gifts of God, They
Ought at Least to Have Been Content with Virtue and Felicity.</head>
<p>These, not verity but vanity has made goddesses. For these are gifts of the true God,
not themselves goddesses. However, where virtue and felicity are, what else is sought for?
What can suffice the man whom virtue and felicity do not suffice? For surely virtue comprehends
all things we need do, felicity all things we need wish for. If Jupiter, then, was
worshipped in order that he might give these two things,—because, if extent and duration
of empire is something good, it pertains to this same felicity,—why is it not understood that
they are not goddesses, but the gifts of God? But if they are judged to be goddesses, then at
least that other great crowd of gods should not be sought after. For, having considered all
the offices which their fancy has distributed among the various gods and goddesses, let them
find out, if they can, anything which could be bestowed by any god whatever on a man
possessing virtue, possessing felicity. What instruction could be sought either from Mercury
or Minerva, when Virtue already possessed all in herself? Virtue, indeed, is defined by the
ancients as itself the art of living well and rightly. Hence, because virtue is called in Greek
ἀρετη, it has been thought the Latins have derived from it the term art. But if Virtue cannot
come except to the clever, what need was there of the god Father Catius, who should make
men cautious, that is, acute, when Felicity could confer this? Because, to be born clever
belongs to felicity. Whence, although goddess Felicity could not be worshipped by one not
yet born, in order that, being made his friend, she might bestow this on him, yet she might
confer this favor on parents who were her worshippers, that clever children should be born
to them. What need had women in childbirth to invoke Lucina, when, if Felicity should be
present, they would have, not only a good delivery, but good children too? What need was
there to commend the children to the goddess Ops when they were being born; to the god
Vaticanus in their birth-cry; to the goddess Cunina when lying cradled; to the goddess
Rimina when sucking; to the god Statilinus when standing; to the goddess Adeona when
coming; to Abeona when going away; to the goddess Mens that they might have a good
mind; to the god Volumnus, and the goddess Volumna, that they might wish for good things;
to the nuptial gods, that they might make good matches; to the rural gods, and chiefly to
the goddess Fructesca herself, that they might receive the most abundant fruits; to Mars and
Bellona, that they might carry on war well; to the goddess Victoria, that they might be victorious;
to the god Honor, that they might be honored; to the goddess Pecunia, that they
might have plenty money; to the god Aesculanus, and his son Argentinus, that they might
have brass and silver coin? For they set down Aesculanus as the father of Argentinus for
this reason, that brass coin began to be used before silver. But I wonder Argentinus has not
begotten Aurinus, since gold coin also has followed. Could they have him for a god, they
would prefer Aurinus both to his father Argentinus and his grandfather Aesculanus, just as
they set Jove before Saturn. Therefore, what necessity was there on account of these gifts,

<pb n="188"/>
either of soul, or body, or outward estate, to worship and invoke so great a crowd of gods,
all of whom I have not mentioned, nor have they themselves been able to provide for all
human benefits, minutely and singly methodized, minute and single gods, when the one
goddess Felicity was able, with the greatest ease, compendiously to bestow the whole of
them? nor should any other be sought after, either for the bestowing of good things, or for
the averting of evil. For why should they invoke the goddess Fessonia for the weary; for
driving away enemies, the goddess Pellonia; for the sick, as a physician, either Apollo or
Æsculapius, or both together if there should be great danger? Neither should the god Spiniensis
be entreated that he might root out the thorns from the fields; nor the goddess Rubigo
that the mildew might not come,—Felicitas alone being present and guarding, either no
evils would have arisen, or they would have been quite easily driven away. Finally, since we
treat of these two goddesses, Virtue and Felicity, if felicity is the reward of virtue, she is not
a goddess, but a gift of God. But if she is a goddess, why may she not be said to confer virtue
itself, inasmuch as it is a great felicity to attain virtue?</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Concerning the Knowledge of the Worship Due to the Gods, Which
Varro Glories in Having Himself Conferred on the Romans.</head>
<p>What is it, then, that Varro boasts he has bestowed as a very great benefit on his fellowcitizens,
because he not only recounts the gods who ought to be worshipped by the Romans,
but also tells what pertains to each of them? “Just as it is of no advantage,” he says, “to know
the name and appearance of any man who is a physician, and not know that he is a physician,
so,” he says, “it is of no advantage to know well that Æsculapius is a god, if you are not aware
that he can bestow the gift of health, and consequently do not know why you ought to supplicate
him.” He also affirms this by another comparison, saying, “No one is able, not only
to live well, but even to live at all, if he does not know who is a smith, who a baker, who a
weaver, from whom he can seek any utensil, whom he may take for a helper, whom for a
leader, whom for a teacher;” asserting, “that in this way it can be doubtful to no one, that
thus the knowledge of the gods is useful, if one can know what force, and faculty, or power
any god may have in any thing. For from this we may be able,” he says, “to know what god
we ought to call to, and invoke for any cause; lest we should do as too many are wont to do,
and desire water from Liber, and wine from Lymphs.” Very useful, forsooth! Who would
not give this man thanks if he could show true things, and if he could teach that the one
true God, from whom all good things are, is to be worshipped by men?</p>

<pb n="190"/>
<head>Chapter 23.—Concerning Felicity, Whom the Romans, Who Venerate Many Gods,
for a Long Time Did Not Worship with Divine Honor, Though She Alone Would
Have Sufficed Instead of All.</head>
<p>But how does it happen, if their books and rituals are true, and Felicity is a goddess,
that she herself is not appointed as the only one to be worshipped, since she could confer
all things, and all at once make men happy? For who wishes anything for any other reason
than that he may become happy? Why was it left to Lucullus to dedicate a temple to so great
a goddess at so late a date, and after so many Roman rulers? Why did Romulus himself,
ambitious as he was of founding a fortunate city, not erect a temple to this goddess before
all others? Why did he supplicate the other gods for anything, since he would have lacked
nothing had she been with him? For even he himself would neither have been first a king,
then afterwards, as they think, a god, if this goddess had not been propitious to him. Why,
therefore, did he appoint as gods for the Romans, Janus, Jove, Mars, Picus, Faunus, Tibernus,
Hercules, and others, if there were more of them? Why did Titus Tatius add Saturn, Ops,
Sun, Moon, Vulcan, Light, and whatever others he added, among whom was even the goddess
Cloacina, while Felicity was neglected? Why did Numa appoint so many gods and so many
goddesses without this one? Was it perhaps because he could not see her among so great a
crowd? Certainly king Hostilius would not have introduced the new gods Fear and Dread
to be propitiated, if he could have known or might have worshipped this goddess. For, in
presence of Felicity, Fear and Dread would have disappeared,—I do not say propitiated, but
put to flight. Next, I ask, how is it that the Roman empire had already immensely increased
before any one worshipped Felicity? Was the empire, therefore, more great than happy?
For how could true felicity be there, where there was not true piety? For piety is the genuine
worship of the true God, and not the worship of as many demons as there are false gods.
Yet even afterwards, when Felicity had already been taken into the number of the gods, the
great infelicity of the civil wars ensued. Was Felicity perhaps justly indignant, both because
she was invited so late, and was invited not to honor, but rather to reproach, because along
with her were worshipped Priapus, and Cloacina, and Fear and Dread, and Ague, and others
which were not gods to be worshipped, but the crimes of the worshippers? Last of all, if it
seemed good to worship so great a goddess along with a most unworthy crowd, why at least
was she not worshipped in a more honorable way than the rest? For is it not intolerable
that Felicity is placed neither among the gods Consentes,176 whom they allege to be admitted
into the council of Jupiter, nor among the gods whom they term Select? Some temple might
be made for her which might be pre-eminent, both in loftiness of site and dignity of style.
Why, indeed, not something better than is made for Jupiter himself? For who gave the
kingdom even to Jupiter but Felicity? I am supposing that when he reigned he was happy.
<note type="footnote">176 So called from the consent or harmony of the celestial movements of these gods.</note>

<pb n="191"/>
Felicity, however, is certainly more valuable than a kingdom. For no one doubts that a man
might easily be found who may fear to be made a king; but no one is found who is unwilling
to be happy. Therefore, if it is thought they can be consulted by augury, or in any other
way, the gods themselves should be consulted about this thing, whether they may wish to
give place to Felicity. If, perchance, the place should already be occupied by the temples
and altars of others, where a greater and more lofty temple might be built to Felicity, even
Jupiter himself might give way, so that Felicity might rather obtain the very pinnacle of the
Capitoline hill. For there is not any one who would resist Felicity, except, which is impossible,
one who might wish to be unhappy. Certainly, if he should be consulted, Jupiter would in
no case do what those three gods, Mars, Terminus, and Juventas, did, who positively refused
to give place to their superior and king. For, as their books record, when king Tarquin
wished to construct the Capitol, and perceived that the place which seemed to him to be
the most worthy and suitable was preoccupied by other gods, not daring to do anything
contrary to their pleasure, and believing that they would willingly give place to a god who
was so great, and was their own master, because there were many of them there when the
Capitol was founded, he inquired by augury whether they chose to give place to Jupiter, and
they were all willing to remove thence except those whom I have named, Mars, Terminus,
and Juventas; and therefore the Capitol was built in such a way that these three also might
be within it, yet with such obscure signs that even the most learned men could scarcely know
this. Surely, then, Jupiter himself would by no means despise Felicity, as he was himself
despised by Terminus, Mars, and Juventas. But even they themselves who had not given
place to Jupiter, would certainly give place to Felicity, who had made Jupiter king over them.
Or if they should not give place, they would act thus not out of contempt of her, but because
they chose rather to be obscure in the house of Felicity, than to be eminent without her in
their own places.</p>
<p>Thus the goddess Felicity being established in the largest and loftiest place, the citizens
should learn whence the furtherance of every good desire should be sought. And so, by the
persuasion of nature herself, the superfluous multitude of other gods being abandoned,
Felicity alone would be worshipped, prayer would be made to her alone, her temple alone
would be frequented by the citizens who wished to be happy, which no one of them would
not wish; and thus felicity, who was sought for from all the gods, would be sought for only
from her own self. For who wishes to receive from any god anything else than felicity, or
what he supposes to tend to felicity? Wherefore, if Felicity has it in her power to be with
what man she pleases (and she has it if she is a goddess), what folly is it, after all, to seek
from any other god her whom you can obtain by request from her own self! Therefore they
ought to honor this goddess above other gods, even by dignity of place. For, as we read in
their own authors, the ancient Romans paid greater honors to I know not what Summanus,
to whom they attributed nocturnal thunderbolts, than to Jupiter, to whom diurnal thunder-

<pb n="192"/>
bolts were held to pertain. But, after a famous and conspicuous temple had been built to
Jupiter, owing to the dignity of the building, the multitude resorted to him in so great
numbers, that scarce one can be found who remembers even to have read the name of
Summanus, which now he cannot once hear named. But if Felicity is not a goddess, because,
as is true, it is a gift of God, that god must be sought who has power to give it, and that
hurtful multitude of false gods must be abandoned which the vain multitude of foolish men
follows after, making gods to itself of the gifts of God, and offending Himself whose gifts
they are by the stubbornness of a proud will. For he cannot be free from infelicity who
worships Felicity as a goddess, and forsakes God, the giver of felicity; just as he cannot be
free from hunger who licks a painted loaf of bread, and does not buy it of the man who has
a real one.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—The Reasons by Which the Pagans Attempt to Defend Their Worshipping

<p>We may, however, consider their reasons. Is it to be believed, say they, that our forefathers
were besotted even to such a degree as not to know that these things are divine gifts, and
not gods? But as they knew that such things are granted to no one, except by some god
freely bestowing them, they called the gods whose names they did not find out by the names
of those things which they deemed to be given by them; sometimes slightly altering the
name for that purpose, as, for example, from war they have named Bellona, not bellum;
from cradles, Cunina, not cunæ; from standing corn, Segetia, not seges; from apples, Pomona,
not pomum; from oxen, Bubona, not bos. Sometimes, again, with no alteration of the word,
just as the things themselves are named, so that the goddess who gives money is called Pecunia,
and money is not thought to be itself a goddess: so of Virtus, who gives virtue;
Honor, who gives honor; Concordia, who gives concord; Victoria, who gives victory. So,
they say, when Felicitas is called a goddess, what is meant is not the thing itself which is
given, but that deity by whom felicity is given.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Concerning the One God Only to Be Worshipped, Who, Although
His Name is Unknown, is Yet Deemed to Be the Giver of Felicity.</head>
<p>Having had that reason rendered to us, we shall perhaps much more easily persuade,
as we wish, those whose heart has not become too much hardened. For if now human infirmity
has perceived that felicity cannot be given except by some god; if this was perceived
by those who worshipped so many gods, at whose head they set Jupiter himself; if, in their
ignorance of the name of Him by whom felicity was given, they agreed to call Him by the
name of that very thing which they believed He gave;—then it follows that they thought
that felicity could not be given even by Jupiter himself, whom they already worshipped, but
certainly by him whom they thought fit to worship under the name of Felicity itself. I
thoroughly affirm the statement that they believed felicity to be given by a certain God whom
they knew not: let Him therefore be sought after, let Him be worshipped, and it is enough.
Let the train of innumerable demons be repudiated, and let this God suffice every man
whom his gift suffices. For him, I say, God the giver of felicity will not be enough to worship,
for whom felicity itself is not enough to receive. But let him for whom it suffices (and man
has nothing more he ought to wish for) serve the one God, the giver of felicity. This God
is not he whom they call Jupiter. For if they acknowledged him to be the giver of felicity,
they would not seek, under the name of Felicity itself, for another god or goddess by whom
felicity might be given; nor could they tolerate that Jupiter himself should be worshipped
with such infamous attributes. For he is said to be the debaucher of the wives of others; he
is the shameless lover and ravisher of a beautiful boy.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—Of the Scenic Plays, the Celebration of Which the Gods Have Exacted
from Their Worshippers.</head>
<p>“But,” says Cicero, “Homer invented these things, and transferred things human to the
gods: I would rather transfer things divine to us.”177 The poet, by ascribing such crimes
to the gods, has justly displeased the grave man. Why, then, are the scenic plays, where
these crimes are habitually spoken of, acted, exhibited, in honor of the gods, reckoned among
things divine by the most learned men? Cicero should exclaim, not against the inventions
of the poets, but against the customs of the ancients. Would not they have exclaimed in
reply, What have we done? The gods themselves have loudly demanded that these plays
should be exhibited in their honor, have fiercely exacted them, have menaced destruction
unless this was performed, have avenged its neglect with great severity, and have manifested
pleasure at the reparation of such neglect. Among their virtuous and wonderful deeds the
following is related. It was announced in a dream to Titus Latinius, a Roman rustic, that
he should go to the senate and tell them to recommence the games of Rome, because on the
first day of their celebration a condemned criminal had been led to punishment in sight of
the people, an incident so sad as to disturb the gods who were seeking amusement from the
games. And when the peasant who had received this intimation was afraid on the following
day to deliver it to the senate, it was renewed next night in a severer form: he lost his son,
because of his neglect. On the third night he was warned that a yet graver punishment was
impending, if he should still refuse obedience. When even thus he did not dare to obey, he
fell into a virulent and horrible disease. But then, on the advice of his friends, he gave information
to the magistrates, and was carried in a litter into the senate, and having, on declaring
his dream, immediately recovered strength, went away on his own feet whole.178
The senate, amazed at so great a miracle, decreed that the games should be renewed at
fourfold cost. What sensible man does not see that men, being put upon by malignant
demons, from whose domination nothing save the grace of God through Jesus Christ our
Lord sets free, have been compelled by force to exhibit to such gods as these, plays which,
if well advised, they should condemn as shameful? Certain it is that in these plays the poetic
crimes of the gods are celebrated, yet they are plays which were re-established by decree of
the senate, under compulsion of the gods. In these plays the most shameless actors celebrated
Jupiter as the corrupter of chastity, and thus gave him pleasure. If that was a fiction, he
would have been moved to anger; but if he was delighted with the representation of his
crimes, even although fabulous, then, when he happened to be worshipped, who but the
devil could be served? Is it so that he could found, extend, and preserve the Roman empire,
who was more vile than any Roman man whatever, to whom such things were displeasing?

<head>Chapter 27.—Concerning the Three Kinds of Gods About Which the Pontiff Scævola
Has Discoursed.</head>
<p>It is recorded that the very learned pontiff Scævola179 had distinguished about three
kinds of gods—one introduced by the poets, another by the philosophers, another by the
statesmen. The first kind he declares to be trifling, because many unworthy things have
been invented by the poets concerning the gods; the second does not suit states, because it
contains some things that are superfluous, and some, too, which it would be prejudicial for
the people to know. It is no great matter about the superfluous things, for it is a common
saying of skillful lawyers, “Superfluous things do no harm.”180 But what are those things
which do harm when brought before the multitude? “These,” he says, “that Hercules, Æsculapius,
Castor and Pollux, are not gods; for it is declared by learned men that these were
but men, and yielded to the common lot of mortals.” What else? “That states have not the
true images of the gods; because the true God has neither sex, nor age, nor definite corporeal
members.” The pontiff is not willing that the people should know these things; for he does
not think they are false. He thinks it expedient, therefore, that states should be deceived in
matters of religion; which Varro himself does not even hesitate to say in his books about
things divine. Excellent religion! to which the weak, who requires to be delivered, may flee
for succor; and when he seeks for the truth by which he may be delivered, it is believed to
be expedient for him that he be deceived. And, truly, in these same books, Scævola is not
silent as to his reason for rejecting the poetic sort of gods,—to wit, “because they so disfigure
the gods that they could not bear comparison even with good men, when they make one to
commit theft, another adultery; or, again, to say or do something else basely and foolishly;
as that three goddesses contested (with each other) the prize of beauty, and the two vanquished
by Venus destroyed Troy; that Jupiter turned himself into a bull or swan that he
might copulate with some one; that a goddess married a man, and Saturn devoured his
children; that, in fine, there is nothing that could be imagined, either of the miraculous or
vicious, which may not be found there, and yet is far removed from the nature of the gods.”
O chief pontiff Scævola, take away the plays if thou art able; instruct the people that they
may not offer such honors to the immortal gods, in which, if they like, they may admire the
crimes of the gods, and, so far as it is possible, may, if they please, imitate them. But if the
people shall have answered thee, You, O pontiff, have brought these things in among us,
then ask the gods themselves at whose instigation you have ordered these things, that they
may not order such things to be offered to them. For if they are bad, and therefore in no
way to be believed concerning the majority of the gods, the greater is the wrong done the

gods about whom they are feigned with impunity. But they do not hear thee, they are
demons, they teach wicked things, they rejoice in vile things; not only do they not count it
a wrong if these things are feigned about them, but it is a wrong they are quite unable to
bear if they are not acted at their stated festivals. But now, if thou wouldst call on Jupiter
against them, chiefly for that reason that more of his crimes are wont to be acted in the
scenic plays, is it not the case that, although you call him god Jupiter, by whom this whole
world is ruled and administered, it is he to whom the greatest wrong is done by you, because
you have thought he ought to be worshipped along with them, and have styled him their
king?</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Whether the Worship of the Gods Has Been of Service to the Romans
in Obtaining and Extending the Empire.</head>
<p>Therefore such gods, who are propitiated by such honors, or rather are impeached by
them (for it is a greater crime to delight in having such things said of them falsely, than even
if they could be said truly), could never by any means have been able to increase and preserve
the Roman empire. For if they could have done it, they would rather have bestowed so
grand a gift on the Greeks, who, in this kind of divine things,—that is, in scenic plays,—have
worshipped them more honorably and worthily, although they have not exempted themselves
from those slanders of the poets, by whom they saw the gods torn in pieces, giving them licence
to ill-use any man they pleased, and have not deemed the scenic players themselves
to be base, but have held them worthy even of distinguished honor. But just as the Romans
were able to have gold money, although they did not worship a god Aurinus, so also they
could have silver and brass coin, and yet worship neither Argentinus nor his father Aesculanus;
and so of all the rest, which it would be irksome for me to detail. It follows, therefore,
both that they could not by any means attain such dominion if the true God was unwilling;
and that if these gods, false and many, were unknown or contemned, and He alone was
known and worshipped with sincere faith and virtue, they would both have a better kingdom
here, whatever might be its extent, and whether they might have one here or not, would afterwards
receive an eternal kingdom.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—Of the Falsity of the Augury by Which the Strength and Stability of
the Roman Empire Was Considered to Be Indicated.</head>
<p>For what kind of augury is that which they have declared to be most beautiful, and to
which I referred a little ago, that Mars, and Terminus, and Juventas would not give place
even to Jove, the king of the gods? For thus, they say, it was signified that the nation dedicated
to Mars,—that is, the Roman,—should yield to none the place it once occupied; likewise,
that on account of the god Terminus, no one would be able to disturb the Roman frontiers;
and also, that the Roman youth, because of the goddess Juventas, should yield to no one.
Let them see, therefore, how they can hold him to be the king of their gods, and the giver
of their own kingdom, if these auguries set him down for an adversary, to whom it would
have been honorable not to yield. However, if these things are true, they need not be at all
afraid. For they are not going to confess that the gods who would not yield to Jove have
yielded to Christ. For, without altering the boundaries of the empire, Jesus Christ has proved
Himself able to drive them, not only from their temples, but from the hearts of their worshippers.
But, before Christ came in the flesh, and, indeed, before these things which we
have quoted from their books could have been written, but yet after that auspice was made
under king Tarquin, the Roman army has been divers times scattered or put to flight, and
has shown the falseness of the auspice, which they derived from the fact that the goddess
Juventas had not given place to Jove; and the nation dedicated to Mars was trodden down
in the city itself by the invading and triumphant Gauls; and the boundaries of the empire,
through the falling away of many cities to Hannibal, had been hemmed into a narrow space.
Thus the beauty of the auspices is made void, and there has remained only the contumacy
against Jove, not of gods, but of demons. For it is one thing not to have yielded, and another
to have returned whither you have yielded. Besides, even afterwards, in the oriental regions,
the boundaries of the Roman empire were changed by the will of Hadrian; for he yielded
up to the Persian empire those three noble provinces, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria.
Thus that god Terminus, who according to these books was the guardian of the Roman
frontiers, and by that most beautiful auspice had not given place to Jove, would seem to
have been more afraid of Hadrian, a king of men, than of the king of the gods. The aforesaid
provinces having also been taken back again, almost within our own recollection the frontier
fell back, when Julian, given up to the oracles of their gods, with immoderate daring ordered
the victualling ships to be set on fire. The army being thus left destitute of provisions, and
he himself also being presently killed by the enemy, and the legions being hard pressed,
while dismayed by the loss of their commander, they were reduced to such extremities that
no one could have escaped, unless by articles of peace the boundaries of the empire had
then been established where they still remain; not, indeed, with so great a loss as was suffered
by the concession of Hadrian, but still at a considerable sacrifice. It was a vain augury, then,
that the god Terminus did not yield to Jove, since he yielded to the will of Hadrian, and

<pb n="201"/>
yielded also to the rashness of Julian, and the necessity of Jovinian. The more intelligent
and grave Romans have seen these things, but have had little power against the custom of
the state, which was bound to observe the rites of the demons; because even they themselves,
although they perceived that these things were vain, yet thought that the religious worship
which is due to God should be paid to the nature of things which is established under the
rule and government of the one true God, “serving,” as saith the apostle, “the creature more
than the Creator, who is blessed for evermore.”181 The help of this true God was necessary
to send holy and truly pious men, who would die for the true religion that they might remove
the false from among the living.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—What Kind of Things Even Their Worshippers Have Owned They
Have Thought About the Gods of the Nations.</head>
<p>Cicero the augur laughs at auguries, and reproves men for regulating the purposes of
life by the cries of crows and jackdaws.182 But it will be said that an academic philosopher,
who argues that all things are uncertain, is unworthy to have any authority in these matters.
In the second book of his De Natura Deorum,183 he introduces Lucilius Balbus, who, after
showing that superstitions have their origin in physical and philosophical truths, expresses
his indignation at the setting up of images and fabulous notions, speaking thus: “Do you
not therefore see that from true and useful physical discoveries the reason may be drawn
away to fabulous and imaginary gods? This gives birth to false opinions and turbulent errors,
and superstitions well-nigh old-wifeish. For both the forms of the gods, and their ages, and
clothing, and ornaments, are made familiar to us; their genealogies, too, their marriages,
kinships, and all things about them, are debased to the likeness of human weakness. They
are even introduced as having perturbed minds; for we have accounts of the lusts, cares,
and angers of the gods. Nor, indeed, as the fables go, have the gods been without their wars
and battles. And that not only when, as in Homer, some gods on either side have defended
two opposing armies, but they have even carried on wars on their own account, as with the
Titans or with the Giants. Such things it is quite absurd either to say or to believe: they are
utterly frivolous and groundless.” Behold, now, what is confessed by those who defend the
gods of the nations. Afterwards he goes on to say that some things belong to superstition,
but others to religion, which he thinks good to teach according to the Stoics. “For not only
the philosophers,” he says, “but also our forefathers, have made a distinction between superstition
and religion. For those,” he says, “who spent whole days in prayer, and offered sacrifice,
that their children might outlive them, are called superstitious.”184 Who does not
see that he is trying, while he fears the public prejudice, to praise the religion of the ancients,
and that he wishes to disjoin it from superstition, but cannot find out how to do so? For if
those who prayed and sacrificed all day were called superstitious by the ancients, were those
also called so who instituted (what he blames) the images of the gods of diverse age and
distinct clothing, and invented the genealogies of gods, their marriages, and kinships?
When, therefore, these things are found fault with as superstitious, he implicates in that
fault the ancients who instituted and worshipped such images. Nay, he implicates himself,
who, with whatever eloquence he may strive to extricate himself and be free, was yet under
the necessity of venerating these images; nor dared he so much as whisper in a discourse to
the people what in this disputation he plainly sounds forth. Let us Christians, therefore,

Him who has made heaven and earth; because these superstitions, which that Balbus, like
a babbler,185 scarcely reprehends, He, by the most deep lowliness of Christ, by the preaching
of the apostles, by the faith of the martyrs dying for the truth and living with the truth, has
overthrown, not only in the hearts of the religious, but even in the temples of the superstitious,
by their own free service.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Concerning the Opinions of Varro, Who, While Reprobating the
Popular Belief, Thought that Their Worship Should Be Confined to One God,
Though He Was Unable to Discover the True God.</head>
<p>What says Varro himself, whom we grieve to have found, although not by his own
judgment, placing the scenic plays among things divine? When in many passages he is exhorting,
like a religious man, to the worship of the gods, does he not in doing so admit that
he does not in his own judgment believe those things which he relates that the Roman state
has instituted; so that he does not hesitate to affirm that if he were founding a new state, he
could enumerate the gods and their names better by the rule of nature? But being born into
a nation already ancient, he says that he finds himself bound to accept the traditional names
and surnames of the gods, and the histories connected with them, and that his purpose in
investigating and publishing these details is to incline the people to worship the gods, and
not to despise them. By which words this most acute man sufficiently indicates that he does
not publish all things, because they would not only have been contemptible to himself, but
would have seemed despicable even to the rabble, unless they had been passed over in silence.
I should be thought to conjecture these things, unless he himself, in another passage, had
openly said, in speaking of religious rites, that many things are true which it is not only not
useful for the common people to know, but that it is expedient that the people should think
otherwise, even though falsely, and therefore the Greeks have shut up the religious ceremonies
and mysteries in silence, and within walls. In this he no doubt expresses the policy of the
so-called wise men by whom states and peoples are ruled. Yet by this crafty device the malign
demons are wonderfully delighted, who possess alike the deceivers and the deceived, and
from whose tyranny nothing sets free save the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>The same most acute and learned author also says, that those alone seem to him to have
perceived what God is, who have believed Him to be the soul of the world, governing it by
design and reason.186 And by this, it appears, that although he did not attain to the
truth,—for the true God is not a soul, but the maker and author of the soul,—yet if he could
have been free to go against the prejudices of custom, he could have confessed and counselled
others that the one God ought to be worshipped, who governs the world by design and
reason; so that on this subject only this point would remain to be debated with him, that he
had called Him a soul, and not rather the creator of the soul. He says, also, that the ancient
Romans, for more than a hundred and seventy years, worshipped the gods without an image.
187 “And if this custom,” he says, “could have remained till now, the gods would have
been more purely worshipped.” In favor of this opinion, he cites as a witness among others
the Jewish nation; nor does he hesitate to conclude that passage by saying of those who first
<note type="footnote">186 See Cicero, De Nat. Deor. i. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">187 Plutarch’s Numa, c. 8.</note>

<pb n="205"/>
consecrated images for the people, that they have both taken away religious fear from their
fellow-citizens, and increased error, wisely thinking that the gods easily fall into contempt
when exhibited under the stolidity of images. But as he does not say they have transmitted
error, but that they have increased it, he therefore wishes it to be understood that there was
error already when there were no images. Wherefore, when he says they alone have perceived
what God is who have believed Him to be the governing soul of the world, and thinks that
the rites of religion would have been more purely observed without images, who fails to see
how near he has come to the truth? For if he had been able to do anything against so inveterate
an error, he would certainly have given it as his opinion both that the one God should
be worshipped, and that He should be worshipped without an image; and having so nearly
discovered the truth, perhaps he might easily have been put in mind of the mutability of the
soul, and might thus have perceived that the true God is that immutable nature which made
the soul itself. Since these things are so, whatever ridicule such men have poured in their
writings against the plurality of the gods, they have done so rather as compelled by the secret
will of God to confess them, than as trying to persuade others. If, therefore, any testimonies
are adduced by us from these writings, they are adduced for the confutation of those who
are unwilling to consider from how great and malignant a power of the demons the singular
sacrifice of the shedding of the most holy blood, and the gift of the imparted Spirit, can set
us free.</p>

<p>Varro says also, concerning the generations of the gods, that the people have inclined
to the poets rather than to the natural philosophers; and that therefore their forefathers,—that
is, the ancient Romans,—believed both in the sex and the generations of the gods, and settled
their marriages; which certainly seems to have been done for no other cause except that it
was the business of such men as were prudent and wise to deceive the people in matters of
religion, and in that very thing not only to worship, but also to imitate the demons, whose
greatest lust is to deceive. For just as the demons cannot possess any but those whom they
have deceived with guile, so also men in princely office, not indeed being just, but like
demons, have persuaded the people in the name of religion to receive as true those things
which they themselves knew to be false; in this way, as it were, binding them up more firmly
in civil society, so that they might in like manner possess them as subjects. But who that
was weak and unlearned could escape the deceits of both the princes of the state and the
demons?</p>

<p>Therefore that God, the author and giver of felicity, because He alone is the true God,
Himself gives earthly kingdoms both to good and bad. Neither does He do this rashly, and,
as it were, fortuitously,—because He is God not fortune,—but according to the order of
things and times, which is hidden from us, but thoroughly known to Himself; which same
order of times, however, He does not serve as subject to it, but Himself rules as lord and
appoints as governor. Felicity He gives only to the good. Whether a man be a subject or a
king makes no difference; he may equally either possess or not possess it. And it shall be
full in that life where kings and subjects exist no longer. And therefore earthly kingdoms
are given by Him both to the good and the bad; lest His worshippers, still under the conduct
of a very weak mind, should covet these gifts from Him as some great things. And this is
the mystery of the Old Testament, in which the New was hidden, that there even earthly
gifts are promised: those who were spiritual understanding even then, although not yet
openly declaring, both the eternity which was symbolized by these earthly things, and in

<p>Therefore, that it might be known that these earthly good things, after which those pant
who cannot imagine better things, remain in the power of the one God Himself, not of the
many false gods whom the Romans have formerly believed worthy of worship, He multiplied
His people in Egypt from being very few, and delivered them out of it by wonderful signs.
Nor did their women invoke Lucina when their offspring was being incredibly multiplied;
and that nation having increased incredibly, He Himself delivered, He Himself saved them
from the hands of the Egyptians, who persecuted them, and wished to kill all their infants.
Without the goddess Rumina they sucked; without Cunina they were cradled, without Educa
and Potina they took food and drink; without all those puerile gods they were educated;
without the nuptial gods they were married; without the worship of Priapus they had conjugal
intercourse; without invocation of Neptune the divided sea opened up a way for them to
pass over, and overwhelmed with its returning waves their enemies who pursued them.
Neither did they consecrate any goddess Mannia when they received manna from heaven;
nor, when the smitten rock poured forth water to them when they thirsted, did they worship
Nymphs and Lymphs. Without the mad rites of Mars and Bellona they carried on war; and
while, indeed, they did not conquer without victory, yet they did not hold it to be a goddess,
but the gift of their God. Without Segetia they had harvests; without Bubona, oxen; honey
without Mellona; apples without Pomona: and, in a word, everything for which the Romans
thought they must supplicate so great a crowd of false gods, they received much more happily
from the one true God. And if they had not sinned against Him with impious curiosity,
which seduced them like magic arts, and drew them to strange gods and idols, and at last
led them to kill Christ, their kingdom would have remained to them, and would have been,
if not more spacious, yet more happy, than that of Rome. And now that they are dispersed
through almost all lands and nations, it is through the providence of that one true God; that
whereas the images, altars, groves, and temples of the false gods are everywhere overthrown,
and their sacrifices prohibited, it may be shown from their books how this has been foretold
by their prophets so long before; lest, perhaps, when they should be read in ours, they might
seem to be invented by us. But now, reserving what is to follow for the following book, we

<head>Chapter 1.—That the Cause of the Roman Empire, and of All Kingdoms, is Neither
Fortuitous Nor Consists in the Position of the Stars.189</head>
<p>The cause, then, of the greatness of the Roman empire is neither fortuitous nor fatal,
according to the judgment or opinion of those who call those things fortuitous which either
have no causes, or such causes as do not proceed from some intelligible order, and those
things fatal which happen independently of the will of God and man, by the necessity of a
certain order. In a word, human kingdoms are established by divine providence. And if
any one attributes their existence to fate, because he calls the will or the power of God itself
by the name of fate, let him keep his opinion, but correct his language. For why does he
not say at first what he will say afterwards, when some one shall put the question to him,
What he means by fate? For when men hear that word, according to the ordinary use of
the language, they simply understand by it the virtue of that particular position of the stars
which may exist at the time when any one is born or conceived, which some separate altogether
from the will of God, whilst others affirm that this also is dependent on that will.
But those who are of opinion that, apart from the will of God, the stars determine what we
shall do, or what good things we shall possess, or what evils we shall suffer, must be refused
a hearing by all, not only by those who hold the true religion, but by those who wish to be
the worshippers of any gods whatsoever, even false gods. For what does this opinion really
amount to but this, that no god whatever is to be worshipped or prayed to? Against these,
however, our present disputation is not intended to be directed, but against those who, in
defence of those whom they think to be gods, oppose the Christian religion. They, however,
who make the position of the stars depend on the divine will, and in a manner decree what
character each man shall have, and what good or evil shall happen to him, if they think that
these same stars have that power conferred upon them by the supreme power of God, in
order that they may determine these things according to their will, do a great injury to the
celestial sphere, in whose most brilliant senate, and most splendid senate-house, as it were,
they suppose that wicked deeds are decreed to be done,—such deeds as that, if any terrestrial
state should decree them, it would be condemned to overthrow by the decree of the whole
human race. What judgment, then, is left to God concerning the deeds of men, who is Lord
both of the stars and of men, when to these deeds a celestial necessity is attributed? Or, if
they do not say that the stars, though they have indeed received a certain power from God,
who is supreme, determine those things according to their own discretion, but simply that
His commands are fulfilled by them instrumentally in the application and enforcing of such
necessities, are we thus to think concerning God even what it seemed unworthy that we
should think concerning the will of the stars? But, if the stars are said rather to signify these

things than to effect them, so that that position of the stars is, as it were, a kind of speech
predicting, not causing future things,—for this has been the opinion of men of no ordinary
learning,—certainly the mathematicians are not wont so to speak saying, for example, Mars
in such or such a position signifies a homicide, but makes a homicide. But, nevertheless,
though we grant that they do not speak as they ought, and that we ought to accept as the
proper form of speech that employed by the philosophers in predicting those things which
they think they discover in the position of the stars, how comes it that they have never been
able to assign any cause why, in the life of twins, in their actions, in the events which befall
them, in their professions, arts, honors, and other things pertaining to human life, also in
their very death, there is often so great a difference, that, as far as these things are concerned,
many entire strangers are more like them than they are like each other, though separated
at birth by the smallest interval of time, but at conception generated by the same act of
copulation, and at the same moment?</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—On the Difference in the Health of Twins.</head>
<p>Cicero says that the famous physician Hippocrates has left in writing that he had suspected
that a certain pair of brothers were twins, from the fact that they both took ill at once,
and their disease advanced to its crisis and subsided in the same time in each of them.190
Posidonius the Stoic, who was much given to astrology, used to explain the fact by supposing
that they had been born and conceived under the same constellation. In this question the
conjecture of the physician is by far more worthy to be accepted, and approaches much
nearer to credibility, since, according as the parents were affected in body at the time of
copulation, so might the first elements of the foetuses have been affected, so that all that was
necessary for their growth and development up till birth having been supplied from the
body of the same mother, they might be born with like constitutions. Thereafter, nourished
in the same house, on the same kinds of food, where they would have also the same kinds
of air, the same locality, the same quality of water,—which, according to the testimony of
medical science, have a very great influence, good or bad, on the condition of bodily
health,—and where they would also be accustomed to the same kinds of exercise, they would
have bodily constitutions so similar that they would be similarly affected with sickness at
the same time and by the same causes. But, to wish to adduce that particular position of
the stars which existed at the time when they were born or conceived as the cause of their
being simultaneously affected with sickness, manifests the greatest arrogance, when so many
beings of most diverse kinds, in the most diverse conditions, and subject to the most diverse
events, may have been conceived and born at the same time, and in the same district, lying
under the same sky. But we know that twins do not only act differently, and travel to very
different places, but that they also suffer from different kinds of sickness; for which Hippocrates
would give what is in my opinion the simplest reason, namely, that, through diversity
of food and exercise, which arises not from the constitution of the body, but from the inclination
of the mind, they may have come to be different from each other in respect of health.
Moreover, Posidonius, or any other asserter of the fatal influence of the stars, will have
enough to do to find anything to say to this, if he be unwilling to im pose upon the minds
of the uninstructed in things of which they are ignorant. But, as to what they attempt to
make out from that very small interval of time elapsing between the births of twins, on account
of that point in the heavens where the mark of the natal hour is placed, and which
they call the “horoscope,” it is either disproportionately small to the diversity which is found
in the dispositions, actions, habits, and fortunes of twins, or it is disproportionately great
when compared with the estate of twins, whether low or high, which is the same for both
of them, the cause for whose greatest difference they place, in every case, in the hour on

which one is born; and, for this reason, if the one is born so immediately after the other that
there is no change in the horoscope, I demand an entire similarity in all that respects them
both, which can never be found in the case of any twins. But if the slowness of the birth of
the second give time for a change in the horoscope, I demand different parents, which twins
can never have.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Concerning the Arguments Which Nigidius the Mathematician Drew
from the Potter’s Wheel, in the Question About the Birth of Twins.</head>
<p>It is to no purpose, therefore, that that famous fiction about the potter’s wheel is brought
forward, which tells of the answer which Nigidius is said to have given when he was perplexed
with this question, and on account of which he was called Figulus.191 For, having whirled
round the potter’s wheel with all his strength he marked it with ink, striking it twice with
the utmost rapidity, so that the strokes seemed to fall on the very same part of it. Then,
when the rotation had ceased, the marks which he had made were found upon the rim of
the wheel at no small distance apart. Thus, said he, considering the great rapidity with which
the celestial sphere revolves, even though twins were born with as short an interval between
their births as there was between the strokes which I gave this wheel, that brief interval of
time is equivalent to a very great distance in the celestial sphere. Hence, said he, come
whatever dissimilitudes may be remarked in the habits and fortunes of twins. This argument
is more fragile than the vessels which are fashioned by the rotation of that wheel. For if
there is so much significance in the heavens which cannot be comprehended by observation
of the constellations, that, in the case of twins, an inheritance may fall to the one and not to
the other, why, in the case of others who are not twins, do they dare, having examined their
constellations, to declare such things as pertain to that secret which no one can comprehend,
and to attribute them to the precise moment of the birth of each individual? Now, if such
predictions in connection with the natal hours of others who are not twins are to be vindicated
on the ground that they are founded on the observation of more extended spaces in
the heavens, whilst those very small moments of time which separated the births of twins,
and correspond to minute portions of celestial space, are to be connected with trifling things
about which the mathematicians are not wont to be consulted,—for who would consult
them as to when he is to sit, when to walk abroad, when and on what he is to dine? —how
can we be justified in so speaking, when we can point out such manifold diversity both in
the habits, doings, and destinies of twins?</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Concerning the Twins Esau and Jacob, Who Were Very Unlike Each
Other Both in Their Character and Actions.</head>
<p>In the time of the ancient fathers, to speak concerning illustrious persons, there were
born two twin brothers, the one so immediately after the other, that the first took hold of
the heel of the second. So great a difference existed in their lives and manners, so great a
dissimilarity in their actions, so great a difference in their parents’ love for them respectively,
that the very contrast between them produced even a mutual hostile antipathy. Do we mean,
when we say that they were so unlike each other, that when the one was walking the other
was sitting, when the one was sleeping the other was waking,—which differences are such
as are attributed to those minute portions of space which cannot be appreciated by those
who note down the position of the stars which exists at the moment of one’s birth, in order
that the mathematicians may be consulted concerning it? One of these twins was for a long
time a hired servant; the other never served. One of them was beloved by his mother; the
other was not so. One of them lost that honor which was so much valued among their
people; the other obtained it. And what shall we say of their wives, their children, and their
possessions? How different they were in respect to all these! If, therefore, such things as
these are connected with those minute intervals of time which elapse between the births of
twins, and are not to be attributed to the constellations, wherefore are they predicted in the
case of others from the examination of their constellations? And if, on the other hand,
these things are said to be predicted, because they are connected, not with minute and inappreciable
moments, but with intervals of time which can be observed and noted down, what
purpose is that potter’s wheel to serve in this matter, except it be to whirl round men who
have hearts of clay, in order that they may be prevented from detecting the emptiness of the
talk of the mathematicians?</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—In What Manner the Mathematicians are Convicted of Professing a
Vain Science.</head>
<p>Do not those very persons whom the medical sagacity of Hippocrates led him to suspect
to be twins, because their disease was observed by him to develop to its crisis and to subside
again in the same time in each of them,—do not these, I say, serve as a sufficient refutation
of those who wish to attribute to the influence of the stars that which was owing to a similarity
of bodily constitution? For wherefore were they both sick of the same disease, and at
the same time, and not the one after the other in the order of their birth? (for certainly they
could not both be born at the same time.) Or, if the fact of their having been born at different
times by no means necessarily implies that they must be sick at different times, why do they
contend that the difference in the time of their births was the cause of their difference in
other things? Why could they travel in foreign parts at different times, marry at different
times, beget children at different times, and do many other things at different times, by
reason of their having been born at different times, and yet could not, for the same reason,
also be sick at different times? For if a difference in the moment of birth changed the
horoscope, and occasioned dissimilarity in all other things, why has that simultaneousness
which belonged to their conception remained in their attacks of sickness? Or, if the destinies
of health are involved in the time of conception, but those of other things be said to be attached
to the time of birth, they ought not to predict anything concerning health from examination
of the constellations of birth, when the hour of conception is not also given, that
its constellations may be inspected. But if they say that they predict attacks of sickness
without examining the horoscope of conception, because these are indicated by the moments
of birth, how could they inform either of these twins when he would be sick, from the
horoscope of his birth, when the other also, who had not the same horoscope of birth, must
of necessity fall sick at the same time? Again, I ask, if the distance of time between the births
of twins is so great as to occasion a difference of their constellations on account of the difference
of their horoscopes, and therefore of all the cardinal points to which so much influence
is attributed, that even from such change there comes a difference of destiny, how is
it possible that this should be so, since they cannot have been conceived at different times?
Or, if two conceived at the same moment of time could have different destinies with respect
to their births, why may not also two born at the same moment of time have different destinies
for life and for death? For if the one moment in which both were conceived did not
hinder that the one should be born before the other, why, if two are born at the same moment,
should anything hinder them from dying at the same moment? If a simultaneous conception
allows of twins being differently affected in the womb, why should not simultaneousness of
birth allow of any two individuals having different fortunes in the world? and thus would
all the fictions of this art, or rather delusion, be swept away. What strange circumstance is
this, that two children conceived at the same time, nay, at the same moment, under the same

<pb n="218"/>
position of the stars, have different fates which bring them to different hours of birth, whilst
two children, born of two different mothers, at the same moment of time, under one and
the same position of the stars, cannot have different fates which shall conduct them by necessity
to diverse manners of life and of death? Are they at conception as yet without destinies,
because they can only have them if they be born? What, therefore, do they mean
when they say that, if the hour of the conception be found, many things can be predicted
by these astrologers? from which also arose that story which is reiterated by some, that a
certain sage chose an hour in which to lie with his wife, in order to secure his begetting an
illustrious son. From this opinion also came that answer of Posidonius, the great astrologer
and also philosopher, concerning those twins who were attacked with sickness at the same
time, namely, “That this had happened to them because they were conceived at the same
time, and born at the same time.” For certainly he added “conception,” lest it should be said
to him that they could not both be born at the same time, knowing that at any rate they
must both have been conceived at the same time; wishing thus to show that he did not at-
tribute the fact of their being similarly and simultaneously affected with sickness to the
similarity of their bodily constitutions as its proximate cause, but that he held that even in
respect of the similarity of their health, they were bound together by a sidereal connection.
If, therefore, the time of conception has so much to do with the similarity of destinies, these
same destinies ought not to be changed by the circumstances of birth; or, if the destinies of
twins be said to be changed because they are born at different times, why should we not
rather understand that they had been already changed in order that they might be born at
different times? Does not, then, the will of men living in the world change the destinies of
birth, when the order of birth can change the destinies they had at conception?</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Concerning Twins of Different Sexes.</head>
<p>But even in the very conception of twins, which certainly occurs at the same moment
in the case of both, it often happens that the one is conceived a male, and the other a female.
I know two of different sexes who are twins. Both of them are alive, and in the flower of
their age; and though they resemble each other in body, as far as difference of sex will permit,
still they are very different in the whole scope and purpose of their lives (consideration being
had of those differences which necessarily exist between the lives of males and females),—the
one holding the office of a count, and being almost constantly away from home with the
army in foreign service, the other never leaving her country’s soil, or her native district.
Still more,—and this is more incredible, if the destinies of the stars are to be believed in,
though it is not wonderful if we consider the wills of men, and the free gifts of God,—he is
married; she is a sacred virgin: he has begotten a numerous offspring; she has never even
married. But is not the virtue of the horoscope very great? I think I have said enough to
show the absurdity of that. But, say those astrologers, whatever be the virtue of the horoscope
in other respects, it is certainly of significance with respect to birth. But why not also with
respect to conception, which takes place undoubtedly with one act of copulation? And, indeed,
so great is the force of nature, that after a woman has once conceived, she ceases to
be liable to conception. Or were they, perhaps, changed at birth, either he into a male, or
she into a female, because of the difference in their horoscopes? But, whilst it is not altogether
absurd to say that certain sidereal influences have some power to cause differences in bodies
alone,—as, for instance, we see that the seasons of the year come round by the approaching
and receding of the sun, and that certain kinds of things are increased in size or diminished
by the waxings and wanings of the moon, such as sea-urchins, oysters, and the wonderful
tides of the ocean,—it does not follow that the wills of men are to be made subject to the
position of the stars. The astrologers, however, when they wish to bind our actions also to
the constellations, only set us on investigating whether, even in these bodies, the changes
may not be attributable to some other than a sidereal cause. For what is there which more
intimately concerns a body than its sex? And yet, under the same position of the stars, twins
of different sexes may be conceived. Wherefore, what greater absurdity can be affirmed or
believed than that the position of the stars, which was the same for both of them at the time
of conception, could not cause that the one child should not have been of a different sex
from her brother, with whom she had a common constellation, whilst the position of the
stars which existed at the hour of their birth could cause that she should be separated from
him by the great distance between marriage and holy virginity?</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Concerning the Choosing of a Day for Marriage, or for Planting, or
Sowing.</head>
<p>Now, will any one bring forward this, that in choosing certain particular days for particular
actions, men bring about certain new destinies for their actions? That man, for instance,
according to this doctrine, was not born to have an illustrious son, but rather a contemptible
one, and therefore, being a man of learning, he choose an hour in which to lie with his wife.
He made, therefore, a destiny which he did not have before, and from that destiny of his
own making something began to be fatal which was not contained in the destiny of his
natal hour. Oh, singular stupidity! A day is chosen on which to marry; and for this reason,
I believe, that unless a day be chosen, the marriage may fall on an unlucky day, and turn
out an unhappy one. What then becomes of what the stars have already decreed at the hour
of birth? Can a man be said to change by an act of choice that which has already been determined
for him, whilst that which he himself has determined in the choosing of a day
cannot be changed by another power? Thus, if men alone, and not all things under heaven,
are subject to the influence of the stars, why do they choose some days as suitable for
planting vines or trees, or for sowing grain, other days as suitable for taming beasts on, or
for putting the males to the females, that the cows and mares may be impregnated, and for
such-like things? If it be said that certain chosen days have an influence on these things,
because the constellations rule over all terrestrial bodies, animate and inanimate, according
to differences in moments of time, let it be considered what innumerable multitudes of beings
are born or arise, or take their origin at the very same instant of time, which come to ends
so different, that they may persuade any little boy that these observations about days are
ridiculous. For who is so mad as to dare affirm that all trees, all herbs, all beasts, serpents,
birds, fishes, worms, have each separately their own moments of birth or commencement?
Nevertheless, men are wont, in order to try the skill of the mathematicians, to bring before
them the constellations of dumb animals, the constellations of whose birth they diligently
observe at home with a view to this discovery; and they prefer those mathematicians to all
others, who say from the inspection of the constellations that they indicate the birth of a
beast and not of a man. They also dare tell what kind of beast it is, whether it is a woolbearing
beast, or a beast suited for carrying burthens, or one fit for the plough, or for
watching a house; for the astrologers are also tried with respect to the fates of dogs, and
their answers concerning these are followed by shouts of admiration on the part of those
who consult them. They so deceive men as to make them think that during the birth of a
man the births of all other beings are suspended, so that not even a fly comes to life at the
same time that he is being born, under the same region of the heavens. And if this be admitted
with respect to the fly, the reasoning cannot stop there, but must ascend from flies till
it lead them up to camels and elephants. Nor are they willing to attend to this, that when a
day has been chosen whereon to sow a field, so many grains fall into the ground simultan-

<pb n="221"/>
eously, germinate simultaneously, spring up, come to perfection, and ripen simultaneously;
and yet, of all the ears which are coeval, and, so to speak, congerminal, some are destroyed
by mildew, some are devoured by the birds, and some are pulled by men. How can they say
that all these had their different constellations, which they see coming to so different ends?
Will they confess that it is folly to choose days for such things, and to affirm that they do
not come within the sphere of the celestial decree, whilst they subject men alone to the stars,
on whom alone in the world God has bestowed free wills? All these things being considered,
we have good reason to believe that, when the astrologers give very many wonderful answers,
it is to be attributed to the occult inspiration of spirits not of the best kind, whose care it is
to insinuate into the minds of men, and to confirm in them, those false and noxious opinions
concerning the fatal influence of the stars, and not to their marking and inspecting of
horoscopes, according to some kind of art which in reality has no existence.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Concerning Those Who Call by the Name of Fate, Not the Position of
the Stars, But the Connection of Causes Which Depends on the Will of God.</head>
<p>But, as to those who call by the name of fate, not the disposition of the stars as it may
exist when any creature is conceived, or born, or commences its existence, but the whole
connection and train of causes which makes everything become what it does become, there
is no need that I should labor and strive with them in a merely verbal controversy, since
they attribute the so-called order and connection of causes to the will and power of God
most high, who is most rightly and most truly believed to know all things before they come
to pass, and to leave nothing unordained; from whom are all powers, although the wills of
all are not from Him. Now, that it is chiefly the will of God most high, whose power extends
itself irresistibly through all things which they call fate, is proved by the following verses, of
which, if I mistake not, Annæus Seneca is the author:—
<lg>
<l>“Father supreme, Thou ruler of the lofty heavens,</l>
<l>Lead me where’er it is Thy pleasure; I will give</l>
<l>A prompt obedience, making no delay,</l>
<l>Lo! here I am. Promptly I come to do Thy sovereign will;</l>
<l>If thy command shall thwart my inclination, I will still</l>
<l>Follow Thee groaning, and the work assigned,</l>
<l>With all the suffering of a mind repugnant,</l>
<l>Will perform, being evil; which, had I been good,</l>
<l>I should have undertaken and performed, though hard,</l>
<l>With virtuous cheerfulness.</l>
<l>The Fates do lead the man that follows willing;</l>
<l>But the man that is unwilling, him they drag.”192</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Most evidently, in this last verse, he calls that “fate” which he had before called “the will
of the Father supreme,” whom, he says, he is ready to obey that he may be led, being willing,
not dragged, being unwilling, since “the Fates do lead the man that follows willing, but the
man that is unwilling, him they drag.”</p>
<p>The following Homeric lines, which Cicero translates into Latin, also favor this opinion
<lg>
<l>“Such are the minds of men, as is the light</l>
<l>Which Father Jove himself doth pour</l>
<l>Illustrious o’er the fruitful earth.”193</l>

</lg>
</p>
<note type="footnote">193 Odyssey,xviii. 136, 137.</note>

<pb n="223"/>
<p>Not that Cicero wishes that a poetical sentiment should have any weight in a question
like this; for when he says that the Stoics, when asserting the power of fate, were in the habit
of using these verses from Homer, he is not treating concerning the opinion of that poet,
but concerning that of those philosophers, since by these verses, which they quote in connection
with the controversy which they hold about fate, is most distinctly manifested what
it is which they reckon fate, since they call by the name of Jupiter him whom they reckon
the supreme god, from whom, they say, hangs the whole chain of fates.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Concerning the Foreknowledge of God and the Free Will of Man, in
Opposition to the Definition of Cicero.</head>
<p>The manner in which Cicero addresses himself to the task of refuting the Stoics, shows
that he did not think he could effect anything against them in argument unless he had first
demolished divination.194 And this he attempts to accomplish by denying that there is any
knowledge of future things, and maintains with all his might that there is no such knowledge
either in God or man, and that there is no prediction of events. Thus he both denies the
foreknowledge of God, and attempts by vain arguments, and by opposing to himself certain
oracles very easy to be refuted, to overthrow all prophecy, even such as is clearer than the
light (though even these oracles are not refuted by him).</p>
<p>But, in refuting these conjectures of the mathematicians, his argument is triumphant,
because truly these are such as destroy and refute themselves. Nevertheless, they are far
more tolerable who assert the fatal influence of the stars than they who deny the foreknowledge
of future events. For, to confess that God exists, and at the same time to deny that He
has foreknowledge of future things, is the most manifest folly. This Cicero himself saw, and
therefore attempted to assert the doctrine embodied in the words of Scripture, “The fool
hath said in his heart, There is no God.”195 That, however, he did not do in his own person,
for he saw how odious and offensive such an opinion would be; and therefore, in his book
on the nature of the gods,196 he makes Cotta dispute concerning this against the Stoics, and
preferred to give his own opinion in favor of Lucilius Balbus, to whom he assigned the defence
of the Stoical position, rather than in favor of Cotta, who maintained that no divinity exists.
However, in his book on divination, he in his own person most openly opposes the doctrine
of the prescience of future things. But all this he seems to do in order that he may not grant
the doctrine of fate, and by so doing destroy free will. For he thinks that, the knowledge of
future things being once conceded, fate follows as so necessary a consequence that it cannot
be denied.</p>
<p>But, let these perplexing debatings and disputations of the philosophers go on as they
may, we, in order that we may confess the most high and true God Himself, do confess His
will, supreme power, and prescience. Neither let us be afraid lest, after all, we do not do by
will that which we do by will, because He, whose foreknowledge is infallible, foreknew that
we would do it. It was this which Cicero was afraid of, and therefore opposed foreknowledge.
The Stoics also maintained that all things do not come to pass by necessity, although they
contended that all things happen according to destiny. What is it, then, that Cicero feared
in the prescience of future things? Doubtless it was this,—that if all future things have been
<note type="footnote">194 De Divinat.ii.</note>
<note type="footnote">195 Ps. xiv. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">196 Book iii.</note>

<pb n="225"/>
foreknown, they will happen in the order in which they have been foreknown; and if they
come to pass in this order, there is a certain order of things foreknown by God; and if a
certain order of things, then a certain order of causes, for nothing can happen which is not
preceded by some efficient cause. But if there is a certain order of causes according to which
everything happens which does happen, then by fate, says he, all things happen which do
happen. But if this be so, then is there nothing in our own power, and there is no such thing
as freedom of will; and if we grant that, says he, the whole economy of human life is subverted.
In vain are laws enacted. In vain are reproaches, praises, chidings, exhortations had
recourse to; and there is no justice whatever in the appointment of rewards for the good,
and punishments for the wicked. And that consequences so disgraceful, and absurd, and
pernicious to humanity may not follow, Cicero chooses to reject the foreknowledge of future
things, and shuts up the religious mind to this alternative, to make choice between two
things, either that something is in our own power, or that there is foreknowledge,—both of
which cannot be true; but if the one is affirmed, the other is thereby denied. He therefore,
like a truly great and wise man, and one who consulted very much and very skillfully for
the good of humanity, of those two chose the freedom of the will, to confirm which he denied
the foreknowledge of future things; and thus, wishing to make men free he makes them
sacrilegious. But the religious mind chooses both, confesses both, and maintains both by
the faith of piety. But how so? says Cicero; for the knowledge of future things being granted,
there follows a chain of consequences which ends in this, that there can be nothing depending
on our own free wills. And further, if there is anything depending on our wills, we must go
backwards by the same steps of reasoning till we arrive at the conclusion that there is no
foreknowledge of future things. For we go backwards through all the steps in the following
order:—If there is free will, all things do not happen according to fate; if all things do not
happen according to fate, there is not a certain order of causes; and if there is not a certain
order of causes, neither is there a certain order of things foreknown by God,—for things
cannot come to pass except they are preceded by efficient causes,—but, if there is no fixed
and certain order of causes foreknown by God, all things cannot be said to happen according
as He foreknew that they would happen. And further, if it is not true that all things happen
just as they have been foreknown by Him, there is not, says he, in God any foreknowledge
of future events.</p>
<p>Now, against the sacrilegious and impious darings of reason, we assert both that God
knows all things before they come to pass, and that we do by our free will whatsoever we
know and feel to be done by us only because we will it. But that all things come to pass by
fate, we do not say; nay we affirm that nothing comes to pass by fate; for we demonstrate
that the name of fate, as it is wont to be used by those who speak of fate, meaning thereby
the position of the stars at the time of each one’s conception or birth, is an unmeaning word,
for astrology itself is a delusion. But an order of causes in which the highest efficiency is

<pb n="226"/>
attributed to the will of God, we neither deny nor do we designate it by the name of fate,
unless, perhaps, we may understand fate to mean that which is spoken, deriving it from fari,
to speak; for we cannot deny that it is written in the sacred Scriptures, “God hath spoken
once; these two things have I heard, that power belongeth unto God. Also unto Thee, O
God, belongeth mercy: for Thou wilt render unto every man according to his works.”197
Now the expression, “Once hath He spoken,” is to be understood as meaning “immovably,”
that is, unchangeably hath He spoken, inasmuch as He knows unchangeably all things which
shall be, and all things which He will do. We might, then, use the word fate in the sense it
bears when derived from fari, to speak, had it not already come to be understood in another
sense, into which I am unwilling that the hearts of men should unconsciously slide. But it
does not follow that, though there is for God a certain order of all causes, there must therefore
be nothing depending on the free exercise of our own wills, for our wills themselves are included
in that order of causes which is certain to God, and is embraced by His foreknowledge,
for human wills are also causes of human actions; and He who foreknew all the causes of
things would certainly among those causes not have been ignorant of our wills. For even
that very concession which Cicero himself makes is enough to refute him in this argument.
For what does it help him to say that nothing takes place without a cause, but that every
cause is not fatal, there being a fortuitous cause, a natural cause, and a voluntary cause? It
is sufficient that he confesses that whatever happens must be preceded by a cause. For we
say that those causes which are called fortuitous are not a mere name for the absence of
causes, but are only latent, and we attribute them either to the will of the true God, or to
that of spirits of some kind or other. And as to natural causes, we by no means separate
them from the will of Him who is the author and framer of all nature. But now as to voluntary
causes. They are referable either to God, or to angels, or to men, or to animals of
whatever description, if indeed those instinctive movements of animals devoid of reason,
by which, in accordance with their own nature, they seek or shun various things, are to be
called wills. And when I speak of the wills of angels, I mean either the wills of good angels,
whom we call the angels of God, or of the wicked angels, whom we call the angels of the
devil, or demons. Also by the wills of men I mean the wills either of the good or of the
wicked. And from this we conclude that there are no efficient causes of all things which
come to pass unless voluntary causes, that is, such as belong to that nature which is the
spirit of life. For the air or wind is called spirit, but, inasmuch as it is a body, it is not the
spirit of life. The spirit of life, therefore, which quickens all things, and is the creator of
every body, and of every created spirit, is God Himself, the uncreated spirit. In His supreme
<note type="footnote">197 Ps. lxii. 11, 12.</note>

<pb n="227"/>
will resides the power which acts on the wills of all created spirits, helping the good, judging
the evil, controlling all, granting power to some, not granting it to others. For, as He is the
creator of all natures, so also is He the bestower of all powers, not of all wills; for wicked
wills are not from Him, being contrary to nature, which is from Him. As to bodies, they
are more subject to wills: some to our wills, by which I mean the wills of all living mortal
creatures, but more to the wills of men than of beasts. But all of them are most of all subject
to the will of God, to whom all wills also are subject, since they have no power except what
He has bestowed upon them. The cause of things, therefore, which makes but is not made,
is God; but all other causes both make and are made. Such are all created spirits, and especially
the rational. Material causes, therefore, which may rather be said to be made than to
make, are not to be reckoned among efficient causes, because they can only do what the
wills of spirits do by them. How, then, does an order of causes which is certain to the foreknowledge
of God necessitate that there should be nothing which is dependent on our wills,
when our wills themselves have a very important place in the order of causes? Cicero, then,
contends with those who call this order of causes fatal, or rather designate this order itself
by the name of fate; to which we have an abhorrence, especially on account of the word,
which men have become accustomed to understand as meaning what is not true. But,
whereas he denies that the order of all causes is most certain, and perfectly clear to the
prescience of God, we detest his opinion more than the Stoics do. For he either denies that
God exists,—which, indeed, in an assumed personage, he has labored to do, in his book De
Natura Deorum,—or if he confesses that He exists, but denies that He is prescient of future
things, what is that but just “the fool saying in his heart there is no God?” For one who is
not prescient of all future things is not God. Wherefore our wills also have just so much
power as God willed and foreknew that they should have; and therefore whatever power
they have, they have it within most certain limits; and whatever they are to do, they are most
assuredly to do, for He whose foreknowledge is infallible foreknew that they would have
the power to do it, and would do it. Wherefore, if I should choose to apply the name of fate
to anything at all, I should rather say that fate belongs to the weaker of two parties, will to
the stronger, who has the other in his power, than that the freedom of our will is excluded
by that order of causes, which, by an unusual application of the word peculiar to themselves,
the Stoics call Fate.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Whether Our Wills are Ruled by Necessity.</head>
<p>Wherefore, neither is that necessity to be feared, for dread of which the Stoics labored
to make such distinctions among the causes of things as should enable them to rescue certain
things from the dominion of necessity, and to subject others to it. Among those things
which they wished not to be subject to necessity they placed our wills, knowing that they
would not be free if subjected to necessity. For if that is to be called our necessity which is
not in our power, but even though we be unwilling effects what it can effect,—as, for instance,
the necessity of death,—it is manifest that our wills by which we live up-rightly or wickedly
are not under such a necessity; for we do many things which, if we were not willing, we
should certainly not do. This is primarily true of the act of willing itself,—for if we will, it
is; if we will not, it is not,—for we should not will if we were unwilling. But if we define
necessity to be that according to which we say that it is necessary that anything be of such
or such a nature, or be done in such and such a manner, I know not why we should have
any dread of that necessity taking away the freedom of our will. For we do not put the life
of God or the foreknowledge of God under necessity if we should say that it is necessary
that God should live forever, and foreknow all things; as neither is His power diminished
when we say that He cannot die or fall into error,—for this is in such a way impossible to
Him, that if it were possible for Him, He would be of less power. But assuredly He is rightly
called omnipotent, though He can neither die nor fall into error. For He is called omnipotent
on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not;
for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot
do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent. So also, when we say that it is
necessary that, when we will, we will by free choice, in so saying we both affirm what is true
beyond doubt, and do not still subject our wills thereby to a necessity which destroys liberty.
Our wills, therefore, exist as wills, and do themselves whatever we do by willing, and which
would not be done if we were unwilling. But when any one suffers anything, being unwilling
by the will of another, even in that case will retains its essential validity, —we do not mean
the will of the party who inflicts the suffering, for we resolve it into the power of God. For
if a will should simply exist, but not be able to do what it wills, it would be overborne by a
more powerful will. Nor would this be the case unless there had existed will, and that not
the will of the other party, but the will of him who willed, but was not able to accomplish
what he willed. Therefore, whatsoever a man suffers contrary to his own will, he ought not
to attribute to the will of men, or of angels, or of any created spirit, but rather to His will
who gives power to wills. It is not the case, therefore, that because God foreknew what
would be in the power of our wills, there is for that reason nothing in the power of our wills.
For he who foreknew this did not foreknow nothing. Moreover, if He who foreknew what
would be in the power of our wills did not foreknow nothing, but something, assuredly,
even though He did foreknow, there is something in the power of our wills. Therefore we

<pb n="229"/>
are by no means compelled, either, retaining the prescience of God, to take away the freedom
of the will, or, retaining the freedom of the will, to deny that He is prescient of future things,
which is impious. But we embrace both. We faithfully and sincerely confess both. The
former, that we may believe well; the latter, that we may live well. For he lives ill who does
not believe well concerning God. Wherefore, be it far from us, in order to maintain our
freedom, to deny the prescience of Him by whose help we are or shall be free. Consequently,
it is not in vain that laws are enacted, and that reproaches, exhortations, praises, and vituperations
are had recourse to; for these also He foreknew, and they are of great avail, even
as great as He foreknew that they would be of. Prayers, also, are of avail to procure those
things which He foreknew that He would grant to those who offered them; and with justice
have rewards been appointed for good deeds, and punishments for sins. For a man does
not therefore sin because God foreknew that he would sin. Nay, it cannot be doubted but
that it is the man himself who sins when he does sin, because He, whose foreknowledge is
infallible, foreknew not that fate, or fortune, or something else would sin, but that the man
himself would sin, who, if he wills not, sins not. But if he shall not will to sin, even this did
God foreknow.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—By What Virtues the Ancient Romans Merited that the True God,
Although They Did Not Worship Him, Should Enlarge Their Empire.</head>
<p>Wherefore let us go on to consider what virtues of the Romans they were which the true
God, in whose power are also the kingdoms of the earth, condescended to help in order to
raise the empire, and also for what reason He did so. And, in order to discuss this question
on clearer ground, we have written the former books, to show that the power of those gods,
who, they thought, were to be worshipped with such trifling and silly rites, had nothing to
do in this matter; and also what we have already accomplished of the present volume, to
refute the doctrine of fate, lest any one who might have been already persuaded that the
Roman empire was not extended and preserved by the worship of these gods, might still be
attributing its extension and preservation to some kind of fate, rather than to the most
powerful will of God most high. The ancient and primitive Ro mans, therefore, though
their history shows us that, like all the other nations, with the sole exception of the Hebrews,
they worshipped false gods, and sacrificed victims, not to God, but to demons, have nevertheless
this commendation bestowed on them by their historian, that they were “greedy of
praise, prodigal of wealth, desirous of great glory, and content with a moderate fortune.”198
Glory they most ardently loved: for it they wished to live, for it they did not hesitate to die.
Every other desire was repressed by the strength of their passion for that one thing. At
length their country itself, because it seemed inglorious to serve, but glorious to rule and to
command, they first earnestly desired to be free, and then to be mistress. Hence it was that,
not enduring the domination of kings, they put the government into the hands of two chiefs,
holding office for a year, who were called consuls, not kings or lords.199 But royal pomp
seemed inconsistent with the administration of a ruler (regentis), or the benevolence of one
who consults (that is, for the public good) (consulentis), but rather with the haughtiness of
a lord (dominantis). King Tarquin, therefore, having been banished, and the consular government
having been instituted, it followed, as the same author already alluded to says in
his praises of the Romans, that “the state grew with amazing rapidity after it had obtained
liberty, so great a desire of glory had taken possession of it.” That eagerness for praise and
desire of glory, then, was that which accomplished those many wonderful things, laudable,
doubtless, and glorious according to human judgment. The same Sallust praises the great
men of his own time, Marcus Cato, and Caius Cæsar, saying that for a long time the republic
had no one great in virtue, but that within his memory there had been these two men of
eminent virtue, and very different pursuits. Now, among the praises which he pronounces
on Cæsar he put this, that he wished for a great empire, an army, and a new war, that he
<note type="footnote">198 Sallust, Cat. vii.</note>
<note type="footnote">199 Augustin notes that the name consul is derived from consulere, and thus signifies a more benign rule than
that of a rex (from regere), or dominus (from dominari).</note>

<pb n="232"/>
might have a sphere where his genius and virtue might shine forth. Thus it was ever the
prayer of men of heroic character that Bellona would excite miserable nations to war, and
lash them into agitation with her bloody scourge, so that there might be occasion for the
display of their valor. This, forsooth, is what that desire of praise and thirst for glory did.
Wherefore, by the love of liberty in the first place, afterwards also by that of domination
and through the desire of praise and glory, they achieved many great things; and their most
eminent poet testifies to their having been prompted by all these motives:
<lg>
<l>“Porsenna there, with pride elate,</l>
<l>Bids Rome to Tarquin ope her gate;</l>
<l>With arms he hems the city in,</l>
<l>Æneas’ sons stand firm to win.”200</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>At that time it was their greatest ambition either to die bravely or to live free; but when
liberty was obtained, so great a desire of glory took possession of them, that liberty alone
was not enough unless domination also should be sought, their great ambition being that
which the same poet puts into the mouth of Jupiter:
<lg>
<l>“Nay, Juno’s self, whose wild alarms</l>
<l>Set ocean, earth, and heaven in arms,</l>
<l>Shall change for smiles her moody frown,</l>
<l>And vie with me in zeal to crown</l>
<l>Rome’s sons, the nation of the gown.</l>
<l>So stands my will. There comes a day,</l>
<l>While Rome’s great ages hold their way,</l>
<l>When old Assaracus’s sons</l>
<l>Shall quit them on the myrmidons,</l>
<l>O’er Phthia and Mycenæ reign,</l>
<l>And humble Argos to their chain.”201</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Which things, indeed, Virgil makes Jupiter predict as future, whilst, in reality, he was
only himself passing in review in his own mind, things which were already done, and which
were beheld by him as present realities. But I have mentioned them with the intention of
showing that, next to liberty, the Romans so highly esteemed domination, that it received
a place among those things on which they bestowed the greatest praise. Hence also it is that
that poet, preferring to the arts of other nations those arts which peculiarly belong to the
Romans, namely, the arts of ruling and commanding, and of subjugating and vanquishing
nations, says,
<note type="footnote">200 Æneid, viii. 646.</note>
<note type="footnote">201 Ibid. i. 279.</note>

<pb n="233"/>
<lg>
<l>“Others, belike, with happier grace,</l>
<l>From bronze or stone shall call the face,</l>
<l>Plead doubtful causes, map the skies,</l>
<l>And tell when planets set or rise;</l>
<l>But Roman thou, do thou control</l>
<l>The nations far and wide;</l>
<l>Be this thy genius, to impose</l>
<l>The rule of peace on vanquished foes,</l>
<l>Show pity to the humble soul,</l>
<l>And crush the sons of pride.”202</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>These arts they exercised with the more skill the less they gave themselves up to pleasures,
and to enervation of body and mind in coveting and amassing riches, and through these
corrupting morals, by extorting them from the miserable citizens and lavishing them on
base stage-players. Hence these men of base character, who abounded when Sallust wrote
and Virgil sang these things, did not seek after honors and glory by these arts, but by
treachery and deceit. Wherefore the same says, “But at first it was rather ambition than
avarice that stirred the minds of men, which vice, however, is nearer to virtue. For glory,
honor, and power are desired alike by the good man and by the ignoble; but the former,”
he says, “strives onward to them by the true way, whilst the other, knowing nothing of the
good arts, seeks them by fraud and deceit.”203 And what is meant by seeking the attainment
of glory, honor, and power by good arts, is to seek them by virtue, and not by deceitful intrigue;
for the good and the ignoble man alike desire these things, but the good man strives
to overtake them by the true way. The way is virtue, along which he presses as to the goal
of possession—namely, to glory, honor, and power. Now that this was a sentiment engrained
in the Roman mind, is indicated even by the temples of their gods; for they built in very
close proximity the temples of Virtue and Honor, worshipping as gods the gifts of God.
Hence we can understand what they who were good thought to be the end of virtue, and to
what they ultimately referred it, namely, to honor; for, as to the bad, they had no virtue
though they desired honor, and strove to possess it by fraud and deceit. Praise of a higher
kind is bestowed upon Cato, for he says of him “The less he sought glory, the more it followed
him.”204 We say praise of a higher kind; for the glory with the desire of which the Romans
burned is the judgment of men thinking well of men. And therefore virtue is better, which
is content with no human judgment save that of one’s own conscience. Whence the apostle
says, “For this is our glory, the testimony of our conscience.”205 And in another place he
<note type="footnote">202 Ibid. vi. 847.</note>
<note type="footnote">203 Sallust, in Cat. c. xi.</note>
<note type="footnote">204 Sallust, in Cat. c. 54.</note>
<note type="footnote">205 2 Cor. i. 12.</note>

<pb n="234"/>
says, “But let every one prove his own work, and then he shall have glory in himself, and
not in another.”206 That glory, honor, and power, therefore, which they desired for themselves,
and to which the good sought to attain by good arts, should not be sought after by
virtue, but virtue by them. For there is no true virtue except that which is directed towards
that end in which is the highest and ultimate good of man. Wherefore even the honors
which Cato sought he ought not to have sought, but the state ought to have conferred them
on him unsolicited, on account of his virtues.</p>
<p>But, of the two great Romans of that time, Cato was he whose virtue was by far the
nearest to the true idea of virtue. Wherefore, let us refer to the opinion of Cato himself, to
discover what was the judgment he had formed concerning the condition of the state both
then and in former times. “I do not think,” he says, “that it was by arms that our ancestors
made the republic great from being small. Had that been the case, the republic of our day
would have been by far more flourishing than that of their times, for the number of our allies
and citizens is far greater; and, besides, we possess a far greater abundance of armor and of
horses than they did. But it was other things than these that made them great, and we have
none of them: industry at home, just government without, a mind free in deliberation, addicted
neither to crime nor to lust. Instead of these, we have luxury and avarice, poverty in
the state, opulence among citizens; we laud riches, we follow laziness; there is no difference
made between the good and the bad; all the rewards of virtue are got possession of by intrigue.
And no wonder, when every individual consults only for his own good, when ye are
the slaves of pleasure at home, and, in public affairs, of money and favor, no wonder that
an onslaught is made upon the unprotected republic.”207</p>
<p>He who hears these words of Cato or of Sallust probably thinks that such praise bestowed
on the ancient Romans was applicable to all of them, or, at least, to very many of them. It
is not so; otherwise the things which Cato himself writes, and which I have quoted in the
second book of this work, would not be true. In that passage he says, that even from the
very beginning of the state wrongs were committed by the more powerful, which led to the
separation of the people from the fathers, besides which there were other internal dissensions;
and the only time at which there existed a just and moderate administration was after the
banishment of the kings, and that no longer than whilst they had cause to be afraid of Tarquin,
and were carrying on the grievous war which had been undertaken on his account
against Etruria; but afterwards the fathers oppressed the people as slaves, flogged them as
the kings had done, drove them from their land, and, to the exclusion of all others, held the
government in their own hands alone. And to these discords, whilst the fathers were wishing
to rule, and the people were unwilling to serve, the second Punic war put an end; for again
<note type="footnote">206 Gal. vi. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">207 Sallust, in Cat. c. 52.</note>

<pb n="235"/>
great fear began to press upon their disquieted minds, holding them back from those dis-
tractions by another and greater anxiety, and bringing them back to civil concord. But the
great things which were then achieved were accomplished through the administration of a
few men, who were good in their own way. And by the wisdom and forethought of these
few good men, which first enabled the republic to endure these evils and mitigated them, it
waxed greater and greater. And this the same historian affirms, when he says that, reading
and hearing of the many illustrious achievements of the Roman people in peace and in war,
by land and by sea, he wished to understand what it was by which these great things were
specially sustained. For he knew that very often the Romans had with a small company
contended with great legions of the enemy; and he knew also that with small resources they
had carried on wars with opulent kings. And he says that, after having given the matter
much consideration, it seemed evident to him that the pre-eminent virtue of a few citizens
had achieved the whole, and that that explained how poverty overcame wealth, and small
numbers great multitudes. But, he adds, after that the state had been corrupted by luxury
and indolence, again the republic, by its own greatness, was able to bear the vices of its magistrates
and generals. Wherefore even the praises of Cato are only applicable to a few; for
only a few were possessed of that virtue which leads men to pursue after glory, honor, and
power by the true way,—that is, by virtue itself. This industry at home, of which Cato speaks,
was the consequence of a desire to enrich the public treasury, even though the result should
be poverty at home; and therefore, when he speaks of the evil arising out of the corruption
of morals, he reverses the expression, and says, “Poverty in the state, riches at home.”</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Concerning the Love of Praise, Which, Though It is a Vice, is Reckoned
a Virtue, Because by It Greater Vice is Restrained.</head>
<p>Wherefore, when the kingdoms of the East had been illustrious for a long time, it pleased
God that there should also arise a Western empire, which, though later in time, should be
more illustrious in extent and greatness. And, in order that it might overcome the grievous
evils which existed among other nations, He purposely granted it to such men as, for the
sake of honor, and praise, and glory, consulted well for their country, in whose glory they
sought their own, and whose safety they did not hesitate to prefer to their own, suppressing
the desire of wealth and many other vices for this one vice, namely, the love of praise. For
he has the soundest perception who recognizes that even the love of praise is a vice; nor has
this escaped the perception of the poet Horace, who says,
<lg>
<l>“You’re bloated by ambition? take advice:</l>
<l>Yon book will ease you if you read it thrice.”208</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And the same poet, in a lyric song, hath thus spoken with the desire of repressing the
passion for domination:
<lg>
<l>“Rule an ambitious spirit, and thou hast</l>
<l>A wider kingdom than if thou shouldst join</l>
<l>To distant Gades Lybia, and thus</l>
<l>Shouldst hold in service either Carthaginian.”209</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they who restrain baser lusts, not by the power of the Holy Spirit obtained
by the faith of piety, or by the love of intelligible beauty, but by desire of human praise, or,
at all events, restrain them better by the love of such praise, are not indeed yet holy, but only
less base. Even Tully was not able to conceal this fact; for, in the same books which he wrote,
De Republica, when speaking concerning the education of a chief of the state, who ought,
he says, to be nourished on glory, goes on to say that their ancestors did many wonderful
and illustrious things through desire of glory. So far, therefore, from resisting this vice, they
even thought that it ought to be excited and kindled up, supposing that that would be beneficial
to the republic. But not even in his books on philosophy does Tully dissimulate this
poisonous opinion, for he there avows it more clearly than day. For when he is speaking of
those studies which are to be pursued with a view to the true good, and not with the vainglorious
desire of human praise, he introduces the following universal and general statement:

<head>Chapter 14.—Concerning the Eradication of the Love of Human Praise, Because All
the Glory of the Righteous is in God.</head>
<p>It is, therefore, doubtless far better to resist this desire than to yield to it, for the purer
one is from this defilement, the liker is he to God; and, though this vice be not thoroughly
eradicated from his heart,—for it does not cease to tempt even the minds of those who are
making good progress in virtue,—at any rate, let the desire of glory be surpassed by the love
of righteousness, so that, if there be seen anywhere “lying neglected things which are generally
discredited,” if they are good, if they are right, even the love of human praise may blush
and yield to the love of truth. For so hostile is this vice to pious faith, if the love of glory be
greater in the heart than the fear or love of God, that the Lord said, “How can ye believe,
who look for glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from God alone?”211
Also, concerning some who had believed on Him, but were afraid to confess Him openly,
the evangelist says, “They loved the praise of men more than the praise of God;”212 which
did not the holy apostles, who, when they proclaimed the name of Christ in those places
where it was not only discredited, and therefore neglected,—according as Cicero says, “Those
things are always neglected which are generally discredited,”—but was even held in the utmost
detestation, holding to what they had heard from the Good Master, who was also the physician
of minds, “If any one shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father
who is in heaven, and before the angels of God,”213 amidst maledictions and reproaches,
and most grievous persecutions and cruel punishments, were not deterred from the
preaching of human salvation by the noise of human indignation. And when, as they did
and spake divine things, and lived divine lives, conquering, as it were, hard hearts, and introducing
into them the peace of righteousness, great glory followed them in the church of
Christ, they did not rest in that as in the end of their virtue, but, referring that glory itself
to the glory of God, by whose grace they were what they were, they sought to kindle, also
by that same flame, the minds of those for whose good they consulted, to the love of Him,
by whom they could be made to be what they themselves were. For their Master had taught
them not to seek to be good for the sake of human glory, saying, “Take heed that ye do not
your righteousness before men to be seen of them, or otherwise ye shall not have a reward
from your Father who is in heaven.”214 But again, lest, understanding this wrongly, they
should, through fear of pleasing men, be less useful through concealing their goodness,
showing for what end they ought to make it known, He says, “Let your works shine before

men, that they may see your good deeds, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”215 Not,
observe, “that ye may be seen by them, that is, in order that their eyes may be directed upon
you,”—for of yourselves ye are, nothing,—but “that they may glorify your Father who is in
heaven,” by fixing their regards on whom they may become such as ye are. These the martyrs
followed, who surpassed the Scævolas, and the Curtiuses, and the Deciuses, both in true
virtue, because in true piety, and also in the greatness of their number. But since those Romans
were in an earthly city, and had before them, as the end of all the offices undertaken
in its behalf, its safety, and a kingdom, not in heaven, but in earth,—not in the sphere of
eternal life, but in the sphere of demise and succession, where the dead are succeeded by
the dying,—what else but glory should they love, by which they wished even after death to
live in the mouths of their admirers?</p>

<p>Now, therefore, with regard to those to whom God did not purpose to give eternal life
with His holy angels in His own celestial city, to the society of which that true piety which
does not render the service of religion, which the Greeks call λατρεία, to any save the true
God conducts, if He had also withheld from them the terrestrial glory of that most excellent
empire, a reward would not have been rendered to their good arts,—that is, their virtues,—by
which they sought to attain so great glory. For as to those who seem to do some good that
they may receive glory from men, the Lord also says, “Verily I say unto you, they have received
their reward.”216 So also these despised their own private affairs for the sake of the
republic, and for its treasury resisted avarice, consulted for the good of their country with
a spirit of freedom, addicted neither to what their laws pronounced to be crime nor to lust.
By all these acts, as by the true way, they pressed forward to honors, power, and glory; they
were honored among almost all nations; they imposed the laws of their empire upon many
nations; and at this day, both in literature and history, they are glorious among almost all
nations. There is no reason why they should complain against the justice of the supreme
and true God,—“they have received their reward.”</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Concerning the Reward of the Holy Citizens of the Celestial City, to
Whom the Example of the Virtues of the Romans are Useful.</head>
<p>But the reward of the saints is far different, who even here endured reproaches for that
city of God which is hateful to the lovers of this world. That city is eternal. There none are
born, for none die. There is true and full felicity,—not a goddess, but a gift of God. Thence
we receive the pledge of faith whilst on our pilgrimage we sigh for its beauty. There rises
not the sun on the good and the evil, but the Sun of Righteousness protects the good alone.
There no great industry shall be expended to enrich the public treasury by suffering privations
at home, for there is the common treasury of truth. And, therefore, it was not only for the
sake of recompensing the citizens of Rome that her empire and glory had been so signally
extended, but also that the citizens of that eternal city, during their pilgrimage here, might
diligently and soberly contemplate these examples, and see what a love they owe to the supernal
country on account of life eternal, if the terrestrial country was so much beloved by
its citizens on account of human glory.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—To What Profit the Romans Carried on Wars, and How Much They
Contributed to the Well-Being of Those Whom They Conquered.</head>
<p>For, as far as this life of mortals is concerned, which is spent and ended in a few days,
what does it matter under whose government a dying man lives, if they who govern do not
force him to impiety and iniquity? Did the Romans at all harm those nations, on whom,
when subjugated, they imposed their laws, except in as far as that was accomplished with
great slaughter in war? Now, had it been done with consent of the nations, it would have
been done with greater success, but there would have been no glory of conquest, for neither
did the Romans themselves live exempt from those laws which they imposed on others.
Had this been done without Mars and Bellona, so that there should have been no place for
victory, no one conquering where no one had fought, would not the condition of the Romans
and of the other nations have been one and the same, especially if that had been done at
once which afterwards was done most humanely and most acceptably, namely, the admission
of all to the rights of Roman citizens who belonged to the Roman empire, and if that had
been made the privilege of all which was formerly the privilege of a few, with this one condition,
that the humbler class who had no lands of their own should live at the public expense—
an alimentary impost, which would have been paid with a much better grace by
them into the hands of good administrators of the republic, of which they were members,
by their own hearty consent, than it would have been paid with had it to be extorted from
them as conquered men? For I do not see what it makes for the safety, good morals, and
certainly not for the dignity, of men, that some have conquered and others have been
conquered, except that it yields them that most insane pomp of human glory, in which “they
have received their reward,” who burned with excessive desire of it, and carried on most
eager wars. For do not their lands pay tribute? Have they any privilege of learning what
the others are not privileged to learn? Are there not many senators in the other countries
who do not even know Rome by sight? Take away outward show,217 and what are all men
after all but men? But even though the perversity of the age should permit that all the better
men should be more highly honored than others, neither thus should human honor be held
at a great price, for it is smoke which has no weight. But let us avail ourselves even in these
things of the kindness of God. Let us consider how great things they despised, how great
things they endured, what lusts they subdued for the sake of human glory, who merited that
glory, as it were, in reward for such virtues; and let this be useful to us even in suppressing
pride, so that, as that city in which it has been promised us to reign as far surpasses this one
as heaven is distant from the earth, as eternal life surpasses temporal joy, solid glory empty
praise, or the society of angels the society of mortals, or the glory of Him who made the sun
and moon the light of the sun and moon, the citizens of so great a country may not seem

<pb n="243"/>
to themselves to have done anything very great, if, in order to obtain it, they have done some
good works or endured some evils, when those men for this terrestrial country already obtained,
did such great things, suffered such great things. And especially are all these things
to be considered, because the remission of sins which collects citizens to the celestial country
has something in it to which a shadowy resemblance is found in that asylum of Romulus,
whither escape from the punishment of all manner of crimes congregated that multitude
with which the state was to be founded.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—How Far Christians Ought to Be from Boasting, If They Have Done
Anything for the Love of the Eternal Country, When the Romans Did Such Great
Things for Human Glory and a Terrestrial City.</head>
<p>What great thing, therefore, is it for that eternal and celestial city to despise all the
charms of this world, however pleasant, if for the sake of this terrestrial city Brutus could
even put to death his son,—a sacrifice which the heavenly city compels no one to make?
But certainly it is more difficult to put to death one’s sons, than to do what is required to
be done for the heavenly country, even to distribute to the poor those things which were
looked upon as things to be massed and laid up for one’s children, or to let them go, if there
arise any temptation which compels us to do so, for the sake of faith and righteousness. For
it is not earthly riches which make us or our sons happy; for they must either be lost by us
in our lifetime, or be possessed when we are dead, by whom we know not, or perhaps by
whom we would not. But it is God who makes us happy, who is the true riches of minds.
But of Brutus, even the poet who celebrates his praises testifies that it was the occasion of
unhappiness to him that he slew his son, for he says,
<lg>
<l>“And call his own rebellious seed</l>
<l>For menaced liberty to bleed.</l>
<l>Unhappy father! howsoe’er</l>
<l>The deed be judged by after days.”218</l>
<l>But in the following verse he consoles him in his unhappiness, saying,</l>
<l>“His country’s love shall all o’erbear.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>There are those two things, namely, liberty and the desire of human praise, which
compelled the Romans to admirable deeds. If, therefore, for the liberty of dying men, and
for the desire of human praise which is sought after by mortals, sons could be put to death
by a father, what great thing is it, if, for the true liberty which has made us free from the
dominion of sin, and death, and the devil,—not through the desire of human praise, but
through the earnest desire of fleeing men, not from King Tarquin, but from demons and
the prince of the demons,—we should, I do not say put to death our sons, but reckon among
our sons Christ’s poor ones? If, also, another Roman chief, surnamed Torquatus, slew his
son, not because he fought against his country, but because, being challenged by an enemy,
he through youthful impetuosity fought, though for his country, yet contrary to orders
which he his father had given as general; and this he did, notwithstanding that his son was
victorious, lest there should be more evil in the example of authority despised, than good
in the glory of slaying an enemy;—if, I say, Torquatus acted thus, wherefore should they
<note type="footnote">218 Æneid, vi. 820.</note>

<pb n="245"/>
boast themselves, who, for the laws of a celestial country, despise all earthly good things,
which are loved far less than sons? If Furius Camillus, who was condemned by those who
envied him, notwithstanding that he had thrown off from the necks of his countrymen the
yoke of their most bitter enemies, the Veientes, again delivered his ungrateful country from
the Gauls, because he had no other in which he could have better opportunities for living a
life of glory;—if Camillus did thus, why should he be extolled as having done some great
thing, who, having, it may be, suffered in the church at the hands of carnal enemies most
grievous and dishonoring injury, has not betaken himself to heretical enemies, or himself
raised some heresy against her, but has rather defended her, as far as he was able, from the
most pernicious perversity of heretics, since there is not another church, I say not in which
one can live a life of glory, but in which eternal life can be obtained? If Mucius, in order
that peace might be made with King Porsenna, who was pressing the Romans with a most
grievous war, when he did not succeed in slaying Porsenna, but slew another by mistake for
him, reached forth his right hand and laid it on a red-hot altar, saying that many such as he
saw him to be had conspired for his destruction, so that Porsenna, terrified at his daring,
and at the thought of a conspiracy of such as he, without any delay recalled all his warlike
purposes, and made peace;—if, I say, Mucius did this, who shall speak of his meritorious
claims to the kingdom of heaven, if for it he may have given to the flames not one hand, but
even his whole body, and that not by his own spontaneous act, but because he was persecuted
by another? If Curtius, spurring on his steed, threw himself all armed into a precipitous
gulf, obeying the oracles of their gods, which had commanded that the Romans should
throw into that gulf the best thing which they possessed, and they could only understand
thereby that, since they excelled in men and arms, the gods had commanded that an armed
man should be cast headlong into that destruction;—if he did this, shall we say that that
man has done a great thing for the eternal city who may have died by a like death, not,
however, precipitating himself spontaneously into a gulf, but having suffered this death at
the hands of some enemy of his faith, more especially when he has received from his Lord,
who is also King of his country, a more certain oracle, “Fear not them who kill the body,
but cannot kill the soul?”219 If the Decii dedicated themselves to death, consecrating
themselves in a form of words, as it were, that falling, and pacifying by their blood the wrath
of the gods, they might be the means of delivering the Roman army;—if they did this, let
not the holy martyrs carry themselves proudly, as though they had done some meritorious
thing for a share in that country where are eternal life and felicity, if even to the shedding
of their blood, loving not only the brethren for whom it was shed, but, according as had
been commanded them, even their enemies by whom it was being shed, they have vied with
one another in faith of love and love of faith. If Marcus Pulvillus, when engaged in dedicating
<note type="footnote">219 Matt. x. 28.</note>

<pb n="246"/>
a temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, received with such indifference the false intelligence
which was brought to him of the death of his son, with the intention of so agitating him that
he should go away, and thus the glory of dedicating the temple should fall to his colleague;—if
he received that intelligence with such indifference that he even ordered that his son should
be cast out unburied, the love of glory having overcome in his heart the grief of bereavement,
how shall any one affirm that he had done a great thing for the preaching of the gospel, by
which the citizens of the heavenly city are delivered from divers errors and gathered together
from divers wanderings, to whom his Lord has said, when anxious about the burial of his
father, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead?”220 Regulus, in order not to break his
oath, even with his most cruel enemies, returned to them from Rome itself, because (as he
is said to have replied to the Romans when they wished to retain him) he could not have
the dignity of an honorable citizen at Rome after having been a slave to the Africans, and
the Carthaginians put him to death with the utmost tortures, because he had spoken against
them in the senate. If Regulus acted thus, what tortures are not to be despised for the sake
of good faith toward that country to whose beatitude faith itself leads? Or what will a man
have rendered to the Lord for all He has bestowed upon him, if, for the faithfulness he owes
to Him, he shall have suffered such things as Regulus suffered at the hands of his most
ruthless enemies for the good faith which he owed to them? And how shall a Christian dare
vaunt himself of his voluntary poverty, which he has chosen in order that during the pilgrimage
of this life he may walk the more disencumbered on the way which leads to the country
where the true riches are, even God Himself;—how, I say, shall he vaunt himself for this,
when he hears or reads that Lucius Valerius, who died when he was holding the office of
consul, was so poor that his funeral expenses were paid with money collected by the
people?—or when he hears that Quintius Cincinnatus, who, possessing only four acres of
land, and cultivating them with his own hands, was taken from the plough to be made dictator,—
an office more honorable even than that of consul,—and that, after having won great
glory by conquering the enemy, he preferred notwithstanding to continue in his poverty?
Or how shall he boast of having done a great thing, who has not been prevailed upon by the
offer of any reward of this world to renounce his connection with that heavenly and eternal
country, when he hears that Fabricius could not be prevailed on to forsake the Roman city
by the great gifts offered to him by Pyrrhus king of the Epirots, who promised him the fourth
part of his kingdom, but preferred to abide there in his poverty as a private individual? For
if, when their republic,—that is, the interest of the people, the interest of the country, the
common interest,—was most prosperous and wealthy, they themselves were so poor in their
own houses, that one of them, who had already been twice a consul, was expelled from that
senate of poor men by the censor, because he was discovered to possess ten pounds weight
<note type="footnote">220 Matt. viii. 22.</note>

<pb n="247"/>
of silverplate,—since, I say, those very men by whose triumphs the public treasury was enriched
were so poor, ought not all Christians, who make common property of their riches
with a far nobler purpose, even that (according to what is written in the Acts of the Apostles)
they may distribute to each one according to his need, and that no one may say that anything
is his own, but that all things may be their common possession,221—ought they not to understand
that they should not vaunt themselves, because they do that to obtain the society
of angels, when those men did well-nigh the same thing to preserve the glory of the Romans?</p>
<p>How could these, and whatever like things are found in the Roman history, have become
so widely known, and have been proclaimed by so great a fame, had not the Roman empire,
extending far and wide, been raised to its greatness by magnificent successes? Wherefore,
through that empire, so extensive and of so long continuance, so illustrious and glorious
also through the virtues of such great men, the reward which they sought was rendered to
their earnest aspirations, and also examples are set before us, containing necessary admon-
ition, in order that we may be stung with shame if we shall see that we have not held fast
those virtues for the sake of the most glorious city of God, which are, in whatever way, resembled
by those virtues which they held fast for the sake of the glory of a terrestrial city,
and that, too, if we shall feel conscious that we have held them fast, we may not be lifted up
with pride, because, as the apostle says, “The sufferings of the present time are not worthy
to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us.”222 But so far as regards human
and temporal glory, the lives of these ancient Romans were reckoned sufficiently worthy.
Therefore, also, we see, in the light of that truth which, veiled in the Old Testament, is revealed
in the New, namely, that it is not in view of terrestrial and temporal benefits, which
divine providence grants promiscuously to good and evil, that God is to be worshipped, but
in view of eternal life, everlasting gifts, and of the society of the heavenly city itself;—in the
light of this truth we see that the Jews were most righteously given as a trophy to the glory
of the Romans; for we see that these Romans, who rested on earthly glory, and sought to
obtain it by virtues, such as they were, conquered those who, in their great depravity, slew
and rejected the giver of true glory, and of the eternal city.</p>

<pb n="248"/>
<head>Chapter 19.—Concerning the Difference Between True Glory and the Desire of
Domination.</head>
<p>There is assuredly a difference between the desire of human glory and the desire of
domination; for, though he who has an overweening delight in human glory will be also
very prone to aspire earnestly after domination, nevertheless they who desire the true glory
even of human praise strive not to displease those who judge well of them. For there are
many good moral qualities, of which many are competent judges, although they are not
possessed by many; and by those good moral qualities those men press on to glory, honor
and domination, of whom Sallust says, “But they press on by the true way.”</p>
<p>But whosoever, without possessing that desire of glory which makes one fear to displease
those who judge his conduct, desires domination and power, very often seeks to obtain what
he loves by most open crimes. Therefore he who desires glory presses on to obtain it either
by the true way, or certainly by deceit and artifice, wishing to appear good when he is not.
Therefore to him who possesses virtues it is a great virtue to despise glory; for contempt of
it is seen by God, but is not manifest to human judgment. For whatever any one does before
the eyes of men in order to show himself to be a despiser of glory, if they suspect that he is
doing it in order to get greater praise,—that is, greater glory,—he has no means of demonstrating
to the perceptions of those who suspect him that the case is really otherwise than
they suspect it to be. But he who despises the judgment of praisers, despises also the rashness
of suspectors. Their salvation, indeed, he does not despise, if he is truly good; for so great
is the righteousness of that man who receives his virtues from the Spirit of God, that he
loves his very enemies, and so loves them that he desires that his haters and detractors may
be turned to righteousness, and become his associates, and that not in an earthly but in a
heavenly country. But with respect to his praisers, though he sets little value on their praise,
he does not set little value on their love; neither does he elude their praise, lest he should
forfeit their love. And, therefore, he strives earnestly to have their praises directed to Him
from whom every one receives whatever in him is truly praiseworthy. But he who is a despiser
of glory, but is greedy of domination, exceeds the beasts in the vices of cruelty and luxuriousness.
Such, indeed, were certain of the Romans, who, wanting the love of esteem, wanted
not the thirst for domination; and that there were many such, history testifies. But it was
Nero Cæsar who was the first to reach the summit, and, as it were, the citadel, of this vice;
for so great was his luxuriousness, that one would have thought there was nothing manly
to be dreaded in him, and such his cruelty, that, had not the contrary been known, no one
would have thought there was anything effeminate in his character. Nevertheless power
and domination are not given even to such men save by the providence of the most high
God, when He judges that the state of human affairs is worthy of such lords. The divine
utterance is clear on this matter; for the Wisdom of God thus speaks: “By me kings reign,

<pb n="249"/>
and tyrants possess the land.”223 But, that it may not be thought that by “tyrants” is meant,
not wicked and impious kings, but brave men, in accordance with the ancient use of the
word, as when Virgil says,
<lg>
<l>“For know that treaty may not stand</l>
<l>Where king greets king and joins not hand,”224</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>in another place it is most unambiguously said of God, that He “maketh the man who
is an hypocrite to reign on account of the perver sity of the people.”225 Wherefore, though
I have, according to my ability, shown for what reason God, who alone is true and just,
helped forward the Romans, who were good according to a certain standard of an earthly
state, to the acquirement of the glory of so great an empire, there may be, nevertheless, a
more hidden cause, known better to God than to us, depending on the diversity of the
merits of the human race. Among all who are truly pious, it is at all events agreed that no
one without true piety,—that is, true worship of the true God—can have true virtue; and
that it is not true virtue which is the slave of human praise. Though, nevertheless, they who
are not citizens of the eternal city, which is called the city of God in the sacred Scriptures,
are more useful to the earthly city when they possess even that virtue than if they had not
even that. But there could be nothing more fortunate for human affairs than that, by the
mercy of God, they who are endowed with true piety of life, if they have the skill for ruling
people, should also have the power. But such men, however great virtues they may possess
in this life, attribute it solely to the grace of God that He has bestowed it on them—willing,
believing, seeking. And, at the same time, they understand how far they are short of that
perfection of righteousness which exists in the society of those holy angels for which they
are striving to fit themselves. But however much that virtue may be praised and cried up,
which without true piety is the slave of human glory, it is not at all to be compared even to
the feeble beginnings of the virtue of the saints, whose hope is placed in the grace and mercy
of the true God.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—That It is as Shameful for the Virtues to Serve Human Glory as Bodily
Pleasure.</head>
<p>Philosophers,—who place the end of human good in virtue itself, in order to put to
shame certain other philosophers, who indeed approve of the virtues, but measure them all
with reference to the end of bodily pleasure, and think that this pleasure is to be sought for
its own sake, but the virtues on account of pleasure,—are wont to paint a kind of wordpicture,
in which Pleasure sits like a luxurious queen on a royal seat, and all the virtues are
subjected to her as slaves, watching her nod, that they may do whatever she shall command.
She commands Prudence to be ever on the watch to discover how Pleasure may rule, and
be safe. Justice she orders to grant what benefits she can, in order to secure those friendships
which are necessary for bodily pleasure; to do wrong to no one, lest, on account of the
breaking of the laws, Pleasure be not able to live in security. Fortitude she orders to keep
her mistress, that is, Pleasure, bravely in her mind, if any affliction befall her body which
does not occasion death, in order that by remembrance of former delights she may mitigate
the poignancy of present pain. Temperance she commands to take only a certain quantity
even of the most favorite food, lest, through immoderate use, anything prove hurtful by
disturbing the health of the body, and thus Pleasure, which the Epicureans make to consist
chiefly in the health of the body, be grievously offended. Thus the virtues, with the whole
dignity of their glory, will be the slaves of Pleasure, as of some imperious and disreputable
woman.</p>
<p>There is nothing, say our philosophers, more disgraceful and monstrous than this picture,
and which the eyes of good men can less endure. And they say the truth. But I do not think
that the picture would be sufficiently becoming, even if it were made so that the virtues
should be represented as the slaves of human glory; for, though that glory be not a luxurious
woman, it is nevertheless puffed up, and has much vanity in it. Wherefore it is unworthy
of the solidity and firmness of the virtues to represent them as serving this glory, so that
Prudence shall provide nothing, Justice distribute nothing, Temperance moderate nothing,
except to the end that men may be pleased and vain glory served. Nor will they be able to
defend themselves from the charge of such baseness, whilst they, by way of being despisers
of glory, disregard the judgment of other men, seem to themselves wise, and please themselves.
For their virtue,—if, indeed, it is virtue at all,—is only in another way subjected to
human praise; for he who seeks to please himself seeks still to please man. But he who, with
true piety towards God, whom he loves, believes, and hopes in, fixes his attention more on
those things in which he displeases himself, than on those things, if there are any such, which
please himself, or rather, not himself, but the truth, does not attribute that by which he can
now please the truth to anything but to the mercy of Him whom he has feared to displease,
giving thanks for what in him is healed, and pouring out prayers for the healing of that
which is yet unhealed.</p>

<pb n="251"/>
<head>Chapter 21.—That the Roman Dominion Was Granted by Him from Whom is All
Power, and by Whose Providence All Things are Ruled.</head>
<p>These things being so, we do not attribute the power of giving kingdoms and empires
to any save to the true God, who gives happiness in the kingdom of heaven to the pious
alone, but gives kingly power on earth both to the pious and the impious, as it may please
Him, whose good pleasure is always just. For though we have said something about the
principles which guide His administration, in so far as it has seemed good to Him to explain
it, nevertheless it is too much for us, and far surpasses our strength, to discuss the hidden
things of men’s hearts, and by a clear examination to determine the merits of various kingdoms.
He, therefore, who is the one true God, who never leaves the human race without
just judgment and help, gave a kingdom to the Romans when He would, and as great as He
would, as He did also to the Assyrians, and even the Persians, by whom, as their own books
testify, only two gods are worshipped, the one good and the other evil,—to say nothing
concerning the Hebrew people, of whom I have already spoken as much as seemed necessary,
who, as long as they were a kingdom, worshipped none save the true God. The same,
therefore, who gave to the Persians harvests, though they did not worship the goddess Segetia,
who gave the other blessings of the earth, though they did not worship the many gods which
the Romans supposed to preside, each one over some particular thing, or even many of
them over each several thing,—He, I say, gave the Persians dominion, though they worshipped
none of those gods to whom the Romans believed themselves indebted for the
empire. And the same is true in respect of men as well as nations. He who gave power to
Marius gave it also to Caius Cæsar; He who gave it to Augustus gave it also to Nero; He also
who gave it to the most benignant emperors, the Vespasians, father and son, gave it also to
the cruel Domitian; and, finally, to avoid the necessity of going over them all, He who gave
it to the Christian Constantine gave it also to the apostate Julian, whose gifted mind was
deceived by a sacrilegious and detestable curiosity, stimulated by the love of power. And it
was because he was addicted through curiosity to vain oracles, that, confident of victory, he
burned the ships which were laden with the provisions necessary for his army, and therefore,
engaging with hot zeal in rashly audacious enterprises, he was soon slain, as the just consequence
of his recklessness, and left his army unprovisioned in an enemy’s country, and
in such a predicament that it never could have escaped, save by altering the boundaries of
the Roman empire, in violation of that omen of the god Terminus of which I spoke in the
preceding book; for the god Terminus yielded to necessity, though he had not yielded to
Jupiter. Manifestly these things are ruled and governed by the one God according as He
pleases; and if His motives are hid, are they therefore unjust?</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—The Durations and Issues of War Depend on the Will of God.</head>
<p>Thus also the durations of wars are determined by Him as He may see meet, according
to His righteous will, and pleasure, and mercy, to afflict or to console the human race, so
that they are sometimes of longer, sometimes of shorter duration. The war of the Pirates
and the third Punic war were terminated with incredible celerity. Also the war of the fugitive
gladiators, though in it many Roman generals and the consuls were defeated, and Italy was
terribly wasted and ravaged, was nevertheless ended in the third year, having itself been,
during its continuance, the end of much. The Picentes, the Marsi, and the Peligni, not distant
but Italian nations, after a long and most loyal servitude under the Roman yoke, attempted
to raise their heads into liberty, though many nations had now been subjected to the Roman
power, and Carthage had been overthrown. In this Italian war the Romans were very often
defeated, and two consuls perished, besides other noble senators; nevertheless this calamity
was not protracted over a long space of time, for the fifth year put an end to it. But the
second Punic war, lasting for the space of eighteen years, and occasioning the greatest disasters
and calamities to the republic, wore out and well-nigh consumed the strength of the
Romans; for in two battles about seventy thousand Romans fell.226 The first Punic war was
terminated after having been waged for three-and-twenty years. The Mithridatic war was
waged for forty years. And that no one may think that in the early and much belauded times
of the Romans they were far braver and more able to bring wars to a speedy termination,
the Samnite war was protracted for nearly fifty years; and in this war the Romans were so
beaten that they were even put under the yoke. But because they did not love glory for the
sake of justice, but seemed rather to have loved justice for the sake of glory, they broke the
peace and the treaty which had been concluded. These things I mention, because many,
ignorant of past things, and some also dissimulating what they know, if in Christian times
they see any war protracted a little longer than they expected, straightway make a fierce
and insolent attack on our religion, exclaiming that, but for it, the deities would have been
supplicated still, according to ancient rites; and then, by that bravery of the Romans, which,
with the help of Mars and Bellona, speedily brought to an end such great wars, this war also
would be speedily terminated. Let them, therefore, who have read history recollect what
long-continued wars, having various issues and entailing woeful slaughter, were waged by
the ancient Romans, in accordance with the general truth that the earth, like the tempestuous
deep, is subject to agitations from tempests—tempests of such evils, in various degrees,—and
let them sometimes confess what they do not like to own, and not, by madly speaking against
God, destroy themselves and deceive the ignorant.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Concerning the War in Which Radagaisus, King of the Goths, a
Worshipper of Demons, Was Conquered in One Day, with All His Mighty Forces.</head>
<p>Nevertheless they do not mention with thanksgiving what God has very recently, and
within our own memory, wonderfully and mercifully done, but as far as in them lies they
attempt, if possible, to bury it in universal oblivion. But should we be silent about these
things, we should be in like manner ungrateful. When Radagaisus, king of the Goths, having
taken up his position very near to the city, with a vast and savage army, was already close
upon the Romans, he was in one day so speedily and so thoroughly beaten, that, whilst not
even one Roman was wounded, much less slain, far more than a hundred thousand of his
army were prostrated, and he himself and his sons, having been captured, were forthwith
put to death, suffering the punishment they deserved. For had so impious a man, with so
great and so impious a host, entered the city, whom would he have spared? what tombs of
the martyrs would he have respected? in his treatment of what person would he have
manifested the fear of God? whose blood would he have refrained from shedding? whose
chastity would he have wished to preserve inviolate? But how loud would they not have
been in the praises of their gods! How insultingly they would have boasted, saying that
Radagaisus had conquered, that he had been able to achieve such great things, because he
propitiated and won over the gods by daily sacrifices,—a thing which the Christian religion
did not allow the Romans to do! For when he was approaching to those places where he
was overwhelmed at the nod of the Supreme Majesty, as his fame was everywhere increasing,
it was being told us at Carthage that the pagans were believing, publishing, and boasting,
that he, on account of the help and protection of the gods friendly to him, because of the
sacrifices which he was said to be daily offering to them, would certainly not be conquered
by those who were not performing such sacrifices to the Roman gods, and did not even
permit that they should be offered by any one. And now these wretched men do not give
thanks to God for his great mercy, who, having determined to chastise the corruption of
men, which was worthy of far heavier chastisement than the corruption of the barbarians,
tempered His indignation with such mildness as, in the first instance, to cause that the king
of the Goths should be conquered in a wonderful manner, lest glory should accrue to demons,
whom he was known to be supplicating, and thus the minds of the weak should be overthrown;
and then, afterwards, to cause that, when Rome was to be taken, it should be taken
by those barbarians who, contrary to any custom of all former wars, protected, through
reverence for the Christian religion, those who fled for refuge to the sacred places, and who
so opposed the demons themselves, and the rites of impious sacrifices, that they seemed to
be carrying on a far more terrible war with them than with men. Thus did the true Lord
and Governor of things both scourge the Romans mercifully, and, by the marvellous defeat
of the worshippers of demons, show that those sacrifices were not necessary even for the
safety of present things; so that, by those who do not obstinately hold out, but prudently

<pb n="254"/>
consider the matter, true religion may not be deserted on account of the urgencies of the
present time, but may be more clung to in most confident expectation of eternal life.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—What Was the Happiness of the Christian Emperors, and How Far It
Was True Happiness.</head>
<p>For neither do we say that certain Christian emperors were therefore happy because
they ruled a long time, or, dying a peaceful death, left their sons to succeed them in the
empire, or subdued the enemies of the republic, or were able both to guard against and to
suppress the attempt of hostile citizens rising against them. These and other gifts or comforts
of this sorrowful life even certain worshippers of demons have merited to receive, who do
not belong to the kingdom of God to which these belong; and this is to be traced to the
mercy of God, who would not have those who believe in Him desire such things as the
highest good. But we say that they are happy if they rule justly; if they are not lifted up amid
the praises of those who pay them sublime honors, and the obsequiousness of those who
salute them with an excessive humility, but remember that they are men; if they make their
power the handmaid of His majesty by using it for the greatest possible extension of His
worship; if they fear, love, worship God; if more than their own they love that kingdom in
which they are not afraid to have partners; if they are slow to punish, ready to pardon; if
they apply that punishment as necessary to government and defence of the republic, and
not in order to gratify their own enmity; if they grant pardon, not that iniquity may go unpunished,
but with the hope that the transgressor may amend his ways; if they compensate
with the lenity of mercy and the liberality of benevolence for whatever severity they may be
compelled to decree; if their luxury is as much restrained as it might have been unrestrained;
if they prefer to govern depraved desires rather than any nation whatever; and if they do all
these things, not through ardent desire of empty glory, but through love of eternal felicity,
not neglecting to offer to the true God, who is their God, for their sins, the sacrifices of humility,
contrition, and prayer. Such Christian emperors, we say, are happy in the present
time by hope, and are destined to be so in the enjoyment of the reality itself, when that which
we wait for shall have arrived.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Concerning the Prosperity Which God Granted to the Christian Emperor
Constantine.</head>
<p>For the good God, lest men, who believe that He is to be worshipped with a view to
eternal life, should think that no one could attain to all this high estate, and to this terrestrial
dominion, unless he should be a worshipper of the demons,—supposing that these spirits
have great power with respect to such things,—for this reason He gave to the Emperor
Constantine, who was not a worshipper of demons, but of the true God Himself, such fullness
of earthly gifts as no one would even dare wish for. To him also He granted the honor of
founding a city,227 a companion to the Roman empire, the daughter, as it were, of Rome
itself, but without any temple or image of the demons. He reigned for a long period as sole
emperor, and unaided held and defended the whole Roman world. In conducting and carrying
on wars he was most victorious; in overthrowing tyrants he was most successful. He
died at a great age, of sickness and old age, and left his sons to succeed him in the empire.228
But again, lest any emperor should become a Christian in order to merit the happiness of
Constantine, when every one should be a Christian for the sake of eternal life, God took
away Jovian far sooner than Julian, and permitted that Gratian should be slain by the sword
of a tyrant. But in his case there was far more mitigation of the calamity than in the case of
the great Pompey, for he could not be avenged by Cato, whom he had left, as it were, heir
to the civil war. But Gratian, though pious minds require not such consolations, was avenged
by Theodosius, whom he had associated with himself in the empire, though he had a little
brother of his own, being more desirous of a faithful alliance than of extensive power.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—On the Faith and Piety of Theodosius Augustus.</head>
<p>And on this account, Theodosius not only preserved during the lifetime of Gratian that
fidelity which was due to him, but also, after his death, he, like a true Christian, took his
little brother Valentinian under his protection, as joint emperor, after he had been expelled
by Maximus, the murderer of his father. He guarded him with paternal affection, though
he might without any difficulty have got rid of him, being entirely destitute of all resources,
had he been animated with the desire of extensive empire, and not with the ambition of
being a benefactor. It was therefore a far greater pleasure to him, when he had adopted the
boy, and preserved to him his imperial dignity, to console him by his very humanity and
kindness. Afterwards, when that success was rendering Maximus terrible, Theodosius, in
the midst of his perplexing anxieties, was not drawn away to follow the suggestions of a
sacrilegious and unlawful curiosity, but sent to John, whose abode was in the desert of
Egypt,—for he had learned that this servant of God (whose fame was spreading abroad) was
endowed with the gift of prophecy,—and from him he received assurance of victory. Immediately
the slayer of the tyrant Maximus, with the deepest feelings of compassion and respect,
restored the boy Valentinianus to his share in the empire from which he had been driven.
Valentinianus being soon after slain by secret assassination, or by some other plot or accident,
Theodosius, having again received a response from the prophet, and placing entire
confidence in it, marched against the tyrant Eugenius, who had been unlawfully elected to
succeed that emperor, and defeated his very powerful army, more by prayer than by the
sword. Some soldiers who were at the battle reported to me that all the missiles they were
throwing were snatched from their hands by a vehement wind, which blew from the direction
of Theodosius’ army upon the enemy; nor did it only drive with greater velocity the darts
which were hurled against them, but also turned back upon their own bodies the darts which
they themselves were throwing. And therefore the poet Claudian, although an alien from
the name of Christ, nevertheless says in his praises of him, “O prince, too much beloved by
God, for thee Æolus pours armed tempests from their caves; for thee the air fights, and the
winds with one accord obey thy bugles.”229 But the victor, as he had believed and predicted,
overthrew the statues of Jupiter, which had been, as it were, consecrated by I know not what
kind of rites against him, and set up in the Alps. And the thunderbolts of these statues,
which were made of gold, he mirthfully and graciously presented to his couriers who (as
the joy of the occasion permitted) were jocularly saying that they would be most happy to
be struck by such thunderbolts. The sons of his own enemies, whose fathers had been slain
not so much by his orders as by the vehemence of war, having fled for refuge to a church,
though they were not yet Christians, he was anxious, taking advantage of the occasion, to
bring over to Christianity, and treated them with Christian love. Nor did he deprive them
<note type="footnote">229 Panegyr, de tertio Honorii consulatu.</note>

<pb n="258"/>
of their property, but, besides allowing them to retain it, bestowed on them additional
honors. He did not permit private animosities to affect the treatment of any man after the
war. He was not like Cinna, and Marius, and Sylla, and other such men, who wished not
to finish civil wars even when they were finished, but rather grieved that they had arisen at
all, than wished that when they were finished they should harm any one. Amid all these
events, from the very commencement of his reign, he did not cease to help the troubled
church against the impious by most just and merciful laws, which the heretical Valens, favoring
the Arians, had vehemently afflicted. Indeed, he rejoiced more to be a member of
this church than he did to be a king upon the earth. The idols of the Gentiles he everywhere
ordered to be overthrown, understanding well that not even terrestrial gifts are placed in
the power of demons, but in that of the true God. And what could be more admirable than
his religious humility, when, compelled by the urgency of certain of his intimates, he avenged
the grievous crime of the Thessalonians, which at the prayer of the bishops he had promised
to pardon, and, being laid hold of by the discipline of the church, did penance in such a way
that the sight of his imperial loftiness prostrated made the people who were interceding for
him weep more than the consciousness of offence had made them fear it when enraged?
These and other similar good works, which it would be long to tell, he carried with him
from this world of time, where the greatest human nobility and loftiness are but vapor. Of
these works the reward is eternal happiness, of which God is the giver, though only to those
who are sincerely pious. But all other blessings and privileges of this life, as the world itself,
light, air, earth, water, fruits, and the soul of man himself, his body, senses, mind, life, He
lavishes on good and bad alike. And among these blessings is also to be reckoned the possession
of an empire, whose extent He regulates according to the requirements of His
providential government at various times. Whence, I see, we must now answer those who,
being confuted and convicted by the most manifest proofs, by which it is shown that for
obtaining these terrestrial things, which are all the foolish desire to have, that multitude of
false gods is of no use, attempt to assert that the gods are to be worshipped with a view to
the interest, not of the present life, but of that which is to come after death. For as to those
who, for the sake of the friendship of this world, are willing to worship vanities, and do not
grieve that they are left to their puerile understandings, I think they have been sufficiently
answered in these five books; of which books, when I had published the first three, and they
had begun to come into the hands of many, I heard that certain persons were preparing
against them an answer of some kind or other in writing. Then it was told me that they had
already written their answer, but were waiting a time when they could publish it without
danger. Such persons I would advise not to desire what cannot be of any advantage to them;
for it is very easy for a man to seem to himself to have answered arguments, when he has
only been unwilling to be silent. For what is more loquacious than vanity? And though it
be able, if it like, to shout more loudly than the truth, it is not, for all that, more powerful

<pb n="259"/>
than the truth. But let men consider diligently all the things that we have said, and if, perchance,
judging without party spirit, they shall clearly perceive that they are such things as
may rather be shaken than torn up by their most impudent garrulity, and, as it were, satirical
and mimic levity, let them restrain their absurdities, and let them choose rather to be
corrected by the wise than to be lauded by the foolish. For if they are waiting an opportunity,
not for liberty to speak the truth, but for license to revile, may not that befall them which
Tully says concerning some one, “Oh, wretched man! who was at liberty to sin?”230
Wherefore, whoever he be who deems himself happy because of license to revile, he would
be far happier if that were not allowed him at all; for he might all the while, laying aside
empty boast, be contradicting those to whose views he is opposed by way of free consultation
with them, and be listening, as it becomes him, honorably, gravely, candidly, to all that can
be adduced by those whom he consults by friendly disputation.</p>

<p>Argument—Hitherto the argument has been conducted against those who believe that
the gods are to be worshipped for the sake of temporal advantages, now it is directed against
those who believe that they are to be worshipped for the sake of eternal life. Augustin devotes
the five following books to the confutation of this latter belief, and first of all shows how mean
an opinion of the gods was held by Varro himself, the most esteemed writer on heathen theology.
Of this theology Augustin adopts Varro’s division into three kinds, mythical, natural,
and civil; and at once demonstrates that neither the mythical nor the civil can contribute
anything to the happiness of the future life.</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<pb n="261"/>
<head>Preface.</head>
<p>In the five former books, I think I have sufficiently disputed against those who believe
that the many false gods, which the Christian truth shows to be useless images, or unclean
spirits and pernicious demons, or certainly creatures, not the Creator, are to be worshipped
for the advantage of this mortal life, and of terrestrial affairs, with that rite and service which
the Greeks call λατρεία, and which is due to the one true God. And who does not know
that, in the face of excessive stupidity and obstinacy, neither these five nor any other number
of books whatsoever could be enough, when it is esteemed the glory of vanity to yield to no
amount of strength on the side of truth,—certainly to his destruction over whom so heinous
a vice tyrannizes? For, notwithstanding all the assiduity of the physician who attempts to
effect a cure, the disease remains unconquered, not through any fault of his, but because of
the incurableness of the sick man. But those who thoroughly weigh the things which they
read, having understood and considered them, without any, or with no great and excessive
degree of that obstinacy which belongs to a long-cherished error, will more readily judge
that, in the five books already finished, we have done more than the necessity of the question
demanded, than that we have given it less discussion than it required. And they cannot
have doubted but that all the hatred which the ignorant attempt to bring upon the Christian
religion on account of the disasters of this life, and the destruction and change which befall
terrestrial things, whilst the learned do not merely dissimulate, but encourage that hatred,
contrary to their own consciences, being possessed by a mad impiety;—they cannot have
doubted, I say, but that this hatred is devoid of right reflection and reason, and full of most
light temerity, and most pernicious animosity.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Of Those Who Maintain that They Worship the Gods Not for the Sake
of Temporal But Eternal Advantages.</head>
<p>Now, as, in the next place (as the promised order demands), those are to be refuted and
taught who contend that the gods of the nations, which the Christian truth destroys, are to
be worshipped not on account of this life, but on account of that which is to be after death,
I shall do well to commence my disputation with the truthful oracle of the holy psalm,
“Blessed is the man whose hope is the Lord God, and who respecteth not vanities and lying
follies.”231 Nevertheless, in all vanities and lying follies the philosophers are to be listened
to with far more toleration, who have repudiated those opinions and errors of the people;
for the people set up images to the deities, and either feigned concerning those whom they
call immortal gods many false and unworthy things, or believed them, already feigned, and,
when believed, mixed them up with their worship and sacred rites.</p>
<p>With those men who, though not by free avowal of their convictions, do still testify that
they disapprove of those things by their muttering disapprobation during disputations on
the subject, it may not be very far amiss to discuss the following question: Whether for the
sake of the life which is to be after death, we ought to worship, not the one God who made
all creatures spiritual and corporeal, but those many gods who, as some of these philosophers
hold, were made by that one God, and placed by Him in their respective sublime spheres,
and are therefore considered more excellent and more noble than all the others?232 But
who will assert that it must be affirmed and contended that those gods, certain of whom I
have mentioned in the fourth book,233 to whom are distributed, each to each, the charges
of minute things, do bestow eternal life? But will those most skilled and most acute men,
who glory in having written for the great benefit of men, to teach on what account each god
is to be worshipped, and what is to be sought from each, lest with most disgraceful absurdity,
such as a mimic is wont for the sake of merriment to exhibit, water should be sought from
Liber, wine from the Lymphs,—will those men indeed affirm to any man supplicating the
immortal gods, that when he shall have asked wine from the Lymphs, and they shall have
answered him, “We have water, seek wine from Liber,” he may rightly say, “If ye have not
wine, at least give me eternal life?” What more monstrous than this absurdity? Will not
these Lymphs,—for they are wont to be very easily made laugh,234—laughing loudly (if they
do not attempt to deceive like demons), answer the suppliant, “O man, dost thou think that
we have life (vitam) in our power, who thou hearest have not even the vine (vitem)?” It is
therefore most impudent folly to seek and hope for eternal life from such gods as are asserted
<note type="footnote">231 Ps. xl. 4.</note>

<note type="footnote">233 Ch. xi. and xxi.</note>
<note type="footnote">234 See Virgil, Ec. iii. 9.</note>

<pb n="263"/>
so to preside over the separate minute concernments of this most sorrowful and short life,
and whatever is useful for supporting and propping it, as that if anything which is under
the care and power of one be sought from another, it is so incongruous and absurd that it
appears very like to mimic drollery,—which, when it is done by mimics knowing what they
are doing, is deservedly laughed at in the theatre, but when it is done by foolish persons,
who do not know better, is more deservedly ridiculed in the world. Wherefore, as concerns
those gods which the states have established, it has been cleverly invented and handed down
to memory by learned men, what god or goddess is to be supplicated in relation to every
particular thing,—what, for instance, is to be sought from Liber, what from the Lymphs,
what from Vulcan, and so of all the rest, some of whom I have mentioned in the fourth
book, and some I have thought right to omit. Further, if it is an error to seek wine from
Ceres, bread from Liber, water from Vulcan, fire from the Lymphs, how much greater absurdity
ought it to be thought, if supplication be made to any one of these for eternal life?</p>
<p>Wherefore, if, when we were inquiring what gods or goddesses are to be believed to be
able to confer earthly kingdoms upon men, all things having been discussed, it was shown
to be very far from the truth to think that even terrestrial kingdoms are established by any
of those many false deities, is it not most insane impiety to believe that eternal life, which
is, without any doubt or comparison, to be preferred to all terrestrial kingdoms, can be
given to any one by any of these gods? For the reason why such gods seemed to us not to
be able to give even an earthly kingdom, was not because they are very great and exalted,
whilst that is something small and abject, which they, in their so great sublimity, would not
condescend to care for, but because, however deservedly any one may, in consideration of
human frailty, despise the falling pinnacles of an earthly kingdom, these gods have presented
such an appearance as to seem most unworthy to have the granting and preserving of even
those entrusted to them; and consequently, if (as we have taught in the two last books of
our work, where this matter is treated of) no god out of all that crowd, either belonging to,
as it were, the plebeian or to the noble gods, is fit to give mortal kingdoms to mortals, how
much less is he able to make immortals of mortals?</p>
<p>And more than this, if, according to the opinion of those with whom we are now arguing,
the gods are to be worshipped, not on account of the present life, but of that which is to be
after death, then, certainly, they are not to be worshipped on account of those particular
things which are distributed and portioned out (not by any law of rational truth, but by
mere vain conjecture) to the power of such gods, as they believe they ought to be worshipped,
who contend that their worship is necessary for all the desirable things of this mortal life,
against whom I have disputed sufficiently, as far as I was able, in the five preceding books.
These things being so, if the age itself of those who worshipped the goddess Juventas should
be characterized by remarkable vigor, whilst her despisers should either die within the years
of youth, or should, during that period, grow cold as with the torpor of old age; if bearded

<pb n="264"/>
Fortuna should cover the cheeks of her worshippers more handsomely and more gracefully
than all others, whilst we should see those by whom she was despised either altogether
beardless or ill-bearded; even then we should most rightly say, that thus far these several
gods had power, limited in some way by their functions, and that, consequently, neither
ought eternal life to be sought from Juventas, who could not give a beard, nor ought any
good thing after this life to be expected from Fortuna Barbata, who has no power even in
this life to give the age itself at which the beard grows. But now, when their worship is necessary
not even on account of those very things which they think are subjected to their
power,—for many worshippers of the goddess Juventas have not been at all vigorous at that
age, and many who do not worship her rejoice in youthful strength; and also many suppliants
of Fortuna Barbata have either not been able to attain to any beard at all, not even an ugly
one, although they who adore her in order to obtain a beard are ridiculed by her bearded
despisers,—is the human heart really so foolish as to believe that that worship of the gods,
which it acknowledges to be vain and ridiculous with respect to those very temporal and
swiftly passing gifts, over each of which one of these gods is said to preside, is fruitful in
results with respect to eternal life? And that they are able to give eternal life has not been
affirmed even by those who, that they might be worshipped by the silly populace, distributed
in minute division among them these temporal occupations, that none of them might sit
idle; for they had supposed the existence of an exceedingly great number.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—What We are to Believe that Varro Thought Concerning the Gods of
the Nations, Whose Various Kinds and Sacred Rites He Has Shown to Be Such
that He Would Have Acted More Reverently Towards Them Had He Been Altogether
Silent Concerning Them.</head>
<p>Who has investigated those things more carefully than Marcus Varro? Who has discovered
them more learnedly? Who has considered them more attentively? Who has distinguished
them more acutely? Who has written about them more diligently and more
fully?—who, though he is less pleasing in his eloquence, is nevertheless so full of instruction
and wisdom, that in all the erudition which we call secular, but they liberal, he will teach
the student of things as much as Cicero delights the student of words. And even Tully
himself renders him such testimony, as to say in his Academic books that he had held that
disputation which is there carried on with Marcus Varro, “a man,” he adds, “unquestionably
the acutest of all men, and, without any doubt, the most learned.”235 He does not say the
most eloquent or the most fluent, for in reality he was very deficient in this faculty, but he
says, “of all men the most acute.” And in those books,—that is, the Academic,—where he
contends that all things are to be doubted, he adds of him, “without any doubt the most
learned.” In truth, he was so certain concerning this thing, that he laid aside that doubt
which he is wont to have recourse to in all things, as if, when about to dispute in favor of
the doubt of the Academics, he had, with respect to this one thing, forgotten that he was an
Academic. But in the first book, when he extols the literary works of the same Varro, he
says, “Us straying and wandering in our own city like strangers, thy books, as it were, brought
home, that at length we might come to know of who we were and where we were. Thou
has opened up to us the age of the country, the distribution of seasons, the laws of sacred
things, and of the priests; thou hast opened up to us domestic and public discipline; thou
hast pointed out to us the proper places for religious ceremonies, and hast informed us
concerning sacred places. Thou hast shown us the names, kinds, offices, causes of all divine
and human things.”236</p>
<p>This man, then, of so distinguished and excellent acquirements, and, as Terentian briefly
says of him in a most elegant verse,</p>
<p>“Varro, a man universally informed,”237</p>
<p>who read so much that we wonder when he had time to write, wrote so much that we
can scarcely believe any one could have read it all,—this man, I say, so great in talent, so
great in learning, had he been an opposer and destroyer of the so-called divine things of

<pb n="266"/>
which he wrote, and had he said that they pertained to superstition rather than to religion,
might perhaps, even in that case, not have written so many things which are ridiculous,
contemptible, detestable. But when he so worshipped these same gods, and so vindicated
their worship, as to say, in that same literary work of his, that he was afraid lest they should
perish, not by an assault by enemies, but by the negligence of the citizens, and that from
this ignominy they are being delivered by him, and are being laid up and preserved in the
memory of the good by means of such books, with a zeal far more beneficial than that
through which Metellus is declared to have rescued the sacred things of Vesta from the
flames, and Æneas to have rescued the Penates from the burning of Troy; and when he
nevertheless, gives forth such things to be read by succeeding ages as are deservedly judged
by wise and unwise to be unfit to be read, and to be most hostile to the truth of religion;
what ought we to think but that a most acute and learned man,—not, however made free
by the Holy Spirit,—was overpowered by the custom and laws of his state, and, not being
able to be silent about those things by which he was influenced, spoke of them under pretence
of commending religion?</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Varro’s Distribution of His Book Which He Composed Concerning
the Antiquities of Human and Divine Things.</head>
<p>He wrote forty-one books of antiquities. These he divided into human and divine
things. Twenty-five he devoted to human things, sixteen to divine things; following this
plan in that division,—namely, to give six books to each of the four divisions of human
things. For he directs his attention to these considerations: who perform, where they perform,
when they perform, what they perform. Therefore in the first six books he wrote
concerning men; in the second six, concerning places; in the third six, concerning times; in
the fourth and last six, concerning things. Four times six, however, make only twenty-four.
But he placed at the head of them one separate work, which spoke of all these things conjointly.</p>
<p>In divine things, the same order he preserved throughout, as far as concerns those things
which are performed to the gods. For sacred things are performed by men in places and
times. These four things I have mentioned he embraced in twelve books, allotting three to
each. For he wrote the first three concerning men, the following three concerning places,
the third three concerning times, and the fourth three concerning sacred rites,—showing
who should perform, where they should perform, when they should perform, what they
should perform, with most subtle distinction. But because it was necessary to say—and that
especially was expected—to whom they should perform sacred rites, he wrote concerning
the gods themselves the last three books; and these five times three made fifteen. But they
are in all, as we have said, sixteen. For he put also at the beginning of these one distinct
book, speaking by way of introduction of all which follows; which being finished, he proceeded
to subdivide the first three in that five-fold distribution which pertain to men,
making the first concerning high priests, the second concerning augurs, the third concerning
the fifteen men presiding over the sacred ceremonies.238 The second three he made concerning
places, speaking in one of them concerning their chapels, in the second concerning
their temples, and in the third concerning religious places. The next three which follow
these, and pertain to times,—that is, to festival days,—he distributed so as to make one
concerning holidays, the other concerning the circus games, and the third concerning
scenic plays. Of the fourth three, pertaining to sacred things, he devoted one to consecrations,
another to private, the last to public, sacred rites. In the three which remain, the gods
themselves follow this pompous train, as it were, for whom all this culture has been expended.
In the first book are the certain gods, in the second the uncertain, in the third, and last of
all, the chief and select gods.</p>
<note type="footnote">238 Tarquin the Proud, having bought the books of the sibyl, appointed two men to preserve and interpret

<head>Chapter 4.—That from the Disputation of Varro, It Follows that the Worshippers
of the Gods Regard Human Things as More Ancient Than Divine Things.</head>
<p>In this whole series of most beautiful and most subtle distributions and distinctions, it
will most easily appear evident from the things we have said already, and from what is to
be said hereafter, to any man who is not, in the obstinacy of his heart, an enemy to himself,
that it is vain to seek and to hope for, and even most impudent to wish for eternal life. For
these institutions are either the work of men or of demons,—not of those whom they call
good demons, but, to speak more plainly, of unclean, and, without controversy, malign
spirits, who with wonderful slyness and secretness suggest to the thoughts of the impious,
and sometimes openly present to their understandings, noxious opinions, by which the
human mind grows more and more foolish, and becomes unable to adapt itself to and abide
in the immutable and eternal truth, and seek to confirm these opinions by every kind of
fallacious attestation in their power. This very same Varro testifies that he wrote first concerning
human things, but afterwards concerning divine things, because the states existed
first, and afterward these things were instituted by them. But the true religion was not instituted
by any earthly state, but plainly it established the celestial city. It, however, is inspired
and taught by the true God, the giver of eternal life to His true worshippers.</p>
<p>The following is the reason Varro gives when he confesses that he had written first
concerning human things, and afterwards of divine things, because these divine things were
instituted by men:—“As the painter is before the painted tablet, the mason before the edifice,
so states are before those things which are instituted by states.” But he says that he would
have written first concerning the gods, afterwards concerning men, if he had been writing
concerning the whole nature of the gods,—as if he were really writing concerning some
portion of, and not all, the nature of the gods; or as if, indeed, some portion of, though not
all, the nature of the gods ought not to be put before that of men. How, then, comes it that
in those three last books, when he is diligently explaining the certain, uncertain and select
gods, he seems to pass over no portion of the nature of the gods? Why, then, does he say,
“If we had been writing on the whole nature of the gods, we would first have finished the
divine things before we touched the human?” For he either writes concerning the whole
nature of the gods, or concerning some portion of it, or concerning no part of it at all. If
concerning it all, it is certainly to be put before human things; if concerning some part of
it, why should it not, from the very nature of the case, precede human things? Is not even
some part of the gods to be preferred to the whole of humanity? But if it is too much to
prefer a part of the divine to all human things, that part is certainly worthy to be preferred
to the Romans at least. For he writes the books concerning human things, not with reference
to the whole world, but only to Rome; which books he says he had properly placed, in the
order of writing, before the books on divine things, like a painter before the painted tablet,
or a mason before the building, most openly confessing that, as a picture or a structure, even

<pb n="269"/>
these divine things were instituted by men. There remains only the third supposition, that
he is to be understood to have written concerning no divine nature, but that he did not wish
to say this openly, but left it to the intelligent to infer; for when one says “not all,” usage
understands that to mean “some,” but it may be understood as meaning none, because that
which is none is neither all nor some. In fact, as he himself says, if he had been writing
concerning all the nature of the gods, its due place would have been before human things
in the order of writing. But, as the truth declares, even though Varro is silent, the divine
nature should have taken precedence of Roman things, though it were not all, but only
some. But it is properly put after, therefore it is none. His arrangement, therefore, was due,
not to a desire to give human things priority to divine things, but to his unwillingness to
prefer false things to true. For in what he wrote on human things, he followed the history
of affairs; but in what he wrote concerning those things which they call divine, what else
did he follow but mere conjectures about vain things? This, doubtless, is what, in a subtle
manner, he wished to signify; not only writing concerning divine things after the human,
but even giving a reason why he did so; for if he had suppressed this, some, perchance, would
have defended his doing so in one way, and some in another. But in that very reason he has
rendered, he has left nothing for men to conjecture at will, and has sufficiently proved that
he preferred men to the institutions of men, not the nature of men to the nature of the gods.
Thus he confessed that, in writing the books concerning divine things, he did not write
concerning the truth which belongs to nature, but the falseness which belongs to error;
which he has elsewhere expressed more openly (as I have mentioned in the fourth book239),
saying that, had he been founding a new city himself, he would have written according to
the order of nature; but as he had only found an old one, he could not but follow its custom.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Concerning the Three Kinds of Theology According to Varro, Namely,
One Fabulous, the Other Natural, the Third Civil.</head>
<p>Now what are we to say of this proposition of his, namely, that there are three kinds of
theology, that is, of the account which is given of the gods; and of these, the one is called
mythical, the other physical, and the third civil? Did the Latin usage permit, we should call
the kind which he has placed first in order fabular,240 but let us call it fabulous,241 for
mythical is derived from the Greek μῦθος, a fable; but that the second should be called
natural, the usage of speech now admits; the third he himself has designated in Latin, call
ing it civil.242 Then he says, “they call that kind mythical which the poets chiefly use; physical,
that which the philosophers use; civil, that which the people use. As to the first I have
mentioned,” says he, “in it are many fictions, which are contrary to the dignity and nature
of the immortals. For we find in it that one god has been born from the head, another from
the thigh, another from drops of blood; also, in this we find that gods have stolen, committed
adultery, served men; in a word, in this all manner of things are attributed to the gods, such
as may befall, not merely any man, but even the most contemptible man.” He certainly,
where he could, where he dared, where he thought he could do it with impunity, has manifested,
without any of the haziness of ambiguity, how great injury was done to the nature
of the gods by lying fables; for he was speaking, not concerning natural theology, not concerning
civil, but concerning fabulous theology, which he thought he could freely find fault
with.</p>
<p>Let us see, now, what he says concerning the second kind. “The second kind which I
have explained,” he says, “is that concerning which philosophers have left many books, in
which they treat such questions as these: what gods there are, where they are, of what kind
and character they are, since what time they have existed, or if they have existed from
eternity; whether they are of fire, as Heraclitus believes; or of number, as Pythagoras; or of
atoms, as Epicurus says; and other such things, which men’s ears can more easily hear inside
the walls of a school than outside in the Forum.” He finds fault with nothing in this kind
of theology which they call physical, and which belongs to philosophers, except that he has
related their controversies among themselves, through which there has arisen a multitude
of dissentient sects. Nevertheless he has removed this kind from the Forum, that is, from
the populace, but he has shut it up in schools. But that first kind, most false and most base,
he has not removed from the citizens. Oh, the religious ears of the people, and among them
even those of the Romans, that are not able to bear what the philosophers dispute concerning
the gods! But when the poets sing and stage-players act such things as are derogatory to
<note type="footnote">240 Fabulare.</note>
<note type="footnote">241 Fabulosum.</note>
<note type="footnote">242 Civile.</note>

<pb n="271"/>
the dignity and the nature of the immortals, such as may befall not a man merely, but the
most contemptible man, they not only bear, but willingly listen to. Nor is this all, but they
even consider that these things please the gods, and that they are propitiated by them.</p>
<p>But some one may say, Let us distinguish these two kinds of theology, the mythical and
the physical,—that is, the fabulous and the natural,—from this civil kind about which we
are now speaking. Anticipating this, he himself has distinguished them. Let us see now
how he explains the civil theology itself. I see, indeed, why it should be distinguished as
fabulous, even because it is false, because it is base, because it is unworthy. But to wish to
distinguish the natural from the civil, what else is that but to confess that the civil itself is
false? For if that be natural, what fault has it that it should be excluded? And if this which
is called civil be not natural, what merit has it that it should be admitted? This, in truth, is
the cause why he wrote first concerning human things, and afterwards concerning divine
things; since in divine things he did not follow nature, but the institution of men. Let us
look at this civil theology of his. “The third kind,” says he, “is that which citizens in cities,
and especially the priests, ought to know and to administer. From it is to be known what
god each one may suitably worship, what sacred rites and sacrifices each one may suitably
perform.” Let us still attend to what follows. “The first theology,” he says, “is especially
adapted to the theatre, the second to the world, the third to the city.” Who does not see to
which he gives the palm? Certainly to the second, which he said above is that of the philosophers.
For he testifies that this pertains to the world, than which they think there is
nothing better. But those two theologies, the first and the third,—to wit, those of the theatre
and of the city,—has he distinguished them or united them? For although we see that the
city is in the world, we do not see that it follows that any things belonging to the city pertain
to the world. For it is possible that such things may be worshipped and believed in the city,
according to false opinions, as have no existence either in the world or out of it. But where
is the theatre but in the city? Who instituted the theatre but the state? For what purpose
did it constitute it but for scenic plays? And to what class of things do scenic plays belong
but to those divine things concerning which these books of Varro’s are written with so much
ability?</p>

<pb n="272"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—Concerning the Mythic, that Is, the Fabulous, Theology, and the Civil,
Against Varro.</head>
<p>O Marcus Varro! thou art the most acute, and without doubt the most learned, but still
a man, not God,—now lifted up by the Spirit of God to see and to announce divine things,
thou seest, indeed, that divine things are to be separated from human trifles and lies, but
thou fearest to offend those most corrupt opinions of the populace, and their customs in
public superstitions, which thou thyself, when thou considerest them on all sides, perceivest,
and all your literature loudly pronounces to be abhorrent from the nature of the gods, even
of such gods as the frailty of the human mind supposes to exist in the elements of this world.
What can the most excellent human talent do here? What can human learning, though
manifold, avail thee in this perplexity? Thou desirest to worship the natural gods; thou art
compelled to worship the civil. Thou hast found some of the gods to be fabulous, on whom
thou vomitest forth very freely what thou thinkest, and, whether thou willest or not, thou
wettest therewith even the civil gods. Thou sayest, forsooth, that the fabulous are adapted
to the theatre, the natural to the world, and the civil to the city; though the world is a divine
work, but cities and theatres are the works of men, and though the gods who are laughed
at in the theatre are not other than those who are adored in the temples; and ye do not exhibit
games in honor of other gods than those to whom ye immolate victims. How much
more freely and more subtly wouldst thou have decided these hadst thou said that some
gods are natural, others established by men; and concerning those who have been so established,
the literature of the poets gives one account, and that of the priests another,—both
of which are, nevertheless, so friendly the one to the other, through fellowship in falsehood,
that they are both pleasing to the demons, to whom the doctrine of the truth is hostile.</p>
<p>That theology, therefore, which they call natural, being put aside for a moment, as it is
afterwards to be discussed, we ask if any one is really content to seek a hope for eternal life
from poetical, theatrical, scenic gods? Perish the thought! The true God avert so wild and
sacrilegious a madness! What, is eternal life to be asked from those gods whom these things
pleased, and whom these things propitiate, in which their own crimes are represented? No
one, as I think, has arrived at such a pitch of headlong and furious impiety. So then, neither
by the fabulous nor by the civil theology does any one obtain eternal life. For the one sows
base things concerning the gods by feigning them, the other reaps by cherishing them; the
one scatters lies, the other gathers them together; the one pursues divine things with false
crimes, the other incorporates among divine things the plays which are made up of these
crimes; the one sounds abroad in human songs impious fictions concerning the gods, the
other consecrates these for the festivities of the gods themselves; the one sings the misdeeds
and crimes of the gods, the other loves them; the one gives forth or feigns, the other either
attests the true or delights in the false. Both are base; both are damnable. But the one which
is theatrical teaches public abomination, and that one which is of the city adorns itself with

<pb n="273"/>
that abomination. Shall eternal life be hoped for from these, by which this short and temporal
life is polluted? Does the society of wicked men pollute our life if they insinuate
themselves into our affections, and win our assent? and does not the society of demons
pollute the life, who are worshipped with their own crimes?—if with true crimes, how wicked
the demons! if with false, how wicked the worship!</p>
<p>When we say these things, it may perchance seem to some one who is very ignorant of
these matters that only those things concerning the gods which are sung in the songs of the
poets and acted on the stage are unworthy of the divine majesty, and ridiculous, and too
detestable to be celebrated, whilst those sacred things which not stage-players but priests
perform are pure and free from all unseemliness. Had this been so, never would any one
have thought that these theatrical abominations should be celebrated in their honor, never
would the gods themselves have ordered them to be performed to them. But men are in
nowise ashamed to perform these things in the theatres, because similar things are carried
on in the temples. In short, when the fore-mentioned author attempted to distinguish the
civil theology from the fabulous and natural, as a sort of third and distinct kind, he wished
it to be understood to be rather tempered by both than separated from either. For he says
that those things which the poets write are less than the people ought to follow, whilst what
the philosophers say is more than it is expedient for the people to pry into. “Which,” says
he, “differ in such a way, that nevertheless not a few things from both of them have been
taken to the account of the civil theology; wherefore we will indicate what the civil theology
has in common with that of the poet, though it ought to be more closely connected with
the theology of philosophers.” Civil theology is therefore not quite disconnected from that
of the poets. Nevertheless, in another place, concerning the generations of the gods, he says
that the people are more inclined toward the poets than toward the physical theologists.
For in this place he said what ought to be done; in that other place, what was really done.
He said that the latter had written for the sake of utility, but the poets for the sake of
amusement. And hence the things from the poets’ writings, which the people ought not to
follow, are the crimes of the gods; which, nevertheless, amuse both the people and the gods.
For, for amusement’s sake, he says, the poets write, and not for that of utility; nevertheless
they write such things as the gods will desire, and the people perform.</p>

<pb n="274"/>
<head>Chapter 7.—Concerning the Likeness and Agreement of the Fabulous and Civil
Theologies.</head>
<p>That theology, therefore, which is fabulous, theatrical, scenic, and full of all baseness
and unseemliness, is taken up into the civil theology; and part of that theology, which in its
totality is deservedly judged to be worthy of reprobation and rejection, is pronounced worthy
to be cultivated and observed;—not at all an incongruous part, as I have undertaken to show,
and one which, being alien to the whole body, was unsuitably attached to and suspended
from it, but a part entirely congruous with, and most harmoniously fitted to the rest, as a
member of the same body. For what else do those images, forms, ages, sexes, characteristics
of the gods show? If the poets have Jupiter with a beard and Mercury beardless, have not
the priests the same? Is the Priapus of the priests less obscene than the Priapus of the players?
Does he receive the adoration of worshippers in a different form from that in which he
moves about the stage for the amusement of spectators? Is not Saturn old and Apollo young
in the shrines where their images stand as well as when represented by actors’ masks? Why
are Forculus, who presides over doors, and Limentinus, who presides over thresholds and
lintels, male gods, and Cardea between them feminine, who presides over hinges? Are not
those things found in books on divine things, which grave poets have deemed unworthy of
their verses? Does the Diana of the theatre carry arms, whilst the Diana of the city is simply
a virgin? Is the stage Apollo a lyrist, but the Delphic Apollo ignorant of this art? But these
things are decent compared with the more shameful things. What was thought of Jupiter
himself by those who placed his wet nurse in the Capitol? Did they not bear witness to Euhemerus,
who, not with the garrulity of a fable-teller, but with the gravity of an historian
who had diligently investigated the matter, wrote that all such gods had been men and
mortals? And they who appointed the Epulones as parasites at the table of Jupiter, what
else did they wish for but mimic sacred rites. For if any mimic had said that parasites of
Jupiter were made use of at his table, he would assuredly have appeared to be seeking to call
forth laughter. Varro said it,—not when he was mocking, but when he was commending
the gods did he say it. His books on divine, not on human, things testify that he wrote
this,—not where he set forth the scenic games, but where he explained the Capitoline laws.
In a word, he is conquered, and confesses that, as they made the gods with a human form,
so they believed that they are delighted with human pleasures.</p>
<p>For also malign spirits were not so wanting to their own business as not to confirm
noxious opinions in the minds of men by converting them into sport. Whence also is that
story about the sacristan of Hercules, which says that, having nothing to do, he took to
playing at dice as a pastime, throwing them alternately with the one hand for Hercules, with
the other for himself, with this understanding, that if he should win, he should from the
funds of the temple prepare himself a supper, and hire a mistress; but if Hercules should
win the game, he himself should, at his own expense, provide the same for the pleasure of

<pb n="275"/>
Hercules. Then, when he had been beaten by himself, as though by Hercules, he gave to
the god Hercules the supper he owed him, and also the most noble harlot Larentina. But
she, having fallen asleep in the temple, dreamed that Hercules had had intercourse with her,
and had said to her that she would find her payment with the youth whom she should first
meet on leaving the temple, and that she was to believe this to be paid to her by Hercules.
And so the first youth that met her on going out was the wealthy Tarutius, who kept her a
long time, and when he died left her his heir. She, having obtained a most ample fortune,
that she should not seem ungrateful for the divine hire, in her turn made the Roman people
her heir, which she thought to be most acceptable to the deities; and, having disappeared,
the will was found. By which meritorious conduct they say that she gained divine honors.</p>
<p>Now had these things been feigned by the poets and acted by the mimics, they would
without any doubt have been said to pertain to the fabulous theology, and would have been
judged worthy to be separated from the dig nity of the civil theology. But when these
shameful things,—not of the poets, but of the people; not of the mimics, but of the sacred
things; not of the theatres, but of the temples, that is, not of the fabulous, but of the civil
theology,—are reported by so great an author, not in vain do the actors represent with theatrical
art the baseness of the gods, which is so great; but surely in vain do the priests attempt,
by rites called sacred, to represent their nobleness of character, which has no existence.
There are sacred rites of Juno; and these are celebrated in her beloved island, Samos, where
she was given in marriage to Jupiter. There are sacred rites of Ceres, in which Proserpine
is sought for, having been carried off by Pluto. There are sacred rites of Venus, in which,
her beloved Adonis being slain by a boar’s tooth, the lovely youth is lamented. There are
sacred rites of the mother of the gods, in which the beautiful youth Atys, loved by her, and
castrated by her through a woman’s jealousy, is deplored by men who have suffered the like
calamity, whom they call Galli. Since, then, these things are more unseemly than all scenic
abomination, why is it that they strive to separate, as it were, the fabulous fictions of the
poet concerning the gods, as, forsooth, pertaining to the theatre, from the civil theology
which they wish to belong to the city, as though they were separating from noble and worthy
things, things unworthy and base? Wherefore there is more reason to thank the stage-actors,
who have spared the eyes of men and have not laid bare by theatrical exhibition all the things
which are hid by the walls of the temples. What good is to be thought of their sacred rites
which are concealed in darkness, when those which are brought forth into the light are so
detestable? And certainly they themselves have seen what they transact in secret through
the agency of mutilated and effeminate men. Yet they have not been able to conceal those
same men miserably and vile enervated and corrupted. Let them persuade whom they can
that they transact anything holy through such men, who, they cannot deny, are numbered,
and live among their sacred things. We know not what they transact, but we know through
whom they transact; for we know what things are transacted on the stage, where never, even

<pb n="276"/>
in a chorus of harlots, hath one who is mutilated or an effeminate appeared. And, nevertheless,
even these things are acted by vile and infamous characters; for, indeed, they ought not
to be acted by men of good character. What, then, are those sacred rites, for the performance
of which holiness has chosen such men as not even the obscenity of the stage has admitted?</p>

<pb n="277"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—Concerning the Interpretations, Consisting of Natural Explanations,
Which the Pagan Teachers Attempt to Show for Their Gods.</head>
<p>But all these things, they say, have certain physical, that is, natural interpretations,
showing their natural meaning; as though in this disputation we were seeking physics and
not theology, which is the account, not of nature, but of God. For although He who is the
true God is God, not by opinion, but by nature, nevertheless all nature is not God; for there
is certainly a nature of man, of a beast, of a tree, of a stone,—none of which is God. For if,
when the question is concerning the mother of the gods, that from which the whole system
of interpretation starts certainly is, that the mother of the gods is the earth, why do we make
further inquiry? why do we carry our investigation through all the rest of it? What can more
manifestly favor them who say that all those gods were men? For they are earth-born in the
sense that the earth is their mother. But in the true theology the earth is the work, not the
mother, of God. But in whatever way their sacred rites may be interpreted, and whatever
reference they may have to the nature of things, it is not according to nature, but contrary
to nature, that men should be effeminates. This disease, this crime, this abomination, has
a recognized place among those sacred things, though even depraved men will scarcely be
compelled by torments to confess they are guilty of it. Again, if these sacred rites, which
are proved to be fouler than scenic abominations, are excused and justified on the ground
that they have their own interpretations, by which they are shown to symbolize the nature
of things, why are not the poetical things in like manner excused and justified? For many
have interpreted even these in like fashion, to such a degree that even that which they say
is the most monstrous and most horrible,—namely, that Saturn devoured his own children,—
has been interpreted by some of them to mean that length of time, which is signified
by the name of Saturn, consumes whatever it begets; or that, as the same Varro thinks, Saturn
belongs to seeds which fall back again into the earth from whence they spring. And so one
interprets it in one way, and one in another. And the same is to be said of all the rest of this
theology.</p>
<p>And, nevertheless, it is called the fabulous theology, and is censured, cast off, rejected,
together with all such interpretations belonging to it. And not only by the natural theology,
which is that of the philosophers, but also by this civil theology, concerning which we are
speaking, which is asserted to pertain to cities and peoples, it is judged worthy of repudiation,
because it has invented unworthy things concerning the gods. Of which, I wot, this is the
secret: that those most acute and learned men, by whom those things were written, understood
that both theologies ought to be rejected,—to wit, both that fabulous and this civil
one,—but the former they dared to reject, the latter they dared not; the former they set forth
to be censured, the latter they showed to be very like it; not that it might be chosen to be
held in preference to the other, but that it might be understood to be worthy of being rejected
together with it. And thus, without danger to those who feared to censure the civil theology,

both of them being brought into contempt, that theology which they call natural might find
a place in better disposed minds; for the civil and the fabulous are both fabulous and both
civil. He who shall wisely inspect the vanities and obscenities of both will find that they are
both fabulous; and he who shall direct his attention to the scenic plays pertaining to the
fabulous theology in the festivals of the civil gods, and in the divine rites of the cities, will
find they are both civil. How, then, can the power of giving eternal life be attributed to any
of those gods whose own images and sacred rites convict them of being most like to the
fabulous gods, which are most openly reprobated, in forms, ages, sex, characteristics, marriages,
generations, rites; in all which things they are understood either to have been men,
and to have had their sacred rites and solemnities instituted in their honor according to the
life or death of each of them, the demons suggesting and confirming this error, or certainly
most foul spirits, who, taking advantage of some occasion or other, have stolen into the
minds of men to deceive them?</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Concerning the Special Offices of the Gods.</head>
<p>And as to those very offices of the gods, so meanly and so minutely portioned out, so
that they say that they ought to be supplicated, each one according to his special function,—
about which we have spoken much already, though not all that is to be said concerning
it,—are they not more consistent with mimic buffoonery than divine majesty? If any one
should use two nurses for his infant, one of whom should give nothing but food, the other
nothing but drink, as these make use of two goddesses for this purpose, Educa and Potina,
he should certainly seem to be foolish, and to do in his house a thing worthy of a mimic.
They would have Liber to have been named from “liberation,” because through him males
at the time of copulation are liberated by the emission of the seed. They also say that Libera
(the same in their opinion as Venus) exercises the same function in the case of women, because
they say that they also emit seed; and they also say that on this account the same part
of the male and of the female is placed in the temple, that of the male to Liber, and that of
the female to Libera. To these things they add the women assigned to Liber, and the wine
for exciting lust. Thus the Bacchanalia are celebrated with the utmost insanity, with respect
to which Varro himself confesses that such things would not be done by the Bacchanals
except their minds were highly excited. These things, however, afterwards displeased a
saner senate, and it ordered them to be discontinued. Here, at length, they perhaps perceived
how much power unclean spirits, when held to be gods, exercise over the minds of men.
These things, certainly, were not to be done in the theatres; for there they play, not rave,
although to have gods who are delighted with such plays is very like raving.</p>
<p>But what kind of distinction is this which he makes between the religious and the superstitious
man, saying that the gods are feared243 by the superstitious man, but are reverenced244
as parents by the religious man, not feared as enemies; and that they are all so good
that they will more readily spare those who are impious than hurt one who is innocent?
And yet he tells us that three gods are assigned as guardians to a woman after she has been
delivered, lest the god Silvanus come in and molest her; and that in order to signify the
presence of these protectors, three men go round the house during the night, and first strike
the threshold with a hatchet, next with a pestle, and the third time sweep it with a brush, in
order that these symbols of agriculture having been exhibited, the god Silvanus might be
hindered from entering, because neither are trees cut down or pruned without a hatchet,
neither is grain ground without a pestle, nor corn heaped up without a besom. Now from
these three things three gods have been named: Intercidona, from the cut245 made by the
hatchet; Pilumnus, from the pestle; Diverra, from the besom;—by which guardian gods the
<note type="footnote">243 Timeri.</note>
<note type="footnote">244 Vereri.</note>
<note type="footnote">245 Intercido, I cut or cleave.</note>

<pb n="280"/>
woman who has been de livered is preserved against the power of the god Silvanus. Thus
the guardianship of kindly-disposed gods would not avail against the malice of a mischievous
god, unless they were three to one, and fought against him, as it were, with the opposing
emblems of cultivation, who, being an inhabitant of the woods, is rough, horrible, and uncultivated.
Is this the innocence of the gods? Is this their concord? Are these the healthgiving
deities of the cities, more ridiculous than the things which are laughed at in the
theatres?</p>
<p>When a male and a female are united, the god Jugatinus presides. Well, let this be borne
with. But the married woman must be brought home: the god Domiducus also is invoked.
That she may be in the house, the god Domitius is introduced. That she may remain with
her husband, the goddess Manturnæ is used. What more is required? Let human modesty
be spared. Let the lust of flesh and blood go on with the rest, the secret of shame being respected.
Why is the bed-chamber filled with a crowd of deities, when even the groomsmen246
have departed? And, moreover, it is so filled, not that in consideration of their presence
more regard may be paid to chastity, but that by their help the woman, naturally of the
weaker sex, and trembling with the novelty of her situation, may the more readily yield her
virginity. For there are the goddess Virginiensis, and the god-father Subigus, and the goddessmother
Prema, and the goddess Pertunda, and Venus, and Priapus.247 What is this? If it
was absolutely necessary that a man, laboring at this work, should be helped by the gods,
might not some one god or goddess have been sufficient? Was Venus not sufficient alone,
who is even said to be named from this, that without her power a woman does not cease to
be a virgin? If there is any shame in men, which is not in the deities, is it not the case that,
when the married couple believe that so many gods of either sex are present, and busy at
this work, they are so much affected with shame, that the man is less moved, and the woman
more reluctant? And certainly, if the goddess Virginiensis is present to loose the virgin’s
zone, if the god Subigus is present that the virgin may be got under the man, if the goddess
Prema is present that, having been got under him, she may be kept down, and may not move
herself, what has the goddess Pertunda to do there? Let her blush; let her go forth. Let the
husband himself do something. It is disgraceful that any one but himself should do that
from which she gets her name. But perhaps she is tolerated because she is said to be a goddess,
and not a god. For if she were believed to be a male, and were called Pertundus, the
husband would demand more help against him for the chastity of his wife than the newlydelivered
woman against Silvanus. But why am I saying this, when Priapus, too, is there, a
male to excess, upon whose immense and most unsightly member the newly-married bride
is commanded to sit, according to the most honorable and most religious custom of matrons?</p>

<p>Let them go on, and let them attempt with all the subtlety they can to distinguish the
civil theology from the fabulous, the cities from the theatres, the temples from the stages,
the sacred things of the priests from the songs of the poets, as honorable things from base
things, truthful things from fallacious, grave from light, serious from ludicrous, desirable
things from things to be rejected, we understand what they do. They are aware that that
theatrical and fabulous theology hangs by the civil, and is reflected back upon it from the
songs of the poets as from a mirror; and thus, that theology having been exposed to view
which they do not dare to condemn, they more freely assail and censure that picture of it,
in order that those who perceive what they mean may detest this very face itself of which
that is the picture,—which, however, the gods themselves, as though seeing themselves in
the same mirror, love so much, that it is better seen in both of them who and what they are.
Whence, also, they have compelled their worshippers, with terrible commands, to dedicate
to them the uncleanness of the fabulous theology, to put them among their solemnities, and
reckon them among divine things; and thus they have both shown themselves more manifestly
to be most impure spirits, and have made that rejected and reprobated theatrical
theology a member and a part of this, as it were, chosen and approved theology of the city,
so that, though the whole is disgraceful and false, and contains in it fictitious gods, one part
of it is in the literature of the priests, the other in the songs of the poets. Whether it may
have other parts is another question. At present, I think, I have sufficiently shown, on account
of the division of Varro, that the theology of the city and that of the theatre belong to one
civil theology. Wherefore, because they are both equally disgraceful, absurd, shameful, false,
far be it from religious men to hope for eternal life from either the one or the other.</p>
<p>In fine, even Varro himself, in his account and enumeration of the gods, starts from the
moment of a man’s conception. He commences the series of those gods who take charge
of man with Janus, carries it on to the death of the man decrepit with age, and terminates
it with the goddess Nænia, who is sung at the funerals of the aged. After that, he begins to
give an account of the other gods, whose province is not man himself, but man’s belongings,
as food, clothing, and all that is necessary for this life; and, in the case of all these, he explains
what is the special office of each, and for what each ought to be supplicated. But with all
this scrupulous and comprehensive diligence, he has neither proved the existence, nor so
much as mentioned the name, of any god from whom eternal life is to be sought,—the one
object for which we are Christians. Who, then, is so stupid as not to perceive that this man,
by setting forth and opening up so diligently the civil theology, and by exhibiting its likeness
to that fabulous, shameful, and disgraceful theology, and also by teaching that that fabulous
sort is also a part of this other, was laboring to obtain a place in the minds of men for none
but that natural theology, which he says pertains to philosophers, with such subtlety that
he censures the fabulous, and, not daring openly to censure the civil, shows its censurable
character by simply exhibiting it; and thus, both being reprobated by the judgment of men

<pb n="282"/>
of right understanding, the natural alone remains to be chosen? But concerning this in its
own place, by the help of the true God, we have to discuss more diligently.</p>

<pb n="283"/>
<head>Chapter 10.—Concerning the Liberty of Seneca, Who More Vehemently Censured
the Civil Theology Than Varro Did the Fabulous.</head>
<p>That liberty, in truth, which this man wanted, so that he did not dare to censure that
theology of the city, which is very similar to the theatrical, so openly as he did the theatrical
itself, was, though not fully, yet in part possessed by Annæus Seneca, whom we have some
evidence to show to have flourished in the times of our apostles. It was in part possessed
by him, I say, for he possessed it in writing, but not in living. For in that book which he
wrote against superstition,248 he more copiously and vehemently censured that civil and
urban theology than Varro the theatrical and fabulous. For, when speaking concerning
images, he says, “They dedicate images of the sacred and inviolable immortals in most
worthless and motionless matter. They give them the appearance of man, beasts, and fishes,
and some make them of mixed sex, and heterogeneous bodies. They call them deities, when
they are such that if they should get breath and should suddenly meet them, they would be
held to be monsters.” Then, a while afterwards, when extolling the natural theology, he had
expounded the sentiments of certain philosophers, he opposes to himself a question, and
says, “Here some one says, Shall I believe that the heavens and the earth are gods, and that
some are above the moon and some below it? Shall I bring forward either Plato or the
peripatetic Strato, one of whom made God to be without a body, the other without a mind?”
In answer to which he says, “And, really, what truer do the dreams of Titus Tatius, or Romulus,
or Tullus Hostilius appear to thee? Tatius declared the divinity of the goddess
Cloacina; Romulus that of Picus and Tiberinus; Tullus Hostilius that of Pavor and Pallor,
the most disagreeable affections of men, the one of which is the agitation of the mind under
fright, the other that of the body, not a disease, indeed, but a change of color.” Wilt thou
rather believe that these are deities, and receive them into heaven? But with what freedom
he has written concerning the rites themselves, cruel and shameful! “One,” he says, “castrates
himself, another cuts his arms. Where will they find room for the fear of these gods when
angry, who use such means of gaining their favor when propitious? But gods who wish to
be worshipped in this fashion should be worshipped in none. So great is the frenzy of the
mind when perturbed and driven from its seat, that the gods are propitiated by men in a
manner in which not even men of the greatest ferocity and fable-renowned cruelty vent
their rage. Tyrants have lacerated the limbs of some; they never ordered any one to lacerate
his own. For the gratification of royal lust, some have been castrated; but no one ever, by
the command of his lord, laid violent hands on himself to emasculate himself. They kill
themselves in the temples. They supplicate with their wounds and with their blood. If any
one has time to see the things they do and the things they suffer, he will find so many things
unseemly for men of respectability, so unworthy of freemen, so unlike the doings of sane
<note type="footnote">248 Mentioned also by Tertullian, Apol. 12, but not extant.</note>

<pb n="284"/>
men, that no one would doubt that they are mad, had they been mad with the minority; but
now the multitude of the insane is the defence of their sanity.”</p>
<p>He next relates those things which are wont to be done in the Capitol, and with the
utmost intrepidity insists that they are such things as one could only believe to be done by
men making sport, or by madmen. For having spoken with derision of this, that in the
Egyptian sacred rites Osiris, being lost, is lamented for, but straightway, when found, is the
occasion of great joy by his reappearance, because both the losing and the finding of him
are feigned; and yet that grief and that joy which are elicited thereby from those who have
lost nothing and found nothing are real;—having I say, so spoken of this, he says, “Still there
is a fixed time for this frenzy. It is tolerable to go mad once in the year. Go into the Capitol.
One is suggesting divine commands249 to a god; another is telling the hours to Jupiter; one
is a lictor; another is an anointer, who with the mere movement of his arms imitates one
anointing. There are women who arrange the hair of Juno and Minerva, standing far away
not only from her image, but even from her temple. These move their fingers in the manner
of hairdressers. There are some women who hold a mirror. There are some who are calling
the gods to assist them in court. There are some who are holding up documents to them,
and are explaining to them their cases. A learned and distinguished comedian, now old and
decrepit, was daily playing the mimic in the Capitol, as though the gods would gladly be
spectators of that which men had ceased to care about. Every kind of artificers working for
the immortal gods is dwelling there in idleness.” And a little after he says, “Nevertheless
these, though they give themselves up to the gods for purposes superflous enough, do not
do so for any abominable or infamous purpose. There sit certain women in the Capitol
who think they are beloved by Jupiter; nor are they frightened even by the look of the, if
you will believe the poets, most wrathful Juno.”</p>
<p>This liberty Varro did not enjoy. It was only the poetical theology he seemed to censure.
The civil, which this man cuts to pieces, he was not bold enough to impugn. But if we attend
to the truth, the temples where these things are performed are far worse than the theatres
where they are represented. Whence, with respect to these sacred rites of the civil theology,
Seneca preferred, as the best course to be followed by a wise man, to feign respect for them
in act, but to have no real regard for them at heart. “All which things,” he says, “a wise man
will observe as being commanded by the laws, but not as being pleasing to the gods.” And
a little after he says, “And what of this, that we unite the gods in marriage, and that not even
naturally, for we join brothers and sisters? We marry Bellona to Mars, Venus to Vulcan,
Salacia to Neptune. Some of them we leave unmarried, as though there were no match for
them, which is surely needless, especially when there are certain unmarried goddesses, as
<note type="footnote">249 Numina. Another reading is nomina; and with either reading another translation is admissible; “One is
announcing to a god the names (or gods) who salute him.”</note>

<pb n="285"/>
Populonia, or Fulgora, or the goddess Rumina, for whom I am not astonished that suitors
have been awanting. All this ignoble crowd of gods, which the superstition of ages has
amassed, we ought,” he says, “to adore in such a way as to remember all the while that its
worship belongs rather to custom than to reality.” Wherefore, neither those laws nor customs
instituted in the civil theology that which was pleasing to the gods, or which pertained to
reality. But this man, whom philosophy had made, as it were, free, nevertheless, because
he was an illustrious senator of the Roman people, worshipped what he censured, did what
he condemned, adored what he reproached, because, forsooth, philosophy had taught him
something great,—namely, not to be superstitious in the world, but, on account of the laws
of cities and the customs of men, to be an actor, not on the stage, but in the temples,—conduct
the more to be condemned, that those things which he was deceitfully acting he so acted
that the people thought he was acting sincerely. But a stage-actor would rather delight
people by acting plays than take them in by false pretences.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—What Seneca Thought Concerning the Jews.</head>
<p>Seneca, among the other superstitions of civil theology, also found fault with the sacred
things of the Jews, and especially the sabbaths, affirming that they act uselessly in keeping
those seventh days, whereby they lose through idleness about the seventh part of their life,
and also many things which demand immediate attention are damaged. The Christians,
however, who were already most hostile to the Jews, he did not dare to mention, either for
praise or blame, lest, if he praised them, he should do so against the ancient custom of his
country, or, perhaps, if he should blame them, he should do so against his own will.</p>
<p>When he was speaking concerning those Jews, he said, “When, meanwhile, the customs
of that most accursed nation have gained such strength that they have been now received
in all lands, the conquered have given laws to the conquerors.” By these words he expresses
his astonishment; and, not knowing what the providence of God was leading him to say,
subjoins in plain words an opinion by which he showed what he thought about the meaning
of those sacred institutions: “For,” he says, “those, however, know the cause of their rites,
whilst the greater part of the people know not why they perform theirs.” But concerning
the solemnities of the Jews, either why or how far they were instituted by divine authority,
and afterwards, in due time, by the same authority taken away from the people of God, to
whom the mystery of eternal life was revealed, we have both spoken elsewhere, especially
when we were treating against the Manichæans, and also intend to speak in this work in a
more suitable place.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—That When Once the Vanity of the Gods of the Nations Has Been
Exposed, It Cannot Be Doubted that They are Unable to Bestow Eternal Life on
Any One, When They Cannot Afford Help Even with Respect to the Things Of
this Temporal Life.</head>
<p>Now, since there are three theologies, which the Greeks call respectively mythical,
physical, and political, and which may be called in Latin fabulous, natural, and civil; and
since neither from the fabulous, which even the worshippers of many and false gods have
themselves most freely censured, nor from the civil, of which that is convicted of being a
part, or even worse than it, can eternal life be hoped for from any of these theologies,—if
any one thinks that what has been said in this book is not enough for him, let him also add
to it the many and various dissertations concerning God as the giver of felicity, contained
in the former books, especially the fourth one.</p>
<p>For to what but to felicity should men consecrate themselves, were felicity a goddess?
However, as it is not a goddess, but a gift of God, to what God but the giver of happiness
ought we to consecrate ourselves, who piously love eternal life, in which there is true and
full felicity? But I think, from what has been said, no one ought to doubt that none of those
gods is the giver of happiness, who are worshipped with such shame, and who, if they are
not so worshipped, are more shamefully enraged, and thus confess that they are most foul
spirits. Moreover, how can he give eternal life who cannot give happiness? For we mean
by eternal life that life where there is endless happiness. For if the soul live in eternal punishments,
by which also those unclean spirits shall be tormented, that is rather eternal death
than eternal life. For there is no greater or worse death than when death never dies. But
because the soul from its very nature, being created immortal, cannot be without some kind
of life, its utmost death is alienation from the life of God in an eternity of punishment. So,
then, He only who gives true happiness gives eternal life, that is, an endlessly happy life.
And since those gods whom this civil theology worships have been proved to be unable to
give this happiness, they ought not to be worshipped on account of those temporal and
terrestrial things, as we showed in the five former books, much less on account of eternal
life, which is to be after death, as we have sought to show in this one book especially, whilst
the other books also lend it their co-operation. But since the strength of inveterate habit
has its roots very deep, if any one thinks that I have not disputed sufficiently to show that
this civil theology ought to be rejected and shunned, let him attend to another book which,
with God’s help, is to be joined to this one.</p>

<p>It will be the duty of those who are endowed with quicker and better understandings,
in whose case the former books are sufficient, and more than sufficient, to effect their intended

ordinary diligence to tear up and eradicate depraved and ancient opinions hostile to the
truth of piety, which the long-continued error of the human race has fixed very deeply in
unenlightened minds; co-operating also in this, according to my little measure, with the
grace of Him who, being the true God, is able to accomplish it, and on whose help I depend
in my work; and, for the sake of others, such should not deem superfluous what they feel
to be no longer necessary for themselves. A very great matter is at stake when the true and
truly holy divinity is commended to men as that which they ought to seek after and to
worship; not, however, on account of the transitory vapor of mortal life, but on account of
life eternal, which alone is blessed, although the help necessary for this frail life we are now
living is also afforded us by it.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Whether, Since It is Evident that Deity is Not to Be Found in the Civil
Theology, We are to Believe that It is to Be Found in the Select Gods.</head>
<p>If there is any one whom the sixth book, which I have last finished, has not persuaded
that this divinity, or, so to speak, deity—for this word also our authors do not hesitate to
use, in order to translate more accurately that which the Greeks call θεότης;—if there is any
one, I say, whom the sixth book has not persuaded that this divinity or deity is not to be
found in that theology which they call civil, and which Marcus Varro has explained in sixteen
books,—that is, that the happiness of eternal life is not attainable through the worship of
gods such as states have established to be worshipped, and that in such a form,—perhaps,
when he has read this book, he will not have anything further to desire in order to the
clearing up of this question. For it is possible that some one may think that at least the select
and chief gods, whom Varro comprised in his last book, and of whom we have not spoken
sufficiently, are to be worshipped on account of the blessed life, which is none other than
eternal. In respect to which matter I do not say what Tertullian said, perhaps more wittily
than truly, “If gods are selected like onions, certainly the rest are rejected as bad.”250 I do
not say this, for I see that even from among the select, some are selected for some greater
and more excellent office: as in warfare, when recruits have been elected, there are some
again elected from among those for the performance of some greater military service; and
in the church, when persons are elected to be overseers, certainly the rest are not rejected,
since all good Christians are deservedly called elect; in the erection of a building cornerstones
are elected, though the other stones, which are destined for other parts of the structure,
are not rejected; grapes are elected for eating, whilst the others, which we leave for drinking,
are not rejected. There is no need of adducing many illustrations, since the thing is evident.
Wherefore the selection of certain gods from among many affords no proper reason why
either he who wrote on this subject, or the worshippers of the gods, or the gods themselves,
should be spurned. We ought rather to seek to know what gods these are, and for what
purpose they may appear to have been selected.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Who are the Select Gods, and Whether They are Held to Be Exempt
from the Offices of the Commoner Gods.</head>
<p>The following gods, certainly, Varro signalizes as select, devoting one book to this subject:
Janus, Jupiter, Saturn, Genius, Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Vulcan, Neptune, Sol, Orcus,
father Liber, Tellus, Ceres, Juno, Luna, Diana, Minerva, Venus, Vesta; of which twenty gods,
twelve are males, and eight females. Whether are these deities called select, because of their
higher spheres of administration in the world, or because they have become better known
to the people, and more worship has been expended on them? If it be on account of the
greater works which are performed by them in the world, we ought not to have found them
among that, as it were, plebeian crowd of deities, which has assigned to it the charge of
minute and trifling things. For, first of all, at the conception of a foetus, from which point
all the works commence which have been distributed in minute detail to many deities, Janus
himself opens the way for the reception of the seed; there also is Saturn, on account of the
seed itself; there is Liber,251 who liberates the male by the effusion of the seed; there is Libera,
whom they also would have to be Venus, who confers this same benefit on the woman,
namely, that she also be liberated by the emission of the seed;—all these are of the number
of those who are called select. But there is also the goddess Mena, who presides over the
menses; though the daughter of Jupiter, ignoble nevertheless. And this province of the
menses the same author, in his book on the select gods, assigns to Juno herself, who is even
queen among the select gods; and here, as Juno Lucina, along with the same Mena, her
stepdaughter, she presides over the same blood. There also are two gods, exceedingly obscure,
Vitumnus and Sentinus—the one of whom imparts life to the foetus, and the other sensation;
and, of a truth, they bestow, most ignoble though they be, far more than all those noble and
select gods bestow. For, surely, without life and sensation, what is the whole foetus which
a woman carries in her womb, but a most vile and worthless thing, no better than slime and
dust?</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—How There is No Reason Which Can Be Shown for the Selection of
Certain Gods, When the Administration of More Exalted Offices is Assigned to
Many Inferior Gods.</head>
<p>What is the cause, therefore, which has driven so many select gods to these very small
works, in which they are excelled by Vitumnus and Sentinus, though little known and sunk
in obscurity, inasmuch as they confer the munificent gifts of life and sensation? For the
select Janus bestows an entrance, and, as it were, a door252 for the seed; the select Saturn
bestows the seed itself; the select Liber bestows on men the emission of the same seed; Libera,
who is Ceres or Venus, confers the same on women; the select Juno confers (not alone, but
together with Mena, the daughter of Jupiter) the menses, for the growth of that which has
been conceived; and the obscure and ignoble Vitumnus confers life, whilst the obscure and
ignoble Sentinus confers sensation;—which two last things are as much more excellent than
the others, as they themselves are excelled by reason and intellect. For as those things which
reason and understand are preferable to those which, without intellect and reason, as in the
case of cattle, live and feel; so also those things which have been endowed with life and
sensation are deservedly preferred to those things which neither live nor feel. Therefore
Vitumnus the life-giver,253 and Sentinus the sense-giver,254 ought to have been reckoned
among the select gods, rather than Janus the admitter of seed, and Saturn the giver or sower
of seed, and Liber and Libera the movers and liberators of seed; which seed is not worth a
thought, unless it attain to life and sensation. Yet these select gifts are not given by select
gods, but by certain unknown, and, considering their dignity, neglected gods. But if it be
replied that Janus has dominion over all beginnings, and therefore the opening of the way
for conception is not without reason assigned to him; and that Saturn has dominion over
all seeds, and therefore the sowing of the seed whereby a human being is generated cannot
be excluded from his operation; that Liber and Libera have power over the emission of all
seeds, and therefore preside over those seeds which pertain to the procreation of men; that
Juno presides over all purgations and births, and therefore she has also charge of the purgations
of women and the births of human beings;—if they give this reply, let them find an
answer to the question concerning Vitumnus and Sentinus, whether they are willing that
these likewise should have dominion over all things which live and feel. If they grant this,
let them observe in how sublime a position they are about to place them. For to spring from

<pb n="293"/>
seeds is in the earth and of the earth, but to live and feel are supposed to be properties even
of the sidereal gods. But if they say that only such things as come to life in flesh, and are
supported by senses, are assigned to Sentinus, why does not that God who made all things
live and feel, bestow on flesh also life and sensation, in the universality of His operation
conferring also on foetuses this gift? And what, then, is the use of Vitumnus and Sentinus?
But if these, as it were, extreme and lowest things have been committed by Him who presides
universally over life and sense to these gods as to servants, are these select gods then so
destitute of servants, that they could not find any to whom even they might commit those
things, but with all their dignity, for which they are, it seems, deemed worthy to be selected,
were compelled to perform their work along with ignoble ones? Juno is select queen of the
gods, and the sister and wife of Jupiter; nevertheless she is Iterduca, the conductor, to boys,
and performs this work along with a most ignoble pair—the goddesses Abeona and Adeona.
There they have also placed the goddess Mena, who gives to boys a good mind, and she is
not placed among the select gods; as if anything greater could be bestowed on a man than
a good mind. But Juno is placed among the select because she is Iterduca and Domiduca
(she who conducts one on a journey, and who conducts him home again); as if it is of any
advantage for one to make a journey, and to be conducted home again, if his mind is not
good. And yet the goddess who bestows that gift has not been placed by the selectors among
the select gods, though she ought indeed to have been preferred even to Minerva, to whom,
in this minute distribution of work, they have allotted the memory of boys. For who will
doubt that it is a far better thing to have a good mind, than ever so great a memory? For
no one is bad who has a good mind;255 but some who are very bad are possessed of an admirable
memory, and are so much the worse, the less they are able to forget the bad things
which they think. And yet Minerva is among the select gods, whilst the goddess Mena is
hidden by a worthless crowd. What shall I say concerning Virtus? What concerning Felicitas?—
concerning whom I have already spoken much in the fourth book;256 to whom,
though they held them to be goddesses, they have not thought fit to assign a place among
the select gods, among whom they have given a place to Mars and Orcus, the one the causer
of death, the other the receiver of the dead.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, we see that even the select gods themselves work together with the
others, like a senate with the people, in all those minute works which have been minutely
portioned out among many gods; and since we find that far greater and better things are
administered by certain gods who have not been reckoned worthy to be selected than by
those who are called select, it remains that we suppose that they were called select and chief,
not on account of their holding more exalted offices in the world, but because it happened
<note type="footnote">255 As we say, right-minded.</note>
<note type="footnote">256 Ch. 21, 23.</note>

<pb n="294"/>
to them to become better known to the people. And even Varro himself says, that in that
way obscurity had fallen to the lot of some father gods and mother goddesses,257 as it fails
to the lot of man. If, therefore, Felicity ought not perhaps to have been put among the select
gods, because they did not attain to that noble position by merit, but by chance, Fortune at
least should have been placed among them, or rather before them; for they say that that
goddess distributes to every one the gifts she receives, not according to any rational arrangement,
but according as chance may determine. She ought to have held the uppermost place
among the select gods, for among them chiefly it is that she shows what power she has. For
we see that they have been selected not on account of some eminent virtue or rational happiness,
but by that random power of Fortune which the worshippers of these gods think
that she exerts. For that most eloquent man Sallust also may perhaps have the gods themselves
in view when he says: “But, in truth, fortune rules in everything; it renders all things
famous or obscure, according to caprice rather than according to truth.”258 For they cannot
discover a reason why Venus should have been made famous, whilst Virtus has been made
obscure, when the divinity of both of them has been solemnly recognized by them, and their
merits are not to be compared. Again, if she has deserved a noble position on account of
the fact that she is much sought after—for there are more who seek after Venus than after
Virtus—why has Minerva been celebrated whilst Pecunia has been left in obscurity, although
throughout the whole human race avarice allures a far greater number than skill? And even
among those who are skilled in the arts, you will rarely find a man who does not practise
his own art for the purpose of pecuniary gain; and that for the sake of which anything is
made, is always valued more than that which is made for the sake of something else. If,
then, this selection of gods has been made by the judgment of the foolish multitude, why
has not the goddess Pecunia been preferred to Minerva, since there are many artificers for
the sake of money? But if this distinction has been made by the few wise, why has Virtus
been preferred to Venus, when reason by far prefers the former? At all events, as I have
already said, Fortune herself—who, according to those who attribute most influence to her,
renders all things famous or obscure according to caprice rather than according to the
truth—since she has been able to exercise so much power even over the gods, as, according
to her capricious judgment, to render those of them famous whom she would, and those
obscure whom she would; Fortune herself ought to occupy the place of pre-eminence among
the select gods, since over them also she has such pre-eminent power. Or must we suppose
that the reason why she is not among the select is simply this, that even Fortune herself has

<head>Chapter 4.—The Inferior Gods, Whose Names are Not Associated with Infamy,
Have Been Better Dealt with Than the Select Gods, Whose Infamies are Celebrated.</head>
<p>However, any one who eagerly seeks for celebrity and renown, might congratulate those
select gods, and call them fortunate, were it not that he saw that they have been selected
more to their injury than to their honor. For that low crowd of gods have been protected
by their very meanness and obscurity from being overwhelmed with infamy. We laugh,
indeed, when we see them distributed by the mere fiction of human opinions, according to
the special works assigned to them, like those who farm small portions of the public revenue,
or like workmen in the street of the silversmiths,259 where one vessel, in order that it may
go out perfect, passes through the hands of many, when it might have been finished by one
perfect workman. But the only reason why the combined skill of many workmen was thought
necessary, was, that it is better that each part of an art should be learned by a special workman,
which can be done speedily and easily, than that they should all be compelled to be perfect
in one art throughout all its parts, which they could only attain slowly and with difficulty.
Nevertheless there is scarcely to be found one of the non-select gods who has brought infamy
on himself by any crime, whilst there is scarce any one of the select gods who has not received
upon himself the brand of notable infamy. These latter have descended to the humble works
of the others, whilst the others have not come up to their sublime crimes. Concerning Janus,
there does not readily occur to my recollection anything infamous; and perhaps he was such
an one as lived more innocently than the rest, and further removed from misdeeds and
crimes. He kindly received and entertained Saturn when he was fleeing; he divided his
kingdom with his guest, so that each of them had a city for himself,260 the one Janiculum,
and the other Saturnia. But those seekers after every kind of unseemliness in the worship
of the gods have disgraced him, whose life they found to be less disgracful than that of the
other gods, with an image of monstrous deformity, making it sometimes with two faces,
and sometimes, as it were, double, with four faces.261 Did they wish that, as the most of the
select gods had lost shame262 through the perpetration of shameful crimes, his greater innocence
should be marked by a greater number of faces?263</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Concerning the More Secret Doctrine of the Pagans, and Concerning
the Physical Interpretations.</head>
<p>But let us hear their own physical interpretations by which they attempt to color, as
with the appearance of profounder doctrine, the baseness of most miserable error. Varro,
in the first place, commends these interpretations so strongly as to say, that the ancients
invented the images, badges, and adornments of the gods, in order that when those who
went to the mysteries should see them with their bodily eyes, they might with the eyes of
their mind see the soul of the world, and its parts, that is, the true gods; and also that the
meaning which was intended by those who made their images with the human form, seemed
to be this,—namely, that the mind of mortals, which is in a human body, is very like to the
immortal mind,264 just as vessels might be placed to represent the gods, as, for instance, a
wine-vessel might be placed in the temple of Liber, to signify wine, that which is contained
being signified by that which contains. Thus by an image which had the human form the
rational soul was signified, because the human form is the vessel, as it were, in which that
nature is wont to be contained which they attribute to God, or to the gods. These are the
mysteries of doctrine to which that most learned man penetrated in order that he might
bring them forth to the light. But, O thou most acute man, hast thou lost among those
mysteries that prudence which led thee to form the sober opinion, that those who first established
those images for the people took away fear from the citizens and added error, and
that the ancient Romans honored the gods more chastely without images? For it was through
consideration of them that thou wast emboldened to speak these things against the later
Romans. For if those most ancient Romans also had worshipped images, perhaps thou
wouldst have suppressed by the silence of fear all those sentiments (true sentiments, nevertheless)
concerning the folly of setting up images, and wouldst have extolled more loftily,
and more loquaciously, those mysterious doctrines consisting of these vain and pernicious
fictions. Thy soul, so learned and so clever (and for this I grieve much for thee), could
never through these mysteries have reached its God; that is, the God by whom, not with
whom, it was made, of whom it is not a part, but a work,—that God who is not the soul of
all things, but who made every soul, and in whose light alone every soul is blessed, if it be
not ungrateful for His grace.</p>
<p>But the things which follow in this book will show what is the nature of these mysteries,
and what value is to be set upon them. Meanwhile, this most learned man confesses as his
opinion that the soul of the world and its parts are the true gods, from which we perceive
that his theology (to wit, that same natural theology to which he pays great regard) has been
able, in its completeness, to extend itself even to the nature of the rational soul. For in this
book (concerning the select gods) he says a very few things by anticipation concerning the
<note type="footnote">264 Cicero, Tusc. Quæst. v. 13.</note>

<pb n="298"/>
natural theology; and we shall see whether he has been able in that book, by means of
physical interpretations, to refer to this natural theology that civil theology, concerning
which he wrote last when treating of the select gods. Now, if he has been able to do this,
the whole is natural; and in that case, what need was there for distinguishing so carefully
the civil from the natural? But if it has been distinguished by a veritable distinction, then,
since not even this natural theology with which he is so much pleased is true (for though it
has reached as far as the soul, it has not reached to the true God who made the soul), how
much more contemptible and false is that civil theology which is chiefly occupied about
what is corporeal, as will be shown by its very interpretations, which they have with such
diligence sought out and enucleated, some of which I must necessarily mention!</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Concerning the Opinion of Varro, that God is the Soul of the World,
Which Nevertheless, in Its Various Parts, Has Many Souls Whose Nature is Divine.</head>
<p>The same Varro, then, still speaking by anticipation, says that he thinks that God is the
soul of the world (which the Greeks call κόσμος), and that this world itself is God; but as a
wise man, though he consists of body and mind, is nevertheless called wise on account of
his mind, so the world is called God on account of mind, although it consists of mind and
body. Here he seems, in some fashion at least, to acknowledge one God; but that he may
introduce more, he adds that the world is divided into two parts, heaven and earth, which
are again divided each into two parts, heaven into ether and air, earth into water and land,
of all which the ether is the highest, the air second, the water third, and the earth the lowest.
All these four parts, he says, are full of souls; those which are in the ether and air being immortal,
and those which are in the water and on the earth mortal. From the highest part of
the heavens to the orbit of the moon there are souls, namely, the stars and planets; and these
are not only understood to be gods, but are seen to be such. And between the orbit of the
moon and the commencement of the region of clouds and winds there are aerial souls; but
these are seen with the mind, not with the eyes, and are called Heroes, and Lares, and Genii.
This is the natural theology which is briefly set forth in these anticipatory statements, and
which satisfied not Varro only, but many philosophers besides. This I must discuss more
carefully, when, with the help of God, I shall have completed what I have yet to say concerning
the civil theology, as far as it concerns the select gods.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Whether It is Reasonable to Separate Janus and Terminus as Two Distinct
Deities.</head>
<p>Who, then, is Janus, with whom Varro commences? He is the world. Certainly a very
brief and unambiguous reply. Why, then, do they say that the beginnings of things pertain
to him, but the ends to another whom they call Terminus? For they say that two months
have been dedicated to these two gods, with reference to beginnings and ends—January to
Janus, and February to Terminus—over and above those ten months which commence
with March and end with December. And they say that that is the reason why the Terminalia
are celebrated in the month of February, the same month in which the sacred purification
is made which they call Februum, and from which the month derives its name.265 Do the
beginnings of things, therefore, pertain to the world, which is Janus, and not also the ends,
since another god has been placed over them? Do they not own that all things which they
say begin in this world also come to an end in this world? What folly it is, to give him only
half power in work, when in his image they give him two faces! Would it not be a far more
elegant way of interpreting the two-faced image, to say that Janus and Terminus are the
same, and that the one face has reference to beginnings, the other to ends? For one who
works ought to have respect to both. For he who in every forthputting of activity does not
look back on the beginning, does not look forward to the end. Wherefore it is necessary
that prospective intention be connected with retrospective memory. For how shall one find
how to finish anything, if he has forgotten what it was which he had begun? But if they
thought that the blessed life is begun in this world, and perfected beyond the world, and for
that reason attributed to Janus, that is, to the world, only the power of beginnings, they
should certainly have preferred Terminus to him, and should not have shut him out from
the number of the select gods. Yet even now, when the beginnings and ends of temporal
things are represented by these two gods, more honor ought to have been given to Terminus.
For the greater joy is that which is felt when anything is finished; but things begun are always
cause of much anxiety until they are brought to an end, which end he who begins anything
very greatly longs for, fixes his mind on, expects, desires; nor does any one ever rejoice over
anything he has begun, unless it be brought to an end.</p>
<note type="footnote">265 An interesting account of the changes made in the Roman year by Numa is given in Plutarch’s life of that
king. Ovid also (Fasti, ii.) explains the derivation of February, telling us that it was the last month of the old
year, and took its name from the lustrations performed then: Februa Romani dixere piamina patres.</note>

<head>Chapter 8.—For What Reason the Worshippers of Janus Have Made His Image with
Two Faces, When They Would Sometimes Have It Be Seen with Four.</head>
<p>But now let the interpretation of the two-faced image be produced. For they say that
it has two faces, one before and one behind, because our gaping mouths seem to resemble
the world: whence the Greeks call the palate οὐρανός, and some Latin poets,266 he says,
have called the heavens palatum [the palate]; and from the gaping mouth, they say, there is
a way out in the direction of the teeth, and a way in in the direction of the gullet. See what
the world has been brought to on account of a Greek or a poetical word for our palate! Let
this god be worshipped only on account of saliva, which has two open doorways under the
heavens of the palate,—one through which part of it may be spitten out, the other through
which part of it may be swallowed down. Besides, what is more absurd than not to find in
the world itself two doorways opposite to each other, through which it may either receive
anything into itself, or cast it out from itself; and to seek of our throat and gullet, to which
the world has no resemblance, to make up an image of the world in Janus, because the world
is said to resemble the palate, to which Janus bears no likeness? But when they make him
four-faced, and call him double Janus, they interpret this as having reference to the four
quarters of the world, as though the world looked out on anything, like Janus through his
four faces. Again, if Janus is the world, and the world consists of four quarters, then the
image of the two-faced Janus is false. Or if it is true, because the whole world is sometimes
understood by the expression east and west, will any one call the world double when north
and south also are mentioned, as they call Janus double when he has four faces? They have
no way at all of interpreting, in relation to the world, four doorways by which to go in and
to come out as they did in the case of the two-faced Janus, where they found, at any rate in
the human mouth, something which answered to what they said about him; unless perhaps
Neptune come to their aid, and hand them a fish, which, besides the mouth and gullet, has
also the openings of the gills, one on each side. Nevertheless, with all the doors, no soul
escapes this vanity but that one which hears the truth saying, “I am the door.”267</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Concerning the Power of Jupiter, and a Comparison of Jupiter with
Janus.</head>
<p>But they also show whom they would have Jove (who is also called Jupiter) understood
to be. He is the god, say they, who has the power of the causes by which anything comes to
be in the world. And how great a thing this is, that most noble verse of Virgil testifies:</p>
<p>“Happy is he who has learned the causes of things.”268</p>
<p>But why is Janus preferred to him? Let that most acute and most learned man answer
us this question. “Because,” says he, “Janus has dominion over first things, Jupiter over
highest269 things. Therefore Jupiter is deservedly held to be the king of all things; for highest
things are better than first things: for although first things precede in time, highest things
excel by dignity.”</p>
<p>Now this would have been rightly said had the first parts of things which are done been
distinguished from the highest parts; as, for instance, it is the beginning of a thing done to
set out, the highest part to arrive. The commencing to learn is the first part of a thing begun,
the acquirement of knowledge is the highest part. And so of all things: the beginnings are
first, the ends highest. This matter, however, has been already discussed in connection with
Janus and Terminus. But the causes which are attributed to Jupiter are things effecting, not
things effected; and it is impossible for them to be prevented in time by things which are
made or done, or by the beginnings of such things; for the thing which makes is always
prior to the thing which is made. Therefore, though the beginnings of things which are
made or done pertain to Janus, they are nevertheless not prior to the efficient causes which
they attribute to Jupiter. For as nothing takes place without being preceded by an efficient
cause, so without an efficient cause nothing begins to take place. Verily, if the people call
this god Jupiter, in whose power are all the causes of all natures which have been made, and
of all natural things, and worship him with such insults and infamous criminations, they
are guilty of more shocking sacrilege than if they should totally deny the existence of any
god. It would therefore be better for them to call some other god by the name of
Jupiter—some one worthy of base and criminal honors; substituting instead of Jupiter some
vain fiction (as Saturn is said to have had a stone given to him to devour instead of his son,)
which they might make the subject of their blasphemies, rather than speak of that god as
both thundering and committing adultery,—ruling the whole world, and laying himself out
for the commission of so many licentious acts,—having in his power nature and the highest
causes of all natural things, but not having his own causes good.</p>

<note type="footnote">269 Summa, which also includes the meaning—last.</note>

<pb n="303"/>
<p>Next, I ask what place they find any longer for this Jupiter among the gods, if Janus is
the world; for Varro defined the true gods to be the soul of the world, and the parts of it.
And therefore whatever falls not within this definition, is certainly not a true god, according
to them. Will they then say that Jupiter is the soul of the world, and Janus the body —that
is, this visible world? If they say this, it will not be possible for them to affirm that Janus is
a god. For even, according to them, the body of the world is not a god, but the soul of the
world and its parts. Wherefore Varro, seeing this, says that he thinks God is the soul of the
world, and that this world itself is God; but that as a wise man though he consists of soul
and body, is nevertheless called wise from the soul, so the world is called God from the soul,
though it consists of soul and body. Therefore the body of the world alone is not God, but
either the soul of it alone, or the soul and the body together, yet so as that it is God not by
virtue of the body, but by virtue of the soul. If, therefore, Janus is the world, and Janus is a
god, will they say, in order that Jupiter may be a god, that he is some part of Janus? For they
are wont rather to attribute universal existence to Jupiter; whence the saying, “All things
are full of Jupiter.”270 Therefore they must think Jupiter also, in order that he may be a god,
and especially king of the gods, to be the world, that he may rule over the other gods—according
to them, his parts. To this effect, also, the same Varro expounds certain verses of
Valerius Soranus271 in that book which he wrote apart from the others concerning the
worship of the gods. These are the verses:
<lg>
<l>“Almighty Jove, progenitor of kings, and things, and gods,</l>
<l>And eke the mother of the gods, god one and all.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But in the same book he expounds these verses by saying that as the male emits seed,
and the female receives it, so Jupiter, whom they believed to be the world, both emits all
seeds from himself and receives them into himself. For which reason, he says, Soranus
wrote, “Jove, progenitor and mother;” and with no less reason said that one and all were
the same. For the world is one, and in that one are all things.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Whether the Distinction Between Janus and Jupiter is a Proper One.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, Janus is the world, and Jupiter is the world, wherefore are Janus and
Jupiter two gods, while the world is but one? Why do they have separate temples, separate
altars, different rites, dissimilar images? If it be because the nature of beginnings is one,
and the nature of causes another, and the one has received the name of Janus, the other of
Jupiter; is it then the case, that if one man has two distinct offices of authority, or two arts,
two judges or two artificers are spoken of, because the nature of the offices or the arts is
different? So also with respect to one god: if he have the power of beginnings and of causes,
must he therefore be thought to be two gods, because beginnings and causes are two things?
But if they think that this is right, let them also affirm that Jupiter is as many gods as they
have given him surnames, on account of many powers; for the things from which these
surnames are applied to him are many and diverse. I shall mention a few of them.</p>

<pb n="305"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—Concerning the Surnames of Jupiter, Which are Referred Not to Many
Gods, But to One and the Same God.</head>
<p>They have called him Victor, Invictus, Opitulus, Impulsor, Stator, Centumpeda, Supinalis,
Tigillus, Almus, Ruminus, and other names which it were long to enumerate. But these
surnames they have given to one god on account of diverse causes and powers, but yet have
not compelled him to be, on account of so many things, as many gods. They gave him these
surnames because he conquered all things; because he was conquered by none; because he
brought help to the needy; because he had the power of impelling, stopping, stablishing,
throwing on the back; because as a beam272 he held together and sustained the world; because
he nourished all things; because, like the pap,273 he nourished animals. Here, we perceive,
are some great things and some small things; and yet it is one who is said to perform them
all. I think that the causes and the beginnings of things, on account of which they have
thought that the one world is two gods, Jupiter and Janus, are nearer to each other than the
holding together of the world, and the giving of the pap to animals; and yet, on account of
these two works so far apart from each other, both in nature and dignity, there has not been
any necessity for the existence of two gods; but one Jupiter has been called, on account of
the one Tigillus, on account of the other Ruminus. I am unwilling to say that the giving of
the pap to sucking animals might have become Juno rather than Jupiter, especially when
there was the goddess Rumina to help and to serve her in this work; for I think it may be
replied that Juno herself is nothing else than Jupiter, according to those verses of Valerius
Soranus, where it has been said:
<lg>
<l>“Almighty Jove, progenitor of kings, and things, and gods,</l>
<l>And eke the mother of the gods,” etc.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Why, then, was he called Ruminus, when they who may perchance inquire more diligently
may find that he is also that goddess Rumina?</p>
<p>If, then, it was rightly thought unworthy of the majesty of the gods, that in one ear of
corn one god should have the care of the joint, another that of the husk, how much more
unworthy of that majesty is it, that one thing, and that of the lowest kind, even the giving
of the pap to animals that they may be nourished, should be under the care of two gods, one
of whom is Jupiter himself, the very king of all things, who does this not along with his own
wife, but with some ignoble Rumina (unless perhaps he himself is Rumina, being Ruminus
for males and Rumina for females)! I should certainly have said that they had been unwilling
to apply to Jupiter a feminine name, had he not been styled in these verses “progenitor and
mother,” and had I not read among other surnames of his that of Pecunia <del>money</del>, which
<note type="footnote">272 Tigillus.</note>
<note type="footnote">273 Ruma.</note>

<pb n="306"/>
we found as a goddess among those petty deities, as I have already mentioned in the fourth
book. But since both males and females have money <del>pecuniam</del>, why has he not been called
both Pecunius and Pecunia? That is their concern.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—That Jupiter is Also Called Pecunia.</head>
<p>How elegantly they have accounted for this name! “He is also called Pecunia,” say they,
“because all things belong to him.” Oh how grand an explanation of the name of a deity!
Yes; he to whom all things belong is most meanly and most contumeliously called Pecunia.
In comparison of all things which are contained by heaven and earth, what are all things
together which are possessed by men under the name of money?274 And this name, forsooth,
hath avarice given to Jupiter, that whoever was a lover of money might seem to himself to
love not an ordinary god, but the very king of all things himself. But it would be a far different
thing if he had been called Riches. For riches are one thing, money another. For we call
rich the wise, the just, the good, who have either no money or very little. For they are more
truly rich in possessing virtue, since by it, even as re spects things necessary for the body,
they are content with what they have. But we call the greedy poor, who are always craving
and always wanting. For they may possess ever so great an amount of money; but whatever
be the abundance of that, they are not able but to want. And we properly call God Himself
rich; not, however, in money, but in omnipotence. Therefore they who have abundance of
money are called rich, but inwardly needy if they are greedy. So also, those who have no
money are called poor, but inwardly rich if they are wise.</p>
<p>What, then, ought the wise man to think of this theology, in which the king of the gods
receives the name of that thing “which no wise man has desired?”275 For had there been
anything wholesomely taught by this philosophy concerning eternal life, how much more
appropriately would that god who is the ruler of the world have been called by them, not
money, but wisdom, the love of which purges from the filth of avarice, that is, of the love
of money!</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—That When It is Expounded What Saturn Is, What Genius Is, It Comes
to This, that Both of Them are Shown to Be Jupiter.</head>
<p>But why speak more of this Jupiter, with whom perchance all the rest are to be identified;
so that, he being all, the opinion as to the existence of many gods may remain as a mere
opinion, empty of all truth? And they are all to be referred to him, if his various parts and
powers are thought of as so many gods, or if the principle of mind which they think to be
diffused through all things has received the names of many gods from the various parts
which the mass of this visible world combines in itself, and from the manifold administration
of nature. For what is Saturn also? “One of the principal gods,” he says, “who has dominion
over all sowings.” Does not the exposition of the verses of Valerius Soranus teach that
Jupiter is the world, and that he emits all seeds from himself, and receives them into himself?</p>
<p>It is he, then, with whom is the dominion of all sowings. What is Genius? “He is the
god who is set over, and has the power of begetting, all things.” Who else than the world
do they believe to have this power, to which it has been said:
<lg>
<l>“Almighty Jove, progenitor and mother?”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And when in another place he says that Genius is the rational soul of every one, and
therefore exists separately in each individual, but that the corresponding soul of the world
is God, he just comes back to this same thing,—namely, that the soul of the world itself is
to be held to be, as it were, the universal genius. This, therefore, is what he calls Jupiter.
For if every genius is a god, and the soul of every man a genius, it follows that the soul of
every man is a god. But if very absurdity compels even these theologists themselves to shrink
from this, it remains that they call that genius god by special and pre-eminent distinction,
whom they call the soul of the world, and therefore Jupiter.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Concerning the Offices of Mercury and Mars.</head>
<p>But they have not found how to refer Mercury and Mars to any parts of the world, and
to the works of God which are in the elements; and therefore they have set them at least
over human works, making them assistants in speaking and in carrying on wars. Now
Mercury, if he has also the power of the speech of the gods, rules also over the king of the
gods himself, if Jupiter, as he receives from him the faculty of speech, also speaks according
as it is his pleasure to permit him—which surely is absurd; but if it is only the power over
human speech which is held to be attributed to him, then we say it is incredible that Jupiter
should have condescended to give the pap not only to children, but also to beasts—from
which he has been surnamed Ruminus—and yet should have been unwilling that the care
of our speech, by which we excel the beasts, should pertain to him. And thus speech itself
both belongs to Jupiter, and is Mercury. But if speech itself is said to be Mercury, as those
things which are said concerning him by way of interpretation show it to be;—for he is said
to have been called Mercury, that is, he who runs between,276 because speech runs between
men: they say also that the Greeks call him ῾Ερμῆς, because speech, or interpretation, which
certainly belongs to speech, is called by them ἑρμηνεία: also he is said to preside over payments,
because speech passes between sellers and buyers: the wings, too, which he has on
his head and on his feet, they say mean that speech passes winged through the air: he is also
said to have been called the messenger,277 because by means of speech all our thoughts are
expressed;278—if, therefore, speech itself is Mercury, then, even by their own confession,
he is not a god. But when they make to themselves gods of such as are not even demons,
by praying to unclean spirits, they are possessed by such as are not gods, but demons. In
like manner, because they have not been able to find for Mars any element or part of the
world in which he might perform some works of nature of whatever kind, they have said
that he is the god of war, which is a work of men, and that not one which is considered desirable
by them. If, therefore, Felicitas should give perpetual peace, Mars would have
nothing to do. But if war itself is Mars, as speech is Mercury, I wish it were as true that there
were no war to be falsely called a god, as it is true that it is not a god.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Concerning Certain Stars Which the Pagans Have Called by the Names
of Their Gods.</head>
<p>But possibly these stars which have been called by their names are these gods. For they
call a certain star Mercury, and likewise a certain other star Mars. But among those stars
which are called by the names of gods, is that one which they call Jupiter, and yet with them
Jupiter is the world. There also is that one they call Saturn, and yet they give to him no
small property besides,—namely, all seeds. There also is that brightest of them all which is
called by them Venus, and yet they will have this same Venus to be also the moon:—not to
mention how Venus and Juno are said by them to contend about that most brilliant star, as
though about another golden apple. For some say that Lucifer belongs to Venus, and some
to Juno. But, as usual, Venus conquers. For by far the greatest number assign that star to
Venus, so much so that there is scarcely found one of them who thinks otherwise. But since
they call Jupiter the king of all, who will not laugh to see his star so far surpassed in brilliancy
by the star of Venus? For it ought to have been as much more brilliant than the rest, as he
himself is more powerful. They answer that it only appears so because it is higher up, and
very much farther away from the earth. If, therefore, its greater dignity has deserved a
higher place, why is Saturn higher in the heavens than Jupiter? Was the vanity of the fable
which made Jupiter king not able to reach the stars? And has Saturn been permitted to
obtain at least in the heavens, what he could not obtain in his own kingdom nor in the
Capitol?</p>
<p>But why has Janus received no star? If it is because he is the world, and they are all in
him, the world is also Jupiter’s, and yet he has one. Did Janus compromise his case as best
he could, and instead of the one star which he does not have among the heavenly bodies,
accept so many faces on earth? Again, if they think that on account of the stars alone Mercury
and Mars are parts of the world, in order that they may be able to have them for gods, since
speech and war are not parts of the world, but acts of men, how is it that they have made
no altars, established no rites, built no temples for Aries, and Taurus, and Cancer, and
Scorpio, and the rest which they number as the celestial signs, and which consist not of
single stars, but each of them of many stars, which also they say are situated above those
already mentioned in the highest part of the heavens, where a more constant motion causes
the stars to follow an undeviating course? And why have they not reckoned them as gods,
I do not say among those select gods, but not even among those, as it were, plebeian gods?</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Concerning Apollo and Diana, and the Other Select Gods Whom They
Would Have to Be Parts of the World.</head>
<p>Although they would have Apollo to be a diviner and physician, they have nevertheless
given him a place as some part of the world. They have said that he is also the sun; and
likewise they have said that Diana, his sister, is the moon, and the guardian of roads. Whence
also they will have her be a virgin, because a road brings forth nothing. They also make
both of them have arrows, because those two planets send their rays from the heavens to
the earth. They make Vulcan to be the fire of the world; Neptune the waters of the world;
Father Dis, that is, Orcus, the earthy and lowest part of the world. Liber and Ceres they set
over seeds,—the former over the seeds of males, the latter over the seeds of females; or the
one over the fluid part of seed, but the other over the dry part. And all this together is referred
to the world, that is, to Jupiter, who is called “progenitor and mother,” because he emitted
all seeds from himself, and received them into himself. For they also make this same Ceres
to be the Great Mother, who they say is none other than the earth, and call her also Juno.
And therefore they assign to her the second causes of things, notwithstanding that it has
been said to Jupiter, “progenitor and mother of the gods;” because, according to them, the
whole world itself is Jupiter’s. Minerva, also, because they set her over human arts, and did
not find even a star in which to place her, has been said by them to be either the highest
ether, or even the moon. Also Vesta herself they have thought to be the highest of the
goddesses, because she is the earth; although they have thought that the milder fire of the
world, which is used for the ordinary purposes of human life, not the more violent fire, such
as belongs to Vulcan, is to be assigned to her. And thus they will have all those select gods
to be the world and its parts,—some of them the whole world, others of them its parts; the
whole of it Jupiter,—its parts, Genius, Mater Magna, Sol and Luna, or rather Apollo and
Diana, and so on. And sometimes they make one god many things; sometimes one thing
many gods. Many things are one god in the case of Jupiter; for both the whole world is
Jupiter, and the sky alone is Jupiter, and the star alone is said and held to be Jupiter. Juno
also is mistress of second causes,—Juno is the air, Juno is the earth; and had she won it over
Venus, Juno would have been the star. Likewise Minerva is the highest ether, and Minerva
is likewise the moon, which they suppose to be in the lowest limit of the ether. And also
they make one thing many gods in this way. The world is both Janus and Jupiter; also the
earth is Juno, and Mater Magna, and Ceres.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—That Even Varro Himself Pronounced His Own Opinions Regarding
the Gods Ambiguous.</head>
<p>And the same is true with respect to all the rest, as is true with respect to those things
which I have mentioned for the sake of example. They do not explain them, but rather involve
them. They rush hither and thither, to this side or to that, according as they are
driven by the impulse of erratic opinion; so that even Varro himself has chosen rather to
doubt concerning all things, than to affirm anything. For, having written the first of the
three last books concerning the certain gods, and having commenced in the second of these
to speak of the uncertain gods, he says: “I ought not to be censured for having stated in this
book the doubtful opinions concerning the gods. For he who, when he has read them, shall
think that they both ought to be, and can be, conclusively judged of, will do so himself. For
my own part, I can be more easily led to doubt the things which I have written in the first
book, than to attempt to reduce all the things I shall write in this one to any orderly system.”
Thus he makes uncertain not only that book concerning the uncertain gods, but also that
other concerning the certain gods. Moreover, in that third book concerning the select gods,
after having exhibited by anticipation as much of the natural theology as he deemed necessary,
and when about to commence to speak of the vanities and lying insanities of the civil theology,
where he was not only without the guidance of the truth of things, but was also pressed
by the authority of tradition, he says: “I will write in this book concerning the public gods
of the Roman people, to whom they have dedicated temples, and whom they have conspicuously
distinguished by many adornments; but, as Xenophon of Colophon writes, I will state
what I think, not what I am prepared to maintain: it is for man to think those things, for
God to know them.”</p>
<p>It is not, then, an account of things comprehended and most certainly believed which
he promised, when about to write those things which were instituted by men. He only
timidly promises an account of things which are but the subject of doubtful opinion. Nor,
indeed, was it possible for him to affirm with the same certainty that Janus was the world,
and such like things; or to discover with the same certainty such things as how Jupiter was
the son of Saturn, while Saturn was made subject to him as king:—he could, I say, neither
affirm nor discover such things with the same certainty with which he knew such things as
that the world existed, that the heavens and earth existed, the heavens bright with stars, and
the earth fertile through seeds; or with the same perfect conviction with which he believed
that this universal mass of nature is governed and administered by a certain invisible and
mighty force.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
<pb n="313"/>
<head>Chapter 18.—A More Credible Cause of the Rise of Pagan Error.</head>
<p>A far more credible account of these gods is given, when it is said that they were men,
and that to each one of them sacred rites and solemnities were instituted, according to his
particular genius, manners, actions, circumstances; which rites and solemnities, by gradually
creeping through the souls of men, which are like demons, and eager for things which yield
them sport, were spread far and wide; the poets adorning them with lies, and false spirits
seducing men to receive them. For it is far more likely that some youth, either impious
himself, or afraid of being slain by an impious father, being desirous to reign, dethroned
his father, than that (according to Varro’s interpretation) Saturn was overthrown by his son
Jupiter: for cause, which belongs to Jupiter, is before seed, which belongs to Saturn. For
had this been so, Saturn would never have been before Jupiter, nor would he have been the
father of Jupiter. For cause always precedes seed, and is never generated from seed. But
when they seek to honor by natural interpretation most vain fables or deeds of men, even
the acutest men are so perplexed that we are compelled to grieve for their folly also.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
<pb n="314"/>
<head>Chapter 19.—Concerning the Interpretations Which Compose the Reason of the
Worship of Saturn.</head>
<p>They said, says Varro, that Saturn was wont to devour all that sprang from him, because
seeds returned to the earth from whence they sprang. And when it is said that a lump of
earth was put before Saturn to be devoured instead of Jupiter, it is signified, he says, that
before the art of ploughing was discovered, seeds were buried in the earth by the hands of
men. The earth itself, then, and not seeds, should have been called Saturn, because it in a
manner devours what it has brought forth, when the seeds which have sprung from it return
again into it. And what has Saturn’s receiving of a lump of earth instead of Jupiter to do
with this, that the seeds were covered in the soil by the hands of men? Was the seed kept
from being devoured, like other things, by being covered with the soil? For what they say
would imply that he who put on the soil took away the seed, as Jupiter is said to have been
taken away when the lump of soil was offered to Saturn instead of him, and not rather that
the soil, by covering the seed, only caused it to be devoured the more eagerly. Then, in that
way, Jupiter is the seed, and not the cause of the seed, as was said a little before.</p>
<p>But what shall men do who cannot find anything wise to say, because they are interpreting
foolish things? Saturn has a pruning-knife. That, says Varro, is on account of agriculture.
Certainly in Saturn’s reign there as yet existed no agriculture, and therefore the former times
of Saturn are spoken of, because, as the same Varro interprets the fables, the primeval men
lived on those seeds which the earth produced spontaneously. Perhaps he received a pruningknife
when he had lost his sceptre; that he who had been a king, and lived at ease during the
first part of his time, should become a laborious workman whilst his son occupied the
throne. Then he says that boys were wont to be immolated to him by certain peoples, the
Carthaginians for instance; and also that adults were immolated by some nations, for example
the Gauls—because, of all seeds, the human race is the best. What need we say more concerning
this most cruel vanity. Let us rather attend to and hold by this, that these interpretations
are not carried up to the true God,—a living, incorporeal, unchangeable nature, from
whom a blessed life enduring for ever may be obtained,—but that they end in things which
are corporeal, temporal, mutable, and mortal. And whereas it is said in the fables that Saturn
castrated his father Coelus, this signifies, says Varro, that the divine seed belongs to Saturn,
and not to Coelus; for this reason, as far as a reason can be discovered, namely, that in
heaven279 nothing is born from seed. But, lo! Saturn, if he is the son of Coelus, is the son
of Jupiter. For they affirm times without number, and that emphatically, that the heavens280
are Jupiter. Thus those things which come not of the truth, do very often, without being
impelled by any one, themselves overthrow one another. He says that Saturn was called
<note type="footnote">279 Cælo.</note>
<note type="footnote">280 Cælum.</note>

<pb n="315"/>
Κρονος, which in the Greek tongue signifies a space of time,281 because, without that, seed
cannot be productive. These and many other things are said concerning Saturn, and they
are all referred to seed. But Saturn surely, with all that great power, might have sufficed for
seed. Why are other gods demanded for it, especially Liber and Libera, that is,
Ceres?—concerning whom again, as far as seed is concerned, he says as many things as if
he had said nothing concerning Saturn.</p>

<p>Now among the rites of Ceres, those Eleusinian rites are much famed which were in the
highest repute among the Athenians, of which Varro offers no interpretation except with
respect to corn, which Ceres discovered, and with respect to Proserpine, whom Ceres lost,
Orcus having carried her away. And this Proserpine herself, he says, signifies the fecundity
of seeds. But as this fecundity departed at a certain season, whilst the earth wore an aspect
of sorrow through the consequent sterility, there arose an opinion that the daughter of Ceres,
that is, fecundity itself, who was called Proserpine, from proserpere (to creep forth, to spring),
had been carried away by Orcus, and detained among the inhabitants of the nether world;
which circumstance was celebrated with public mourning. But since the same fecundity
again returned, there arose joy because Proserpine had been given back by Orcus, and thus
these rites were instituted. Then Varro adds, that many things are taught in the mysteries
of Ceres which only refer to the discovery of fruits.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21">
<pb n="317"/>
<head>Chapter 21.—Concerning the Shamefulness of the Rites Which are Celebrated in
Honor of Liber.</head>
<p>Now as to the rites of Liber, whom they have set over liquid seeds, and therefore not
only over the liquors of fruits, among which wine holds, so to speak, the primacy, but also
over the seeds of animals:—as to these rites, I am unwilling to undertake to show to what
excess of turpitude they had reached, because that would entail a lengthened discourse,
though I am not unwilling to do so as a demonstration of the proud stupidity of those who
practise them. Among other rites which I am compelled from the greatness of their number
to omit, Varro says that in Italy, at the places where roads crossed each other the rites of
Liber were celebrated with such unrestrained turpitude, that the private parts of a man were
worshipped in his honor. Nor was this abomination transacted in secret that some regard
at least might be paid to modesty, but was openly and wantonly displayed. For during the
festival of Liber this obscene member, placed on a car, was carried with great honor, first
over the crossroads in the country, and then into the city. But in the town of Lavinium a
whole month was devoted to Liber alone, during the days of which all the people gave
themselves up to the must dissolute conversation, until that member had been carried
through the forum and brought to rest in its own place; on which unseemly member it was
necessary that the most honorable matron should place a wreath in the presence of all the
people. Thus, forsooth, was the god Liber to be appeased in order to the growth of seeds.
Thus was enchantment to be driven away from fields, even by a matron’s being compelled
to do in public what not even a harlot ought to be permitted to do in a theatre, if there were
matrons among the spectators. For these reasons, then, Saturn alone was not believed to
be sufficient for seeds,—namely, that the impure mind might find occasions for multiplying
the gods; and that, being righteously abandoned to uncleanness by the one true God, and
being prostituted to the worship of many false gods, through an avidity for ever greater and
greater uncleanness, it should call these sacrilegious rites sacred things, and should abandon
itself to be violated and polluted by crowds of foul demons.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Concerning Neptune, and Salacia and Venilia.</head>
<p>Now Neptune had Salacia to wife, who they say is the nether waters of the sea. Wherefore
was Venilia also joined to him? Was it not simply through the lust of the soul desiring a
greater number of demons to whom to prostitute itself, and not because this goddess was
necessary to the perfection of their sacred rites? But let the interpretation of this illustrious
theology be brought forward to restrain us from this censuring by rendering a satisfactory
reason. Venilia, says this theology, is the wave which comes to the shore, Salacia the wave
which returns into the sea. Why, then, are there two goddesses, when it is one wave which
comes and returns? Certainly it is mad lust itself, which in its eagerness for many deities
resembles the waves which break on the shore. For though the water which goes is not different
from that which returns, still the soul which goes and returns not is defiled by two
demons, whom it has taken occasion by this false pretext to invite. I ask thee, O Varro, and
you who have read such works of learned men, and think ye have learned something great,—I
ask you to interpret this, I do not say in a manner consistent with the eternal and unchangeable
nature which alone is God, but only in a manner consistent with the doctrine concerning
the soul of the world and its parts, which ye think to be the true gods. It is a somewhat more
tolerable thing that ye have made that part of the soul of the world which pervades the sea
your god Neptune. Is the wave, then, which comes to the shore and returns to the main,
two parts of the world, or two parts of the soul of the world? Who of you is so silly as to
think so? Why, then, have they made to you two goddesses? The only reason seems to be,
that your wise ancestors have provided, not that many gods should rule you, but that many
of such demons as are delighted with those vanities and falsehoods should possess you. But
why has that Salacia, according to this interpretation, lost the lower part of the sea, seeing
that she was represented as subject to her husband? For in saying that she is the receding
wave, ye have put her on the surface. Was she enraged at her husband for taking Venilia
as a concubine, and thus drove him from the upper part of the sea?</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Concerning the Earth, Which Varro Affirms to Be a Goddess, Because
that Soul of the World Which He Thinks to Be God Pervades Also This Lowest
Part of His Body, and Imparts to It a Divine Force.</head>
<p>Surely the earth, which we see full of its own living creatures, is one; but for all that, it
is but a mighty mass among the elements, and the lowest part of the world. Why, then,
would they have it to be a goddess? Is it because it is fruitful? Why, then, are not men rather
held to be gods, who render it fruitful by cultivating it; but though they plough it, do not
adore it? But, say they, the part of the soul of the world which pervades it makes it a goddess.
As if it were not a far more evident thing, nay, a thing which is not called in question, that
there is a soul in man. And yet men are not held to be gods, but (a thing to be sadly
lamented), with wonderful and pitiful delusion, are subjected to those who are not gods,
and than whom they themselves are better, as the objects of deserved worship and adoration.
And certainly the same Varro, in the book concerning the select gods, affirms that there are
three grades of soul in universal nature. One which pervades all the living parts of the body,
and has not sensation, but only the power of life,—that principle which penetrates into the
bones, nails and hair. By this principle in the world trees are nourished, and grow without
being possessed of sensation, and live in a manner peculiar to themselves. The second grade
of soul is that in which there is sensation. This principle penetrates into the eyes, ears,
nostrils, mouth, and the organs of sensation. The third grade of soul is the highest, and is
called mind, where intelligence has its throne. This grade of soul no mortal creatures except
man are possessed of. Now this part of the soul of the world, Varro says, is called God, and
in us is called Genius. And the stones and earth in the world, which we see, and which are
not pervaded by the power of sensation, are, as it were, the bones and nails of God. Again,
the sun, moon, and stars, which we perceive, and by which He perceives, are His organs of
perception. Moreover, the ether is His mind; and by the virtue which is in it, which penetrates
into the stars, it also makes them gods; and because it penetrates through them into the
earth, it makes it the goddess Tellus, whence again it enters and permeates the sea and ocean,
making them the god Neptune.</p>
<p>Let him return from this, which he thinks to be natural theology, back to that from
which he went out, in order to rest from the fatigue occasioned by the many turnings and
windings of his path. Let him return, I say, let him return to the civil theology. I wish to
detain him there a while. I have somewhat to say which has to do with that theology. I am
not yet saying, that if the earth and stones are similar to our bones and nails, they are in like
manner devoid of intelligence, as they are devoid of sensation. Nor am I saying that, if our
bones and nails are said to have intelligence, because they are in a man who has intelligence,
he who says that the things analogous to these in the world are gods, is as stupid as he is
who says that our bones and nails are men. We shall perhaps have occasion to dispute these

<pb n="320"/>
things with the philosophers. At present, however, I wish to deal with Varro as a political
theologian. For it is possible that, though he may seem to have wished to lift up his head,
as it were, into the liberty of natural theology, the consciousness that the book with which
he was occupied was one concerning a subject belonging to civil theology, may have caused
him to relapse into the point of view of that theology, and to say this in order that the ancestors
of his nation, and other states, might not be believed to have bestowed on Neptune
an irrational worship. What I am to say is this: Since the earth is one, why has not that part
of the soul of the world which permeates the earth made it that one goddess which he calls
Tellus? But had it done so, what then had become of Orcus, the brother of Jupiter and
Neptune, whom they call Father Dis?282 And where, in that case, had been his wife
Proserpine, who, according to another opinion given in the same book, is called, not the
fecundity of the earth, but its lower part?283 But if they say that part of the soul of the world,
when it permeates the upper part of the earth, makes the god Father Dis, but when it pervades
the nether part of the same the goddess Proserpine; what, in that case, will that Tellus be?
For all that which she was has been divided into these two parts, and these two gods; so that
it is impossible to find what to make or where to place her as a third goddess, except it be
said that those divinities Orcus and Proserpine are the one goddess Tellus, and that they
are not three gods, but one or two, whilst notwithstanding they are called three, held to be
three, worshipped as three, having their own several altars, their own shrines, rites, images,
priests, whilst their own false demons also through these things defile the prostituted soul.
Let this further question be answered: What part of the earth does a part of the soul of the
world permeate in order to make the god Tellumo? No, says he; but the earth being one
and the same, has a double life,—the masculine, which produces seed, and the feminine,
which receives and nourishes the seed. Hence it has been called Tellus from the feminine
principle, and Tellumo from the masculine. Why, then, do the priests, as he indicates,
perform divine service to four gods, two others being added,—namely, to Tellus, Tellumo,
Altor, and Rusor? We have already spoken concerning Tellus and Tellumo. But why do
they worship Altor?284 Because, says he, all that springs of the earth is nourished by the
earth. Wherefore do they worship Rusor?285 Because all things return back again to the
place whence they proceeded.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Concerning the Surnames of Tellus and Their Significations, Which,
Although They Indicate Many Properties, Ought Not to Have Established the
Opinion that There is a Corresponding Number of Gods.</head>
<p>The one earth, then, on account of this fourfold virtue, ought to have had four surnames,
but not to have been considered as four gods,—as Jupiter and Juno, though they have so
many surnames, are for all that only single deities,—for by all these surnames it is signified
that a manifold virtue belongs to one god or to one goddess; but the multitude of surnames
does not imply a multitude of gods. But as sometimes even the vilest women themselves
grow tired of those crowds which they have sought after under the impulse of wicked passion,
so also the soul, become vile, and prostituted to impure spirits, sometimes begins to loathe
to multiply to itself gods to whom to surrender itself to be polluted by them, as much as it
once delighted in so doing. For Varro himself, as if ashamed of that crowd of gods, would
make Tellus to be one goddess. “They say,” says he, “that whereas the one great mother has
a tympanum, it is signified that she is the orb of the earth; whereas she has towers on her
head, towns are signified; and whereas seats are fixed round about her, it is signified that
whilst all things move, she moves not. And their having made the Galli to serve this goddess,
signifies that they who are in need of seed ought to follow the earth for in it all seeds are
found. By their throwing themselves down before her, it is taught,” he says, “that they who
cultivate the earth should not sit idle, for there is always something for them to do. The
sound of the cymbals signifies the noise made by the throwing of iron utensils, and by men’s
hands, and all other noises connected with agricultural operations; and these cymbals are
of brass, because the ancients used brazen utensils in their agriculture before iron was discovered.
They place beside the goddess an unbound and tame lion, to show that there is
no kind of land so wild and so excessively barren as that it would be profitless to attempt to
bring it in and cultivate it.” Then he adds that, because they gave many names and surnames
to mother Tellus, it came to be thought that these signified many gods. “They think,” says
he, “that Tellus is Ops, because the earth is improved by labor; Mother, because it brings
forth much; Great, because it brings forth seed; Proserpine, because fruits creep forth from
it; Vesta, because it is invested with herbs. And thus,” says he, “they not at all absurdly
identify other goddesses with the earth.” If, then, it is one goddess (though, if the truth were
consulted, it is not even that), why do they nevertheless separate it into many? Let there be
many names of one goddess, and let there not be as many goddesses as there are names.</p>
<p>But the authority of the erring ancients weighs heavily on Varro, and compels him, after
having expressed this opinion, to show signs of uneasiness; for he immediately adds, “With
which things the opinion of the ancients, who thought that there were really many goddesses,
does not conflict.” How does it not conflict, when it is entirely a different thing to say that
one goddess has many names, and to say that there are many goddesses? But it is possible,

<pb n="322"/>
he says, that the same thing may both be one, and yet have in it a plurality of things. I grant
that there are many things in one man; are there therefore in him many men? In like
manner, in one goddess there are many things; are there therefore also many goddesses?
But let them divide, unite, multiply, reduplicate, and implicate as they like.</p>
<p>These are the famous mysteries of Tellus and the Great Mother, all of which are shown
to have reference to mortal seeds and to agriculture. Do these things, then,—namely, the
tympanum, the towers, the Galli, the tossing to and fro of limbs, the noise of cymbals, the
images of lions,—do these things, having this reference and this end, promise eternal life?
Do the mutilated Galli, then, serve this Great Mother in order to signify that they who are
in need of seed should follow the earth, as though it were not rather the case that this very
service caused them to want seed? For whether do they, by following this goddess, acquire
seed, being in want of it, or, by following her, lose seed when they have it? Is this to interpret
or to deprecate? Nor is it considered to what a degree malign demons have gained the upper
hand, inasmuch as they have been able to exact such cruel rites without having dared to
promise any great things in return for them. Had the earth not been a goddess, men would
have, by laboring, laid their hands on it in order to obtain seed through it, and would not
have laid violent hands on themselves in order to lose seed on account of it. Had it not been
a goddess, it would have become so fertile by the hands of others, that it would not have
compelled a man to be rendered barren by his own hands; nor that in the festival of Liber
an honorable matron put a wreath on the private parts of a man in the sight of the multitude,
where perhaps her husband was standing by blushing and perspiring, if there is any shame
left in men; and that in the celebration of marriages the newly-married bride was ordered
to sit upon Priapus. These things are bad enough, but they are small and contemptible in
comparison with that most cruel abomination, or most abominable cruelty, by which either
set is so deluded that neither perishes of its wound. There the enchantment of fields is
feared; here the amputation of members is not feared. There the modesty of the bride is
outraged, but in such a manner as that neither her fruitfulness nor even her virginity is taken
away; here a man is so mutilated that he is neither changed into a woman nor remains a
man.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—The Interpretation of the Mutilation of Atys Which the Doctrine of
the Greek Sages Set Forth.</head>
<p>Varro has not spoken of that Atys, nor sought out any interpretation for him, in memory
of whose being loved by Ceres the Gallus is mutilated. But the learned and wise Greeks
have by no means been silent about an interpretation so holy and so illustrious. The celebrated
philosopher Porphyry has said that Atys signifies the flowers of spring, which is the
most beautiful season, and therefore was mutilated because the flower falls before the fruit
appears.286 They have not, then, compared the man himself, or rather that semblance of a
man they called Atys, to the flower, but his male organs,—these, indeed, fell whilst he was
living. Did I say fell? nay, truly they did not fall, nor were they plucked off, but torn away.
Nor when that flower was lost did any fruit follow, but rather sterility. What, then, do they
say is signified by the castrated Atys himself, and whatever remained to him after his castration?
To what do they refer that? What interpretation does that give rise to? Do they, after
vain endeavors to discover an interpretation, seek to persuade men that that is rather to be
believed which report has made public, and which has also been written concerning his
having been a mutilated man? Our Varro has very properly opposed this, and has been
unwilling to state it; for it certainly was not unknown to that most learned man.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—Concerning the Abomination of the Sacred Rites of the Great Mother.</head>
<p>Concerning the effeminates consecrated to the same Great Mother, in defiance of all
the modesty which belongs to men and women, Varro has not wished to say anything, nor
do I remember to have read anywhere aught concerning them. These effeminates, no later
than yesterday, were going through the streets and places of Carthage with anointed hair,
whitened faces, relaxed bodies, and feminine gait, exacting from the people the means of
maintaining their ignominious lives. Nothing has been said concerning them. Interpretation
failed, reason blushed, speech was silent. The Great Mother has surpassed all her sons, not
in greatness of deity, but of crime. To this monster not even the monstrosity of Janus is to
be compared. His deformity was only in his image; hers was the deformity of cruelty in her
sacred rites. He has a redundancy of members in stone images; she inflicts the loss of
members on men. This abomination is not surpassed by the licentious deeds of Jupiter, so
many and so great. He, with all his seductions of women, only disgraced heaven with one
Ganymede; she, with so many avowed and public effeminates, has both defiled the earth
and outraged heaven. Perhaps we may either compare Saturn to this Magna Mater, or even
set him before her in this kind of abominable cruelty, for he mutilated his father. But at the
festivals of Saturn, men could rather be slain by the hands of others than mutilated by their
own. He devoured his sons, as the poets say, and the natural theologists interpret this as
they list. History says he slew them. But the Romans never received, like the Carthaginians,
the custom of sacrificing their sons to him. This Great Mother of the gods, however, has
brought mutilated men into Roman temples, and has preserved that cruel custom, being
believed to promote the strength of the Romans by emasculating their men. Compared
with this evil, what are the thefts of Mercury, the wantonness of Venus, and the base and
flagitious deeds of the rest of them, which we might bring forward from books, were it not
that they are daily sung and danced in the theatres? But what are these things to so great
an evil,—an evil whose magnitude was only proportioned to the greatness of the Great
Mother,—especially as these are said to have been invented by the poets? as if the poets had
also invented this that they are acceptable to the gods. Let it be imputed, then, to the audacity
and impudence of the poets that these things have been sung and written of. But that they
have been incorporated into the body of divine rites and honors, the deities themselves demanding
and extorting that incorporation, what is that but the crime of the gods? nay more,
the confession of demons and the deception of wretched men? But as to this that the Great
Mother is considered to be worshipped in the appropriate form when she is worshipped by
the consecration of mutilated men, this is not an invention of the poets, nay, they have rather
shrunk from it with horror than sung of it. Ought any one, then, to be consecrated to these
select gods, that he may live blessedly after death, consecrated to whom he could not live
decently before death, being subjected to such foul superstitions, and bound over to unclean

<pb n="325"/>
demons? But all these things, says Varro, are to be referred to the world.287 Let him consider
if it be not rather to the unclean.288 But why not refer that to the world which is demonstrated
to be in the world? We, however, seek for a mind which, trusting to true religion,
does not adore the world as its god, but for the sake of God praises the world as a work of
God, and, purified from mundane defilements, comes pure289 to God Himself who founded
the world.290</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Concerning the Figments of the Physical Theologists, Who Neither
Worship the True Divinity, Nor Perform the Worship Wherewith the True Divinity
Should Be Served.</head>
<p>We see that these select gods have, indeed, become more famous than the rest; not,
however, that their merits may be brought to light, but that their opprobrious deeds may
not be hid. Whence it is more credible that they were men, as not only poetic but also historical
literature has handed down. For this which Virgil says,
<lg>
<l>“Then from Olympus’ heights came down</l>
<l>Good Saturn, exiled from his throne</l>
<l>By Jove, his mightier heir;”291</l>
</lg>
and what follows with reference to this affair, is fully related by the historian Euhemerus,
and has been translated into Latin by Ennius. And as they who have written before us in
the Greek or in the Latin tongue against such errors as these have said much concerning
this matter, I have thought it unnecessary to dwell upon it. When I consider those physical
reasons, then, by which learned and acute men attempt to turn human things into divine
things, all I see is that they have been able to refer these things only to temporal works and
to that which has a corporeal nature, and even though invisible still mutable; and this is by
no means the true God. But if this worship had been performed as the symbolism of ideas
at least congruous with religion, though it would indeed have been cause of grief that the
true God was not announced and proclaimed by its symbolism, nevertheless it could have
been in some degree borne with, when it did not occasion and command the performance
of such foul and abominable things. But since it is impiety to worship the body or the soul
for the true God, by whose indwelling alone the soul is happy, how much more impious is
it to worship those things through which neither soul nor body can obtain either salvation
or human honor? Wherefore if with temple, priest, and sacrifice, which are due to the true
God, any element of the world be worshipped, or any created spirit, even though not impure
and evil, that worship is still evil, not because the things are evil by which the worship is
performed, but because those things ought only to be used in the worship of Him to whom
alone such worship and service are due. But if any one insist that he worships the one true
God,—that is, the Creator of every soul and of every body,—with stupid and monstrous
idols, with human victims, with putting a wreath on the male organ, with the wages of unchastity,
with the cutting of limbs, with emasculation, with the consecration of effeminates,
with impure and obscene plays, such a one does not sin because he worships One who ought
not to be worshipped, but because he worships Him who ought to be worshipped in a way
in which He ought not to be worshipped. But he who worships with such things,—that is,
<note type="footnote">291 Virgil, Æneid, viii. 319–20.</note>

<pb n="327"/>
foul and obscene things,—and that not the true God, namely, the maker of soul and body,
but a creature, even though not a wicked creature, whether it be soul or body, or soul and
body together, twice sins against God, because he both worships for God what is not God,
and also worships with such things as neither God nor what is not God ought to be worshipped
with. It is, indeed, manifest how these pagans worship,—that is, how shamefully
and criminally they worship; but what or whom they worship would have been left in ob-
scurity, had not their history testi fied that those same confessedly base and foul rites were
rendered in obedience to the demands of the gods, who exacted them with terrible severity.
Wherefore it is evident beyond doubt that this whole civil theology is occupied in inventing
means for attracting wicked and most impure spirits, inviting them to visit senseless images,
and through these to take possession of stupid hearts.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—That the Doctrine of Varro Concerning Theology is in No Part Consistent
with Itself.</head>
<p>To what purpose, then, is it that this most learned and most acute man Varro attempts,
as it were, with subtle disputation, to reduce and refer all these gods to heaven and earth?
He cannot do it. They go out of his hands like water; they shrink back; they slip down and
fall. For when about to speak of the females, that is, the goddesses, he says, “Since, as I observed
in the first book concerning places, heaven and earth are the two origins of the gods,
on which account they are called celestials and terrestrials, and as I began in the former
books with heaven, speaking of Janus, whom some have said to be heaven, and others the
earth, so I now commence with Tellus in speaking concerning the goddesses.” I can understand
what embarrassment so great a mind was experiencing. For he is influenced by the
perception of a certain plausible resemblance, when he says that the heaven is that which
does, and the earth that which suffers, and therefore attributes the masculine principle to
the one, and the feminine to the other, not considering that it is rather He who made both
heaven and earth who is the maker of both activity and passivity. On this principle he interprets
the celebrated mysteries of the Samothracians, and promises, with an air of great devoutness,
that he will by writing expound these mysteries, which have not been so much as
known to his countrymen, and will send them his exposition. Then he says that he had
from many proofs gathered that, in those mysteries, among the images one signifies heaven,
another the earth, another the patterns of things, which Plato calls ideas. He makes Jupiter
to signify heaven, Juno the earth, Minerva the ideas. Heaven, by which anything is made;
the earth, from which it is made; and the pattern, according to which it is made. But, with
respect to the last, I am forgetting to say that Plato attributed so great an importance to these
ideas as to say, not that anything was made by heaven according to them, but that according
to them heaven itself was made.292 To return, however,—it is to be observed that Varro
has, in the book on the select gods, lost that theory of these gods, in whom he has, as it were,
embraced all things. For he assigns the male gods to heaven, the females to earth; among
which latter he has placed Minerva, whom he had before placed above heaven itself. Then
the male god Neptune is in the sea, which pertains rather to earth than to heaven. Last of
all, father Dis, who is called in Greek Πλουτων, another male god, brother of both (Jupiter
and Neptune), is also held to be a god of the earth, holding the upper region of the earth
himself, and allotting the nether region to his wife Proserpine. How, then, do they attempt
to refer the gods to heaven, and the goddesses to earth? What solidity, what consistency,
what sobriety has this disputation? But that Tellus is the origin of the goddesses,—the great
mother, to wit, beside whom there is continually the noise of the mad and abominable revelry
of effeminates and mutilated men, and men who cut themselves, and indulge in frantic
<note type="footnote">292 In the Timæus.</note>

<pb n="329"/>
gesticulations,—how is it, then, that Janus is called the head of the gods, and Tellus the head
of the goddesses? In the one case error does not make one head, and in the other frenzy
does not make a sane one. Why do they vainly attempt to refer these to the world? Even if
they could do so, no pious person worships the world for the true God. Nevertheless, plain
truth makes it evident that they are not able even to do this. Let them rather identify them
with dead men and most wicked demons, and no further question will remain.</p>

worship God,—not heaven and earth, of which two parts this world consists, nor the soul
or souls diffused through all living things,—but God who made heaven and earth, and all

<p>And now, to begin to go over those works of the one true God, on account of which
these have made to themselves many and false gods, whilst they attempt to give an honorable
interpretation to their many most abominable and most infamous mysteries,—we worship
that God who has appointed to the natures created by Him both the beginnings and the end
of their existing and moving; who holds, knows, and disposes the causes of things; who hath
created the virtue of seeds; who hath given to what creatures He would a rational soul, which
is called mind; who hath bestowed the faculty and use of speech; who hath imparted the gift
of foretelling future things to whatever spirits it seemed to Him good; who also Himself
predicts future things, through whom He pleases, and through whom He will, removes
diseases who, when the human race is to be corrected and chastised by wars, regulates also
the beginnings, progress, and ends of these wars who hath created and governs the most
vehement and most violent fire of this world, in due relation and proportion to the other
elements of immense nature; who is the governor of all the waters; who hath made the sun
brightest of all material lights, and hath given him suitable power and motion; who hath
not withdrawn, even from the inhabitants of the nether world, His dominion and power;
who hath appointed to mortal natures their suitable seed and nourishment, dry or liquid;
who establishes and makes fruitful the earth; who bountifully bestows its fruits on animals
and on men; who knows and ordains, not only principal causes, but also subsequent causes;
who hath determined for the moon her motion; who affords ways in heaven and on earth
for passage from one place to another; who hath granted also to human minds, which He
hath created, the knowledge of the various arts for the help of life and nature; who hath
appointed the union of male and female for the propagation of offspring; who hath favored
the societies of men with the gift of terrestrial fire for the simplest and most familiar purposes,
to burn on the hearth and to give light. These are, then, the things which that most acute
and most learned man Varro has labored to distribute among the select gods, by I know not
what physical interpretation, which he has got from other sources, and also conjectured for
himself. But these things the one true God makes and does, but as the same God,—that is,
as He who is wholly everywhere, included in no space, bound by no chains, mutable in no
part of His being, filling heaven and earth with omnipresent power, not with a needy nature.
Therefore He governs all things in such a manner as to allow them to perform and exercise
their own proper movements. For although they can be nothing without Him, they are not
what He is. He does also many things through angels; but only from Himself does He beatify
angels. So also, though He send angels to men for certain purposes, He does not for all that

<pb n="332"/>
beatify men by the good inherent in the angels, but by Himself, as He does the angels
themselves.</p>

with sins, averse to the contemplation of His light, and blinded by the love of darkness, that
is, of iniquity, but hath sent to us His own Word, who is His only Son, that by His birth and
suffering for us in the flesh, which He assumed, we might know how much God valued man,

afterwards dispersed through the nations, in order to testify to the scriptures in which
eternal salvation in Christ had been declared. For not only the prophecies which are contained

rejoicing in things most base and infamous, as though in divine honors, and envying human

selected as it were into the senate of the gods,—selected, however, on account of the notoriousness
of their crimes, not on account of the dignity of their virtues,—whose sacred things
Varro attempts to refer to certain natural reasons, seeking to make base things honorable,
but cannot find how to square and agree with these reasons, because these are not the causes
of those rites, which he thinks, or rather wishes to be thought to be so. For had not only
these, but also all others of this kind, been real causes, even though they had nothing to do
with the true God and eternal life, which is to be sought in religion, they would, by affording
some sort of reason drawn from the nature of things, have mitigated in some degree that
offence which was occasioned by some turpitude or absurdity in the sacred rites, which was
not understood. This he attempted to do in respect to certain fables of the theatres, or
mysteries of the shrines; but he did not acquit the theatres of likeness to the shrines, but
rather condemned the shrines for likeness to the theatres. However, he in some way made
the attempt to soothe the feelings shocked by horrible things, by rendering what he would
have to be natural interpretations.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—Concerning the Books of Numa Pompilius, Which the Senate Ordered
to Be Burned, in Order that the Causes of Sacred Rights Therein Assigned Should
Not Become Known.</head>
<p>But, on the other hand, we find, as the same most learned man has related, that the
causes of the sacred rites which were given from the books of Numa Pompilius could by no
means be tolerated, and were considered unworthy, not only to become known to the religious
by being read, but even to lie written in the darkness in which they had been concealed.
For now let me say what I promised in the third book of this work to say in its proper place.
For, as we read in the same Varro’s book on the worship of the gods, “A certain one Terentius
had a field at the Janiculum, and once, when his ploughman was passing the plough
near to the tomb of Numa Pompilius, he turned up from the ground the books of Numa,
in which were written the causes of the sacred institutions; which books he carried to the
prætor, who, having read the beginnings of them, referred to the senate what seemed to be
a matter of so much importance. And when the chief senators had read certain of the causes
why this or that rite was instituted, the senate assented to the dead Numa, and the conscript
fathers, as though concerned for the interests of religion, ordered the prætor to burn the
books.”293 Let each one believe what he thinks; nay, let every champion of such impiety
say whatever mad contention may suggest. For my part, let it suffice to suggest that the
causes of those sacred things which were written down by King Numa Pompilius, the institutor
of the Roman rites, ought never to have become known to people or senate, or even
to the priests themselves; and also that Numa him self attained to these secrets of demons
by an illicit curiosity, in order that he might write them down, so as to be able, by reading,
to be reminded of them. However, though he was king, and had no cause to be afraid of
any one, he neither dared to teach them to any one, nor to destroy them by obliteration, or
any other form of destruction. Therefore, because he was unwilling that any one should
know them, lest men should be taught infamous things, and because he was afraid to violate
them, lest he should enrage the demons against himself, he buried them in what he thought
a safe place, believing that a plough could not approach his sepulchre. But the senate, fearing
to condemn the religious solemnities of their ancestors, and therefore compelled to assent
to Numa, were nevertheless so convinced that those books were pernicious, that they did
not order them to be buried again, knowing that human curiosity would thereby be excited
to seek with far greater eagerness after the matter already divulged, but ordered the scandalous
relics to be destroyed with fire; because, as they thought it was now a necessity to perform
those sacred rites, they judged that the error arising from ignorance of their causes was more
tolerable than the disturbance which the knowledge of them would occasion the state.</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—Concerning the Hydromancy Through Which Numa Was Befooled
by Certain Images of Demons Seen in the Water.</head>
<p>For Numa himself also, to whom no prophet of God, no holy angel was sent, was driven
to have recourse to hydromancy, that he might see the images of the gods in the water (or,
rather, appearances whereby the demons made sport of him), and might learn from them
what he ought to ordain and observe in the sacred rites. This kind of divination, says Varro,
was introduced from the Persians, and was used by Numa himself, and at an after time by
the philosopher Pythagoras. In this divination, he says, they also inquire at the inhabitants
of the nether world, and make use of blood; and this the Greeks call νεκρομαντείαν. But
whether it be called necromancy or hydromancy it is the same thing, for in either case the
dead are supposed to foretell future things. But by what artifices these things are done, let
themselves consider; for I am unwilling to say that these artifices were wont to be prohibited
by the laws, and to be very severely punished even in the Gentile states, before the advent
of our Saviour. I am unwilling, I say, to affirm this, for perhaps even such things were then
allowed. However, it was by these arts that Pompilius learned those sacred rites which he
gave forth as facts, whilst he concealed their causes; for even he himself was afraid of that
which he had learned. The senate also caused the books in which those causes were recorded
to be burned. What is it, then, to me, that Varro attempts to adduce all sorts of fanciful
physical interpretations, which if these books had contained, they would certainly not have
been burned? For otherwise the conscript fathers would also have burned those books
which Varro published and dedicated to the high priest Cæsar.294 Now Numa is said to
have married the nymph Egeria, because (as Varro explains it in the forementioned book)
he carried forth295 water wherewith to perform his hydromancy. Thus facts are wont to be
converted into fables through false colorings. It was by that hydromancy, then, that that
over-curious Roman king learned both the sacred rites which were to be written in the books
of the priests, and also the causes of those rites,—which latter, however, he was unwilling
that any one besides himself should know. Wherefore he made these causes, as it were, to
die along with himself, taking care to have them written by themselves, and removed from
the knowledge of men by being buried in the earth. Wherefore the things which are written
in those books were either abominations of demons, so foul and noxious as to render that
whole civil theology execrable even in the eyes of such men as those senators, who had accepted
so many shameful things in the sacred rites themselves, or they were nothing else
than the accounts of dead men, whom, through the lapse of ages, almost all the Gentile nations
had come to believe to be immortal gods; whilst those same demons were delighted
even with such rites, having presented themselves to receive worship under pretence of being
<note type="footnote">294 Comp. Lactantius, Instit. i. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">295 Egesserit.</note>

<pb n="338"/>
those very dead men whom they had caused to be thought immortal gods by certain fallacious
miracles, performed in order to establish that belief. But, by the hidden providence of the
true God, these demons were permitted to confess these things to their friend Numa, having
been gained by those arts through which necromancy could be performed, and yet were not
constrained to admonish him rather at his death to burn than to bury the books in which
they were written. But, in order that these books might be unknown, the demons could not
resist the plough by which they were thrown up, or the pen of Varro, through which the
things which were done in reference to this matter have come down even to our knowledge.
For they are not able to effect anything which they are not allowed; but they are permitted
to influence those whom God, in His deep and just judgment, according to their deserts,
gives over either to be simply afflicted by them, or to be also subdued and deceived. But
how pernicious these writings were judged to be, or how alien from the worship of the true
Divinity, may be understood from the fact that the senate preferred to burn what Pompilius
had hid, rather than to fear what he feared, so that he could not dare to do that. Wherefore
let him who does not desire to live a pious life even now, seek eternal life by means of such
rites. But let him who does not wish to have fellowship with malign demons have no fear
for the noxious superstition wherewith they are worshipped, but let him recognize the true
religion by which they are unmasked and vanquished.</p>

<p>Argument—Augustin comes now to the third kind of theology, that is, the natural, and
takes up the question, whether the worship of the gods of the natural theology is of any avail

Platonists, because the Platonic system is “facile princeps” among philosophies, and makes
the nearest approximation to Christian truth. In pursuing this argument, he first refutes
Apuleius, and all who maintain that the demons should be worshipped as messengers and
mediators between gods and men; demonstrating that by no possibility can men be reconciled
to good gods by demons, who are the slaves of vice, and who delight in and patronize what

<head>Chapter 1.—That the Question of Natural Theology is to Be Discussed with Those
Philosophers Who Sought a More Excellent Wisdom.</head>
<p>We shall require to apply our mind with far greater intensity to the present question
than was requisite in the solution and unfolding of the questions handled in the preceding
books; for it is not with ordinary men, but with philosophers that we must confer concerning
the theology which they call natural. For it is not like the fabulous, that is, the theatrical;
nor the civil, that is, the urban theology: the one of which displays the crimes of the gods,
whilst the other manifests their criminal desires, which demonstrate them to be rather malign
demons than gods. It is, we say, with philosophers we have to confer with respect to this
theology,—men whose very name, if rendered into Latin, signifies those who profess the
love of wisdom. Now, if wisdom is God, who made all things, as is attested by the divine
authority and truth,296 then the philosopher is a lover of God. But since the thing itself,
which is called by this name, exists not in all who glory in the name,—for it does not follow,
of course, that all who are called philosophers are lovers of true wisdom,—we must needs
select from the number of those with whose opinions we have been able to acquaint ourselves
by reading, some with whom we may not unworthily engage in the treatment of this question.
For I have not in this work undertaken to refute all the vain opinions of the philosophers,
but only such as pertain to theology, which Greek word we understand to mean an account
or explanation of the divine nature. Nor, again, have I undertaken to refute all the vain
theological opinions of all the philosophers, but only of such of them as, agreeing in the
belief that there is a divine nature, and that this divine nature is concerned about human
affairs, do nevertheless deny that the worship of the one unchangeable God is sufficient for
the obtaining of a blessed life after death, as well as at the present time; and hold that, in
order to obtain that life, many gods, created, indeed, and appointed to their several spheres
by that one God, are to be worshipped. These approach nearer to the truth than even Varro;
for, whilst he saw no difficulty in extending natural theology in its entirety even to the world
and the soul of the world, these acknowledge God as existing above all that is of the nature
of soul, and as the Creator not only of this visible world, which is often called heaven and
earth, but also of every soul whatsoever, and as Him who gives blessedness to the rational
soul,—of which kind is the human soul,—by participation in His own unchangeable and
incorporeal light. There is no one, who has even a slender knowledge of these things, who
does not know of the Platonic philosophers, who derive their name from their master Plato.
Concerning this Plato, then, I will briefly state such things as I deem necessary to the present
question, mentioning beforehand those who preceded him in time in the same department
of literature.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Concerning the Two Schools of Philosophers, that Is, the Italic and
Ionic, and Their Founders.</head>
<p>As far as concerns the literature of the Greeks, whose language holds a more illustrious
place than any of the languages of the other nations, history mentions two schools of
philosophers, the one called the Italic school, originating in that part of Italy which was
formerly called Magna Græcia; the other called the Ionic school, having its origin in those
regions which are still called by the name of Greece. The Italic school had for its founder
Pythagoras of Samos, to whom also the term “philosophy” is said to owe its origin. For
whereas formerly those who seemed to excel others by the laudable manner in which they
regulated their lives were called sages, Pythagoras, on being asked what he professed, replied
that he was a philosopher, that is, a student or lover of wisdom; for it seemed to him to be
the height of arrogance to profess oneself a sage.297 The founder of the Ionic school, again,
was Thales of Miletus, one of those seven who were styled the “seven sages,” of whom six
were distinguished by the kind of life they lived, and by certain maxims which they gave
forth for the proper conduct of life. Thales was distinguished as an investigator into the
nature of things; and, in order that he might have successors in his school, he committed
his dissertations to writing. That, however, which especially rendered him eminent was his
ability, by means of astronomical calculations, even to predict eclipses of the sun and moon.
He thought, however, that water was the first principle of things, and that of it all the elements
of the world, the world itself, and all things which are generated in it, ultimately consist.
Over all this work, however, which, when we consider the world, appears so admirable, he
set nothing of the nature of divine mind. To him succeeded Anaximander, his pupil, who
held a different opinion concerning the nature of things; for he did not hold that all things
spring from one principle, as Thales did, who held that principle to be water, but thought
that each thing springs from its own proper principle. These principles of things he believed
to be infinite in number, and thought that they generated innumerable worlds, and all the
things which arise in them. He thought, also, that these worlds are subject to a perpetual
process of alternate dissolution and regeneration, each one continuing for a longer or
shorter period of time, according to the nature of the case; nor did he, any more than Thales,
attribute anything to a divine mind in the production of all this activity of things. Anaximander
left as his successor his disciple Anaximenes, who attributed all the causes of things
to an infinite air. He neither denied nor ignored the existence of gods, but, so far from believing
that the air was made by them, he held, on the contrary, that they sprang from the
air. Anaxagoras, however, who was his pupil, perceived that a divine mind was the productive
cause of all things which we see, and said that all the various kinds of things, according to
their several modes and species, were produced out of an infinite matter consisting of ho-
<note type="footnote">297 Sapiens,that is, a wise man, one who had attained to wisdom.</note>

<pb n="342"/>
mogeneous particles, but by the efficiency of a divine mind. Diogenes, also, another pupil
of Anaximenes, said that a certain air was the original substance of things out of which all
things were produced, but that it was possessed of a divine reason, without which nothing
could be produced from it. Anaxagoras was succeeded by his disciple Archelaus, who also
thought that all things consisted of homogeneous particles, of which each particular thing
was made, but that those particles were pervaded by a divine mind, which perpetually energized
all the eternal bodies, namely, those particles, so that they are alternately united and
separated. Socrates, the master of Plato, is said to have been the disciple of Archelaus; and
on Plato’s account it is that I have given this brief historical sketch of the whole history of
these schools.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="343"/>
<head>Chapter 3.—Of the Socratic Philosophy.</head>
<p>Socrates is said to have been the first who directed the entire effort of philosophy to the
correction and regulation of manners, all who went before him having expended their
greatest efforts in the investigation of physical, that is, natural phenomena. However, it
seems to me that it cannot be certainly discovered whether Socrates did this because he was
wearied of obscure and uncertain things, and so wished to direct his mind to the discovery
of something manifest and certain, which was necessary in order to the obtaining of a blessed
life,—that one great object toward which the labor, vigilance, and industry of all philosophers
seem to have been directed,—or whether (as some yet more favorable to him suppose) he
did it because he was unwilling that minds defiled with earthly desires should essay to raise
themselves upward to divine things. For he saw that the causes of things were sought for
by them,—which causes he believed to be ultimately reducible to nothing else than the will
of the one true and supreme God,—and on this account he thought they could only be
comprehended by a purified mind; and therefore that all diligence ought to be given to the
purification of the life by good morals, in order that the mind, delivered from the depressing
weight of lusts, might raise itself upward by its native vigor to eternal things, and might,
with purified understanding, contemplate that nature which is incorporeal and unchangeable
light, where live the causes of all created natures. It is evident, however, that he hunted out
and pursued, with a wonderful pleasantness of style and argument, and with a most pointed
and insinuating urbanity, the foolishness of ignorant men, who thought that they knew this
or that,—sometimes confessing his own ignorance, and sometimes dissimulating his
knowledge, even in those very moral questions to which he seems to have directed the whole
force of his mind. And hence there arose hostility against him, which ended in his being
calumniously impeached, and condemned to death. Afterwards, however, that very city of
the Athenians, which had publicly condemned him, did publicly bewail him,—the popular
indignation having turned with such vehemence on his accusers, that one of them perished
by the violence of the multitude, whilst the other only escaped a like punishment by voluntary
and perpetual exile.</p>
<p>Illustrious, therefore, both in his life and in his death, Socrates left very many disciples
of his philosophy, who vied with one another in desire for proficiency in handling those
moral questions which concern the chief good (summum bonum), the possession of which
can make a man blessed; and because, in the disputations of Socrates, where he raises all
manner of questions, makes assertions, and then demolishes them, it did not evidently appear
what he held to be the chief good, every one took from these disputations what pleased him
best, and every one placed the final good298 in whatever it appeared to himself to consist.
Now, that which is called the final good is that at which, when one has arrived, he is blessed.
<note type="footnote">298 Finem boni.</note>

<pb n="344"/>
But so diverse were the opinions held by those followers of Socrates concerning this final
good, that (a thing scarcely to be credited with respect to the followers of one master) some
placed the chief good in pleasure, as Aristippus, others in virtue, as Antisthenes. Indeed, it
were tedious to recount the various opinions of various disciples.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="345"/>
<head>Chapter 4.—Concerning Plato, the Chief Among the Disciples of Socrates, and His
Threefold Division of Philosophy.</head>
<p>But, among the disciples of Socrates, Plato was the one who shone with a glory which
far excelled that of the others, and who not unjustly eclipsed them all. By birth, an Athenian
of honorable parentage, he far surpassed his fellow-disciples in natural endowments, of
which he was possessed in a wonderful degree. Yet, deeming himself and the Socratic discipline
far from sufficient for bringing philosophy to perfection, he travelled as extensively
as he was able, going to every place famed for the cultivation of any science of which he
could make himself master. Thus he learned from the Egyptians whatever they held and
taught as important; and from Egypt, passing into those parts of Italy which were filled with
the fame of the Pythagoreans, he mastered, with the greatest facility, and under the most
eminent teachers, all the Italic philosophy which was then in vogue. And, as he had a peculiar
love for his master Socrates, he made him the speaker in all his dialogues, putting into
his mouth whatever he had learned, either from others, or from the efforts of his own
powerful intellect, tempering even his moral disputations with the grace and politeness of
the Socratic style. And, as the study of wisdom consists in action and contemplation, so
that one part of it may be called active, and the other contemplative,—the active part having
reference to the conduct of life, that is, to the regulation of morals, and the contemplative
part to the investigation into the causes of nature and into pure truth,—Socrates is said to
have excelled in the active part of that study, while Pythagoras gave more attention to its
contemplative part, on which he brought to bear all the force of his great intellect. To Plato
is given the praise of having perfected philosophy by combining both parts into one. He
then divides it into three parts,—the first moral, which is chiefly occupied with action; the
second natural, of which the object is contemplation; and the third rational, which discriminates
between the true and the false. And though this last is necessary both to action and
contemplation, it is contemplation, nevertheless, which lays peculiar claim to the office of
investigating the nature of truth. Thus this tripartite division is not contrary to that which
made the study of wisdom to consist in action and contemplation. Now, as to what Plato
thought with respect to each of these parts,—that is, what he believed to be the end of all
actions, the cause of all natures, and the light of all intelligences,—it would be a question
too long to discuss, and about which we ought not to make any rash affirmation. For, as
Plato liked and constantly affected the well-known method of his master Socrates, namely,
that of dissimulating his knowledge or his opinions, it is not easy to discover clearly what
he himself thought on various matters, any more than it is to discover what were the real
opinions of Socrates. We must, nevertheless, insert into our work certain of those opinions
which he expresses in his writings, whether he himself uttered them, or narrates them as
expressed by others, and seems himself to approve of,—opinions sometimes favorable to
the true religion, which our faith takes up and defends, and sometimes contrary to it, as, for

<pb n="346"/>
example, in the questions concerning the existence of one God or of many, as it relates to
the truly blessed life which is to be after death. For those who are praised as having most
closely followed Plato, who is justly preferred to all the other philosophers of the Gentiles,
and who are said to have manifested the greatest acuteness in understanding him, do perhaps
entertain such an idea of God as to admit that in Him are to be found the cause of existence,
the ultimate reason for the understanding, and the end in reference to which the whole life
is to be regulated. Of which three things, the first is understood to pertain to the natural,
the second to the rational, and the third to the moral part of philosophy. For if man has
been so created as to attain, through that which is most excellent in him, to that which excels
all things,—that is, to the one true and absolutely good God, without whom no nature exists,
no doctrine instructs, no exercise profits,—let Him be sought in whom all things are secure
to us, let Him be discovered in whom all truth becomes certain to us, let Him be loved in
whom all becomes right to us.</p>

<pb n="347"/>
<head>Chapter 5.—That It is Especially with the Platonists that We Must Carry on Our
Disputations on Matters of Theology, Their Opinions Being Preferable to Those
of All Other Philosophers.</head>
<p>If, then, Plato defined the wise man as one who imitates, knows, loves this God, and
who is rendered blessed through fellowship with Him in His own blessedness, why discuss
with the other philosophers? It is evident that none come nearer to us than the Platonists.
To them, therefore, let that fabulous theology give place which delights the minds of men
with the crimes of the gods; and that civil theology also, in which impure demons, under
the name of gods, have seduced the peoples of the earth given up to earthly pleasures, desiring
to be honored by the errors of men, and by filling the minds of their worshippers with impure
desires, exciting them to make the representation of their crimes one of the rites of their
worship, whilst they themselves found in the spectators of these exhibitions a most pleasing
spectacle,—a theology in which, whatever was honorable in the temple, was defiled by its
mixture with the obscenity of the theatre, and whatever was base in the theatre was vindicated
by the abominations of the temples. To these philosophers also the interpretations of Varro
must give place, in which he explains the sacred rites as having reference to heaven and
earth, and to the seeds and operations of perishable things; for, in the first place, those rites
have not the signification which he would have men believe is attached to them, and therefore
truth does not follow him in his attempt so to interpret them; and even if they had this signification,
still those things ought not to be worshipped by the rational soul as its god which
are placed below it in the scale of nature, nor ought the soul to prefer to itself as gods things
to which the true God has given it the preference. The same must be said of those writings
pertaining to the sacred rites, which Numa Pompilius took care to conceal by causing them
to be buried along with himself, and which, when they were afterwards turned up by the
plough, were burned by order of the senate. And, to treat Numa with all honor, let us
mention as belonging to the same rank as these writings that which Alexander of Macedon
wrote to his mother as communicated to him by Leo, an Egyptian high priest. In this letter
not only Picus and Faunus, and Æneas and Romulus or even Hercules, and Æsculapius and
Liber, born of Semele, and the twin sons of Tyndareus, or any other mortals who have been
deified, but even the principal gods themselves,299 to whom Cicero, in his Tusculan questions,
300 alludes without mentioning their names, Jupiter, Juno, Saturn, Vulcan, Vesta, and
many others whom Varro attempts to identify with the parts or the elements of the world,
<note type="footnote">299 Dii majorum gentium.</note>
<note type="footnote">300 Book i. 13.</note>

<pb n="348"/>
are shown to have been men. There is, as we have said, a similarity between this case and
that of Numa; for the priest being afraid because he had revealed a mystery, earnestly begged
of Alexander to command his mother to burn the letter which conveyed these communications
to her. Let these two theologies, then, the fabulous and the civil, give place to the
Platonic philosophers, who have recognized the true God as the author of all things, the
source of the light of truth, and the bountiful bestower of all blessedness. And not these
only, but to these great acknowledgers of so great a God, those philosophers must yield who,
having their mind enslaved to their body, supposed the principles of all things to be material;
as Thales, who held that the first principle of all things was water; Anaximenes, that it
was air; the Stoics, that it was fire; Epicurus, who affirmed that it consisted of atoms, that is
to say, of minute corpuscules; and many others whom it is needless to enumerate, but who
believed that bodies, simple or compound, animate or inanimate, but nevertheless bodies,
were the cause and principle of all things. For some of them—as, for instance, the Epicureans—
believed that living things could originate from things without life; others held that
all things living or without life spring from a living principle, but that, nevertheless, all
things, being material, spring from a material principle. For the Stoics thought that fire,
that is, one of the four material elements of which this visible world is composed, was both
living and intelligent, the maker of the world and of all things contained in it,—that it was
in fact God. These and others like them have only been able to suppose that which their
hearts enslaved to sense have vainly suggested to them. And yet they have within themselves
something which they could not see: they represented to themselves inwardly things which
they had seen without, even when they were not seeing them, but only thinking of them.
But this representation in thought is no longer a body, but only the similitude of a body;
and that faculty of the mind by which this similitude of a body is seen is neither a body nor
the similitude of a body; and the faculty which judges whether the representation is beautiful
or ugly is without doubt superior to the object judged of. This principle is the understanding
of man, the rational soul; and it is certainly not a body, since that similitude of a body which
it beholds and judges of is itself not a body. The soul is neither earth, nor water, nor air,
nor fire, of which four bodies, called the four elements, we see that this world is composed.
And if the soul is not a body, how should God, its Creator, be a body? Let all those philosophers,
then, give place, as we have said, to the Platonists, and those also who have been
ashamed to say that God is a body, but yet have thought that our souls are of the same nature
as God. They have not been staggered by the great changeableness of the soul,—an attribute
which it would be impious to ascribe to the divine nature,—but they say it is the body which
changes the soul, for in itself it is unchangeable. As well might they say, “Flesh is wounded
by some body, for in itself it is invulnerable.” In a word, that which is unchangeable can be
changed by nothing, so that that which can be changed by the body cannot properly be said
to be immutable.</p>

and glory, have seen that no material body is God, and therefore they have transcended all
bodies in seeking for God. They have seen that whatever is changeable is not the most high
God, and therefore they have transcended every soul and all changeable spirits in seeking
the supreme. They have seen also that, in every changeable thing, the form which makes it
that which it is, whatever be its mode or nature, can only be through Him who truly is, because
He is unchangeable. And therefore, whether we consider the whole body of the world,
its figure, qualities, and orderly movement, and also all the bodies which are in it; or
whether we consider all life, either that which nourishes and maintains, as the life of trees,
or that which, besides this, has also sensation, as the life of beasts; or that which adds to all
these intelligence, as the life of man; or that which does not need the support of nutriment,
but only maintains, feels, understands, as the life of angels,—all can only be through Him
who absolutely is. For to Him it is not one thing to be, and another to live, as though He
could be, not living; nor is it to Him one thing to live, and another thing to understand, as
though He could live, not understanding; nor is it to Him one thing to understand, another
thing to be blessed, as though He could understand and not be blessed. But to Him to live,
to understand, to be blessed, are to be. They have understood, from this unchangeableness
and this simplicity, that all things must have been made by Him, and that He could Himself
have been made by none. For they have considered that whatever is is either body or life,
and that life is something better than body, and that the nature of body is sensible, and that
of life intelligible. Therefore they have preferred the intelligible nature to the sensible. We
mean by sensible things such things as can be perceived by the sight and touch of the body;
by intelligible things, such as can be understood by the sight of the mind. For there is no
corporeal beauty, whether in the condition of a body, as figure, or in its movement, as in
music, of which it is not the mind that judges. But this could never have been, had there
not existed in the mind itself a superior form of these things, without bulk, without noise
of voice, without space and time. But even in respect of these things, had the mind not been
mutable, it would not have been possible for one to judge better than another with regard
to sensible forms. He who is clever, judges better than he who is slow, he who is skilled than
he who is unskillful, he who is practised than he who is unpractised; and the same person
judges better after he has gained experience than he did before. But that which is capable
of more and less is mutable; whence able men, who have thought deeply on these things,
have gathered that the first form is not to be found in those things whose form is changeable.
Since, therefore, they saw that body and mind might be more or less beautiful in form, and
that, if they wanted form, they could have no existence, they saw that there is some existence
in which is the first form, unchangeable, and therefore not admitting of degrees of compar-

<pb n="350"/>
ison, and in that they most rightly believed was the first principle of things which was not
made, and by which all things were made. Therefore that which is known of God He
manifested to them when His invisible things were seen by them, being understood by those
things which have been made; also His eternal power and Godhead by whom all visible and
temporal things have been created.301 We have said enough upon that part of theology
which they call physical, that is, natural.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—How Much the Platonists are to Be Held as Excelling Other Philosophers
in Logic, i.e. Rational Philosophy.</head>
<p>Then, again, as far as regards the doctrine which treats of that which they call logic, that
is, rational philosophy, far be it from us to compare them with those who attributed to the
bodily senses the faculty of discriminating truth, and thought, that all we learn is to be
measured by their untrustworthy and fallacious rules. Such were the Epicureans, and all of
the same school. Such also were the Stoics, who ascribed to the bodily senses that expertness
in disputation which they so ardently love, called by them dialectic, asserting that from the
senses the mind conceives the notions (ἒννοιαι) of those things which they explicate by
definition. And hence is developed the whole plan and connection of their learning and
teaching. I often wonder, with respect to this, how they can say that none are beautiful but
the wise; for by what bodily sense have they perceived that beauty, by what eyes of the flesh
have they seen wisdom’s comeliness of form? Those, however, whom we justly rank before
all others, have distinguished those things which are conceived by the mind from those
which are perceived by the senses, neither taking away from the senses anything to which
they are competent, nor attributing to them anything beyond their competency. And the
light of our understandings, by which all things are learned by us, they have affirmed to be
that selfsame God by whom all things were made.</p>

<pb n="352"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—That the Platonists Hold the First Rank in Moral Philosophy Also.</head>
<p>The remaining part of philosophy is morals, or what is called by the Greeks ἠθική, in
which is discussed the question concerning the chief good,—that which will leave us nothing
further to seek in order to be blessed, if only we make all our actions refer to it, and seek it
not for the sake of something else, but for its own sake. Therefore it is called the end, because
we wish other things on account of it, but itself only for its own sake. This beatific good,
therefore, according to some, comes to a man from the body, according to others, from the
mind, and, according to others, from both together. For they saw that man himself consists
of soul and body; and therefore they believed that from either of these two, or from both
together, their well-being must proceed, consisting in a certain final good, which could
render them blessed, and to which they might refer all their actions, not requiring anything
ulterior to which to refer that good itself. This is why those who have added a third kind
of good things, which they call extrinsic,—as honor, glory, wealth, and the like,—have not
regarded them as part of the final good, that is, to be sought after for their own sake, but as
things which are to be sought for the sake of something else, affirming that this kind of good
is good to the good, and evil to the evil. Wherefore, whether they have sought the good of
man from the mind or from the body, or from both together, it is still only from man they
have supposed that it must be sought. But they who have sought it from the body have
sought it from the inferior part of man; they who have sought it from the mind, from the
superior part; and they who have sought it from both, from the whole man. Whether
therefore, they have sought it from any part, or from the whole man, still they have only
sought it from man; nor have these differences, being three, given rise only to three dissentient
sects of philosophers, but to many. For diverse philosophers have held diverse opinions,
both concerning the good of the body, and the good of the mind, and the good of both together.
Let, therefore, all these give place to those philosophers who have not affirmed that
a man is blessed by the enjoyment of the body, or by the enjoyment of the mind, but by the
enjoyment of God,—enjoying Him, however, not as the mind does the body or itself, or as
one friend enjoys another, but as the eye enjoys light, if, indeed, we may draw any comparison
between these things. But what the nature of this comparison is, will, if God help me,
be shown in another place, to the best of my ability. At present, it is sufficient to mention
that Plato determined the final good to be to live according to virtue, and affirmed that he
only can attain to virtue who knows and imitates God,—which knowledge and imitation
are the only cause of blessedness. Therefore he did not doubt that to philosophize is to love
God, whose nature is incorporeal. Whence it certainly follows that the student of wisdom,
that is, the philosopher, will then become blessed when he shall have begun to enjoy God.
For though he is not necessarily blessed who enjoys that which he loves (for many are
miserable by loving that which ought not to be loved, and still more miserable when they
enjoy it), nevertheless no one is blessed who does not enjoy that which he loves. For even

<pb n="353"/>
they who love things which ought not to be loved do not count themselves blessed by loving
merely, but by enjoying them. Who, then, but the most miserable will deny that he is blessed,
who enjoys that which he loves, and loves the true and highest good? But the true and
highest good, according to Plato, is God, and therefore he would call him a philosopher
who loves God; for philosophy is directed to the obtaining of the blessed life, and he who
loves God is blessed in the enjoyment of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—That the Excellency of the Christian Religion is Above All the Science
of Philosophers.</head>
<p>For although a Christian man instructed only in ecclesiastical literature may perhaps
be ignorant of the very name of Platonists, and may not even know that there have existed
two schools of philosophers speaking the Greek tongue, to wit, the Ionic and Italic, he is
nevertheless not so deaf with respect to human affairs, as not to know that philosophers
profess the study, and even the possession, of wisdom. He is on his guard, however, with
respect to those who philosophize according to the elements of this world, not according
to God, by whom the world itself was made; for he is warned by the precept of the apostle,
and faithfully hears what has been said, “Beware that no one deceive you through philosophy
and vain deceit, according to the elements of the world.”302 Then, that he may not suppose
that all philosophers are such as do this, he hears the same apostle say concerning certain
of them, “Because that which is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested
it to them. For His invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen,
being understood by the things which are made, also His eternal power and Godhead.”303
And, when speaking to the Athenians, after having spoken a mighty thing concerning God,
which few are able to understand, “In Him we live, and move, and have our being,”304 he
goes on to say, “As certain also of your own have said.” He knows well, too, to be on his
guard against even these philosophers in their errors. For where it has been said by him,
“that God has manifested to them by those things which are made His invisible things, that
they might be seen by the understanding,” there it has also been said that they did not rightly
worship God Himself, because they paid divine honors, which are due to Him alone, to
other things also to which they ought not to have paid them,—“because, knowing God, they
glorified Him not as God: neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations,
and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of corruptible
man, and of birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things;”305—where the apostle would
have us understand him as meaning the Romans, and Greeks, and Egyptians, who gloried
in the name of wisdom; but concerning this we will dispute with them afterwards. With
respect, however, to that wherein they agree with us we prefer them to all others namely,
concerning the one God, the author of this universe, who is not only above every body, being
incorporeal, but also above all souls, being incorruptible—our principle, our light, our good.

words which he has not learned,—not calling that part of philosophy natural (which is the
Latin term), or physical (which is the Greek one), which treats of the investigation of nature;
or that part rational, or logical, which deals with the question how truth may be discovered;
or that part moral, or ethical, which concerns morals, and shows how good is to be sought,
and evil to be shunned,—he is not, therefore, ignorant that it is from the one true and supremely
good God that we have that nature in which we are made in the image of God, and
that doctrine by which we know Him and ourselves, and that grace through which, by
cleaving to Him, we are blessed. This, therefore, is the cause why we prefer these to all the
others, because, whilst other philosophers have worn out their minds and powers in seeking
the causes of things, and endeavoring to discover the right mode of learning and of living,
these, by knowing God, have found where resides the cause by which the universe has been
constituted, and the light by which truth is to be discovered, and the fountain at which felicity
is to be drunk. All philosophers, then, who have had these thoughts concerning God,
whether Platonists or others, agree with us. But we have thought it better to plead our cause
with the Platonists, because their writings are better known. For the Greeks, whose tongue
holds the highest place among the languages of the Gentiles, are loud in their praises of
these writings; and the Latins, taken with their excellence, or their renown, have studied
them more heartily than other writings, and, by translating them into our tongue, have
given them greater celebrity and notoriety.</p>

<pb n="357"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—How Plato Has Been Able to Approach So Nearly to Christian
Knowledge.</head>
<p>Certain partakers with us in the grace of Christ, wonder when they hear and read that
Plato had conceptions concerning God, in which they recognize considerable agreement
with the truth of our religion. Some have concluded from this, that when he went to Egypt
he had heard the prophet Jeremiah, or, whilst travelling in the same country, had read the
prophetic scriptures, which opinion I myself have expressed in certain of my writings.306
But a careful calculation of dates, contained in chronological history, shows that Plato was
born about a hundred years after the time in which Jeremiah prophesied, and, as he lived
eighty-one years, there are found to have been about seventy years from his death to that
time when Ptolemy, king of Egypt, requested the prophetic scriptures of the Hebrew people
to be sent to him from Judea, and committed them to seventy Hebrews, who also knew the
Greek tongue, to be translated and kept. Therefore, on that voyage of his, Plato could neither
have seen Jeremiah, who was dead so long before, nor have read those same scriptures which
had not yet been translated into the Greek language, of which he was a master, unless, indeed,
we say that, as he was most earnest in the pursuit of knowledge, he also studied those writings
through an interpreter, as he did those of the Egyptians,—not, indeed, writing a translation
of them (the facilities for doing which were only gained even by Ptolemy in return for munificent
acts of kindness,307 though fear of his kingly authority might have seemed a sufficient
motive), but learning as much as he possibly could concerning their contents by means of
conversation. What warrants this supposition are the opening verses of Genesis: “In the
beginning God made the heaven and earth. And the earth was invisible, and without order;
and darkness was over the abyss: and the Spirit of God moved over the waters.”308 For in
the Timæus, when writing on the formation of the world, he says that God first united earth
and fire; from which it is evident that he assigns to fire a place in heaven. This opinion bears
a certain resemblance to the statement, “In the beginning God made heaven and earth.”
Plato next speaks of those two intermediary elements, water and air, by which the other two
extremes, namely, earth and fire, were mutually united; from which circumstance he is
thought to have so understood the words, “The Spirit of God moved over the waters.” For,
not paying sufficient attention to the designations given by those scriptures to the Spirit of
God, he may have thought that the four elements are spoken of in that place, because the
air also is called spirit.309 Then, as to Plato’s saying that the philosopher is a lover of God,
nothing shines forth more conspicuously in those sacred writings. But the most striking

<pb n="358"/>
thing in this connection, and that which most of all inclines me almost to assent to the
opinion that Plato was not ignorant of those writings, is the answer which was given to the
question elicited from the holy Moses when the words of God were conveyed to him by the
angel; for, when he asked what was the name of that God who was commanding him to go
and deliver the Hebrew people out of Egypt, this answer was given: “I am who am; and
thou shalt say to the children of Israel, He who is sent me unto you;”310 as though compared
with Him that truly is, because He is unchangeable, those things which have been created
mutable are not,—a truth which Plato zealously held, and most diligently commended.
And I know not whether this sentiment is anywhere to be found in the books of those who
were before Plato, unless in that book where it is said, “I am who am; and thou shalt say to
the children of Israel, who is sent me unto you.”</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—That Even the Platonists, Though They Say These Things Concerning
the One True God, Nevertheless Thought that Sacred Rites Were to Be Performed
in Honor of Many Gods.</head>
<p>But we need not determine from what source he learned these things,—whether it was
from the books of the ancients who preceded him, or, as is more likely, from the words of
the apostle: “Because that which is known of God, has been manifested among them, for
God hath manifested it to them. For His invisible things from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by those things which have been made, also His eternal power
and Godhead.”311 From whatever source he may have derived this knowledge, then, I think
I have made it sufficiently plain that I have not chosen the Platonic philosophers undeservedly
as the parties with whom to discuss; because the question we have just taken up concerns
the natural theology,—the question, namely, whether sacred rites are to be performed to
one God, or to many, for the sake of the happiness which is to be after death. I have specially
chosen them because their juster thoughts concerning the one God who made heaven and
earth, have made them illustrious among philosophers. This has given them such superiority
to all others in the judgment of posterity, that, though Aristotle, the disciple of Plato, a man
of eminent abilities, inferior in eloquence to Plato, yet far superior to many in that respect,
had founded the Peripatetic sect,—so called because they were in the habit of walking about
during their disputations,—and though he had, through the greatness of his fame, gathered
very many disciples into his school, even during the life of his master; and though Plato at
his death was succeeded in his school, which was called the Academy, by Speusippus, his
sister’s son, and Xenocrates, his beloved disciple, who, together with their successors, were
called from this name of the school, Academics; nevertheless the most illustrious recent
philosophers, who have chosen to follow Plato, have been unwilling to be called Peripatetics,
or Academics, but have preferred the name of Platonists. Among these were the renowned
Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, who were Greeks, and the African Apuleius, who was
learned both in the Greek and Latin tongues. All these, however, and the rest who were of
the same school, and also Plato himself, thought that sacred rites ought to be performed in
honor of many gods.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Concerning the Opinion of Plato, According to Which He Defined
the Gods as Beings Entirely Good and the Friends of Virtue.</head>
<p>Therefore, although in many other important respects they differ from us, nevertheless
with respect to this particular point of difference, which I have just stated, as it is one of
great moment, and the question on hand concerns it, I will first ask them to what gods they
think that sacred rites are to be performed,—to the good or to the bad, or to both the good
and the bad? But we have the opinion of Plato affirming that all the gods are good, and that
there is not one of the gods bad. It follows, therefore, that these are to be performed to the
good, for then they are performed to gods; for if they are not good, neither are they gods.
Now, if this be the case (for what else ought we to believe concerning the gods?), certainly
it explodes the opinion that the bad gods are to be propitiated by sacred rites in order that
they may not harm us, but the good gods are to be invoked in order that they may assist us.
For there are no bad gods, and it is to the good that, as they say, the due honor of such rites
is to be paid. Of what character, then, are those gods who love scenic displays, even demanding
that a place be given them among divine things, and that they be exhibited in their
honor? The power of these gods proves that they exist, but their liking such things proves
that they are bad. For it is well-known what Plato’s opinion was concerning scenic plays.
He thinks that the poets themselves, because they have composed songs so unworthy of the
majesty and goodness of the gods, ought to be banished from the state. Of what character,
therefore, are those gods who contend with Plato himself about those scenic plays? He does
not suffer the gods to be defamed by false crimes; the gods command those same crimes to
be celebrated in their own honor.</p>
<p>In fine, when they ordered these plays to be inaugurated, they not only demanded base
things, but also did cruel things, taking from Titus Latinius his son, and sending a disease
upon him because he had refused to obey them, which they removed when he had fulfilled
their commands. Plato, however, bad though they were, did not think they were to be feared;
but, holding to his opinion with the utmost firmness and constancy, does not hesitate to
remove from a well-ordered state all the sacrilegious follies of the poets, with which these
gods are delighted because they themselves are impure. But Labeo places this same Plato
(as I have mentioned already in the second book312) among the demi-gods. Now Labeo
thinks that the bad deities are to be propitiated with bloody victims, and by fasts accompanied
with the same, but the good deities with plays, and all other things which are associated with
joyfulness. How comes it, then, that the demi-god Plato so persistently dares to take away
those pleasures, because he deems them base, not from the demi-gods but from the gods,
and these the good gods? And, moreover, those very gods themselves do certainly refute
the opinion of Labeo, for they showed themselves in the case of Latinius to be not only
<note type="footnote">312 Ch. 14.</note>

<pb n="361"/>
wanton and sportive, but also cruel and terrible. Let the Platonists, therefore, explain these
things to us, since, following the opinion of their master, they think that all the gods are
good and honorable, and friendly to the virtues of the wise, holding it unlawful to think
otherwise concerning any of the gods. We will explain it, say they. Let us then attentively
listen to them.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Opinion of Those Who Have Said that Rational Souls are of
Three Kinds, to Wit, Those of the Celestial Gods, Those of the Aerial Demons,
and Those of Terrestrial Men.</head>
<p>There is, say they, a threefold division of all animals endowed with a rational soul,
namely, into gods, men, and demons. The gods occupy the loftiest region, men the lowest,
the demons the middle region. For the abode of the gods is heaven, that of men the earth,
that of the demons the air. As the dignity of their regions is diverse, so also is that of their
natures; therefore the gods are better than men and demons. Men have been placed below
the gods and demons, both in respect of the order of the regions they inhabit, and the difference
of their merits. The demons, therefore, who hold the middle place, as they are inferior
to the gods, than whom they inhabit a lower region, so they are superior to men, than whom
they inhabit a loftier one. For they have immortality of body in common with the gods, but
passions of the mind in common with men. On which account, say they, it is not wonderful
that they are delighted with the obscenities of the theatre, and the fictions of the poets, since
they are also subject to human passions, from which the gods are far removed, and to which
they are altogether strangers. Whence we conclude that it was not the gods, who are all
good and highly exalted, that Plato deprived of the pleasure of theatric plays, by reprobating
and prohibiting the fictions of the poets, but the demons.</p>
<p>Of these things many have written: among others Apuleius, the Platonist of Madaura,
who composed a whole work on the subject, entitled, Concerning the God of Socrates. He
there discusses and explains of what kind that deity was who attended on Socrates, a sort
of familiar, by whom it is said he was admon ished to desist from any action which would
not turn out to his advantage. He asserts most distinctly, and proves at great length, that it
was not a god but a demon; and he discusses with great diligence the opinion of Plato concerning
the lofty estate of the gods, the lowly estate of men, and the middle estate of demons.
These things being so, how did Plato dare to take away, if not from the gods, whom he removed
from all human contagion, certainly from the demons, all the pleasures of the theatre,
by expelling the poets from the state? Evidently in this way he wished to admonish the human
soul, although still confined in these moribund members, to despise the shameful commands
of the demons, and to detest their impurity, and to choose rather the splendor of virtue.
But if Plato showed himself virtuous in answering and prohibiting these things, then certainly
it was shameful of the demons to command them. Therefore either Apuleius is wrong, and
Socrates’ familiar did not belong to this class of deities, or Plato held contradictory opinions,
now honoring the demons, now removing from the well-regulated state the things in which
they delighted, or Socrates is not to be congratulated on the friendship of the demon, of
which Apuleius was so ashamed that he entitled his book On the God of Socrates, whilst according
to the tenor of his discussion, wherein he so diligently and at such length distin-

<pb n="363"/>
guishes gods from demons, he ought not to have entitled it, Concerning the God, but Concerning
the Demon of Socrates. But he preferred to put this into the discussion itself rather
than into the title of his book. For, through the sound doctrine which has illuminated human
society, all, or almost all men have such a horror at the name of demons, that every one who
before reading the dissertation of Apuleius, which sets forth the dignity of demons, should
have read the title of the book, On the Demon of Socrates, would certainly have thought that
the author was not a sane man. But what did even Apuleius find to praise in the demons,
except subtlety and strength of body and a higher place of habitation? For when he spoke
generally concerning their manners, he said nothing that was good, but very much that was
bad. Finally, no one, when he has read that book, wonders that they desired to have even
the obscenity of the stage among divine things, or that, wishing to be thought gods, they
should be delighted with the crimes of the gods, or that all those sacred solemnities, whose
obscenity occasions laughter, and whose shameful cruelty causes horror, should be in
agreement with their passions.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—That the Demons are Not Better Than Men Because of Their Aerial
Bodies, or on Account of Their Superior Place of Abode.</head>
<p>Wherefore let not the mind truly religious, and submitted to the true God, suppose that
demons are better than men, because they have better bodies. Otherwise it must put many
beasts before itself which are superior to us both in acuteness of the senses, in ease and
quickness of movement, in strength and in long-continued vigor of body. What man can
equal the eagle or the vulture in strength of vision? Who can equal the dog in acuteness of
smell? Who can equal the hare, the stag, and all the birds in swiftness? Who can equal in
strength the lion or the elephant? Who can equal in length of life the serpents, which are
affirmed to put off old age along with their skin, and to return to youth again? But as we
are better than all these by the possession of reason and understanding, so we ought also to
be better than the demons by living good and virtuous lives. For divine providence gave to
them bodies of a better quality than ours, that that in which we excel them might in this
way be commended to us as deserving to be far more cared for than the body, and that we
should learn to despise the bodily excellence of the demons compared with goodness of life,
in respect of which we are better than they, knowing that we too shall have immortality of
body,—not an immortality tortured by eternal punishment, but that which is consequent
on purity of soul.</p>
<p>But now, as regards loftiness of place, it is altogether ridiculous to be so influenced by
the fact that the demons inhabit the air, and we the earth, as to think that on that account
they are to be put before us; for in this way we put all the birds before ourselves. But the
birds, when they are weary with flying, or require to repair their bodies with food, come
back to the earth to rest or to feed, which the demons, they say, do not. Are they, therefore,
inclined to say that the birds are superior to us, and the demons superior to the birds? But
if it be madness to think so, there is no reason why we should think that, on account of their
inhabiting a loftier element, the demons have a claim to our religious submission. But as
it is really the case that the birds of the air are not only not put before us who dwell on the
earth; but are even subjected to us on account of the dignity of the rational soul which is in
us, so also it is the case that the demons, though they are aerial, are not better than we who
are terrestrial because the air is higher than the earth, but, on the contrary, men are to be
put before demons because their despair is not to be compared to the hope of pious men.
Even that law of Plato’s, according to which he mutually orders and arranges the four elements,
inserting between the two extreme elements—namely, fire, which is in the highest
degree mobile, and the immoveable earth—the two middle ones, air and water, that by how
much the air is higher up than the water, and the fire than the air, by so much also are the
waters higher than the earth,—this law, I say, sufficiently admonishes us not to estimate the
merits of animated creatures according to the grades of the elements. And Apuleius himself
says that man is a terrestrial animal in common with the rest, who is nevertheless to be put

<pb n="365"/>
far before aquatic animals, though Plato puts the waters themselves before the land. By this
he would have us understand that the same order is not to be observed when the question
concerns the merits of animals, though it seems to be the true one in the gradation of bodies;
for it appears to be possible that a soul of a higher order may inhabit a body of a lower, and
a soul of a lower order a body of a higher.</p>

<pb n="366"/>
<head>Chapter 16.—What Apuleius the Platonist Thought Concerning the Manners and
Actions of Demons.</head>
<p>The same Apuleius, when speaking concerning the manners of demons, said that they
are agitated with the same perturbations of mind as men; that they are provoked by injuries,
propitiated by services and by gifts, rejoice in honors, are delighted with a variety of sacred
rites, and are annoyed if any of them be neglected. Among other things, he also says that
on them depend the divinations of augurs, soothsayers, and prophets, and the revelations
of dreams, and that from them also are the miracles of the magicians. But, when giving a
brief definition of them, he says, “Demons are of an animal nature, passive in soul, rational
in mind, aerial in body, eternal in time.” “Of which five things, the three first are common
to them and us, the fourth peculiar to themselves, and the fifth common to therewith the
gods.”313 But I see that they have in common with the gods two of the first things, which
they have in common with us. For he says that the gods also are animals; and when he is
assigning to every order of beings its own element, he places us among the other terrestrial
animals which live and feel upon the earth. Wherefore, if the demons are animals as to
genus, this is common to them, not only with men, but also with the gods and with beasts;
if they are rational as to their mind, this is common to them with the gods and with men;
if they are eternal in time, this is common to them with the gods only; if they are passive as
to their soul, this is common to them with men only; if they are aerial in body, in this they
are alone. Therefore it is no great thing for them to be of an animal nature, for so also are
the beasts; in being rational as to mind, they are not above ourselves, for so are we also; and
as to their being eternal as to time, what is the advantage of that if they are not blessed? for
better is temporal happiness than eternal misery. Again, as to their being passive in soul,
how are they in this respect above us, since we also are so, but would not have been so had
we not been miserable? Also, as to their being aerial in body, how much value is to be set
on that, since a soul of any kind whatsoever is to be set above every body? and therefore
religious worship, which ought to be rendered from the soul, is by no means due to that
thing which is inferior to the soul. Moreover, if he had, among those things which he says
belong to demons, enumerated virtue, wisdom, happiness, and affirmed that they have those
things in common with the gods, and, like them, eternally, he would assuredly have attributed
to them something greatly to be desired, and much to be prized. And even in that case it
would not have been our duty to worship them like God on account of these things, but
rather to worship Him from whom we know they had received them. But how much less
are they really worthy of divine honor,—those aerial animals who are only rational that they
may be capable of misery, passive that they may be actually miserable, and eternal that it
may be impossible for them to end their misery!</p>

<pb n="367"/>
<head>Chapter 17.—Whether It is Proper that Men Should Worship Those Spirits from
Whose Vices It is Necessary that They Be Freed.</head>
<p>Wherefore, to omit other things, and confine our attention to that which he says is
common to the demons with us, let us ask this question: If all the four elements are full of
their own animals, the fire and the air of immortal, and the water and the earth of mortal
ones, why are the souls of demons agitated by the whirlwinds and tempests of passions?—for
the Greek word παθος means perturbation, whence he chose to call the demons “passive in
soul,” because the word passion, which is derived from πάθος, signified a commotion of
the mind contrary to reason. Why, then, are these things in the minds of demons which
are not in beasts? For if anything of this kind appears in beasts, it is not perturbation, because
it is not contrary to reason, of which they are devoid. Now it is foolishness or misery which
is the cause of these perturbations in the case of men, for we are not yet blessed in the possession
of that perfection of wisdom which is promised to us at last, when we shall be set
free from our present mortality. But the gods, they say, are free from these perturbations,
because they are not only eternal, but also blessed; for they also have the same kind of rational
souls, but most pure from all spot and plague. Wherefore, if the gods are free from perturbation
because they are blessed, not miserable animals, and the beasts are free from them
because they are animals which are capable neither of blessedness nor misery, it remains
that the demons, like men, are subject to perturbations because they are not blessed but
miserable animals. What folly, therefore, or rather what madness, to submit ourselves
through any sentiment of religion to demons, when it belongs to the true religion to deliver
us from that depravity which makes us like to them! For Apuleius himself, although he is
very sparing toward them, and thinks they are worthy of divine honors, is nevertheless
compelled to confess that they are subject to anger; and the true religion commands us not
to be moved with anger, but rather to resist it. The demons are won over by gifts; and the
true religion commands us to favor no one on account of gifts received. The demons are
flattered by honors; but the true religion commands us by no means to be moved by such
things. The demons are haters of some men and lovers of others, not in consequence of a
prudent and calm judgment, but because of what he calls their “passive soul;” whereas the
true religion commands us to love even our enemies. Lastly, the true religion commands
us to put away all disquietude of heart and agitation of mind, and also all commotions and
tempests of the soul, which Apuleius asserts to be continually swelling and surging in the
souls of demons. Why, therefore, except through foolishness and miserable error shouldst
thou humble thyself to worship a being to whom thou desirest to be unlike in thy life? And
why shouldst thou pay religious homage to him whom thou art unwilling to imitate, when
it is the highest duty of religion to imitate Him whom thou worshippest?</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—What Kind of Religion that is Which Teaches that Men Ought to
Employ the Advocacy of Demons in Order to Be Recommended to the Favor of
the Good Gods.</head>
<p>In vain, therefore, have Apuleius, and they who think with him, conferred on the demons
the honor of placing them in the air, between the ethereal heavens and the earth, that they
may carry to the gods the prayers of men, to men the answers of the gods: for Plato held,
they say, that no god has intercourse with man. They who believe these things have thought
it unbecoming that men should have intercourse with the gods, and the gods with men, but
a befitting thing that the demons should have intercourse with both gods and men,
presenting to the gods the petitions of men, and conveying to men what the gods have
granted; so that a chaste man, and one who is a stranger to the crimes of the magic arts,
must use as patrons, through whom the gods may be induced to hear him, demons who
love these crimes, although the very fact of his not loving them ought to have recommended
him to them as one who deserved to be listened to with greater readiness and willingness
on their part. They love the abominations of the stage, which chastity does not love. They
love, in the sorceries of the magicians, “a thousand arts of inflicting harm,”314 which innocence
does not love. Yet both chastity and innocence, if they wish to obtain anything from
the gods, will not be able to do so by their own merits, except their enemies act as mediators
on their behalf. Apuleius need not attempt to justify the fictions of the poets, and the
mockeries of the stage. If human modesty can act so faithlessly towards itself as not only
to love shameful things, but even to think that they are pleasing to the divinity, we can cite
on the other side their own highest authority and teacher, Plato.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Of the Impiety of the Magic Art, Which is Dependent on the Assistance
of Malign Spirits.</head>
<p>Moreover, against those magic arts, concerning which some men, exceedingly wretched
and exceedingly impious, delight to boast, may not public opinion itself be brought forward
as a witness? For why are those arts so severely punished by the laws, if they are the works
of deities who ought to be worshipped? Shall it be said that the Christians have or dained
those laws by which magic arts are punished? With what other meaning, except that these
sorceries are without doubt pernicious to the human race, did the most illustrious poet say,
<lg>
<l>“By heaven, I swear, and your dear life,</l>
<l rend="indent">Unwillingly these arms I wield,</l>
<l>And take, to meet the coming strife,</l>
<l rend="indent">Enchantment’s sword and shield.”315</l>
<l>And that also which he says in another place concerning magic arts,</l>
<l>“I’ve seen him to another place transport the standing corn,”316</l>
</lg>
has reference to the fact that the fruits of one field are said to be transferred to another
by these arts which this pestiferous and accursed doctrine teaches. Does not Cicero inform
us that, among the laws of the Twelve Tables, that is, the most ancient laws of the Romans,
there was a law written which appointed a punishment to be inflicted on him who should
do this?317 Lastly, was it before Christian judges that Apuleius himself was accused of magic
arts?318 Had he known these arts to be divine and pious, and congruous with the works of
divine power, he ought not only to have confessed, but also to have professed them, rather
blaming the laws by which these things were prohibited and pronounced worthy of condemnation,
while they ought to have been held worthy of admiration and respect. For by so
doing, either he would have persuaded the judges to adopt his own opinion, or, if they had
shown their partiality for unjust laws, and condemned him to death notwithstanding his
praising and commending such things, the demons would have bestowed on his soul such
rewards as he deserved, who, in order to proclaim and set forth their divine works, had not
feared the loss of his human life. As our martyrs, when that religion was charged on them
as a crime, by which they knew they were made safe and most glorious throughout eternity,
did not choose, by denying it, to escape temporal punishments, but rather by confessing,
<note type="footnote">315 Virgil, Æn. 4. 492, 493.</note>
<note type="footnote">316 Virgil, Ec. 8. 99.</note>
<note type="footnote">317 Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxviii. 2) and others quote the law as running: Qui fruges incantasit, qui malum carmen
incantasit…neu alienam segetem pelexeris.</note>
<note type="footnote">318 Before Claudius, the prefect of Africa, a heathen.</note>

<pb n="370"/>
professing, and proclaiming it, by enduring all things for it with fidelity and fortitude, and
by dying for it with pious calmness, put to shame the law by which that religion was prohibited,
and caused its revocation. But there is extant a most copious and eloquent oration of
this Platonic philosopher, in which he defends himself against the charge of practising these
arts, affirming that he is wholly a stranger to them, and only wishing to show his innocence
by denying such things as cannot be innocently committed. But all the miracles of the magicians,
who he thinks are justly deserving of condemnation, are performed according to
the teaching and by the power of demons. Why, then, does he think that they ought to be
honored? For he asserts that they are necessary, in order to present our prayers to the gods,
and yet their works are such as we must shun if we wish our prayers to reach the true God.
Again, I ask, what kind of prayers of men does he suppose are presented to the good gods
by the demons? If magical prayers, they will have none such; if lawful prayers, they will not
receive them through such beings. But if a sinner who is penitent pour out prayers, especially
if he has committed any crime of sorcery, does he receive pardon through the intercession
of those demons by whose instigation and help he has fallen into the sin he mourns? or do
the demons themselves, in order that they may merit pardon for the penitent, first become
penitents because they have deceived them? This no one ever said concerning the demons;
for had this been the case, they would never have dared to seek for themselves divine honors.
For how should they do so who desired by penitence to obtain the grace of pardon; seeing
that such detestable pride could not exist along with a humility worthy of pardon?</p>

the gods? and if so, what, pray, is that cause, what is that so great necessity? Because, say
they, no god has intercourse with man. Most admirable holiness of God, which has no intercourse

<head>Chapter 21.—Whether the Gods Use the Demons as Messengers and Interpreters,
and Whether They are Deceived by Them Willingly, or Without Their Own
Knowledge.</head>
<p>But herein, no doubt, lies the great necessity for this absurdity, so unworthy of the gods,
that the ethereal gods, who are concerned about human affairs, would not know what terrestrial
men were doing unless the aerial demons should bring them intelligence, because
the ether is suspended far away from the earth and far above it, but the air is contiguous
both to the ether and to the earth. O admirable wisdom! what else do these men think
concerning the gods who, they say, are all in the highest degree good, but that they are
concerned about human affairs, lest they should seem unworthy of worship, whilst, on the
other hand, from the distance between the elements, they are ignorant of terrestrial things?
It is on this account that they have supposed the demons to be necessary as agents, through
whom the gods may inform themselves with respect to human affairs, and through whom,
when necessary, they may succor men; and it is on account of this office that the demons
themselves have been held as deserving of worship. If this be the case, then a demon is
better known by these good gods through nearness of body, than a man is by goodness of
mind. O mournful necessity, or shall I not rather say detestable and vain error, that I may
not impute vanity to the divine nature! For if the gods can, with their minds free from the
hindrance of bodies, see our mind, they do not need the demons as messengers from our
mind to them; but if the ethereal gods, by means of their bodies, perceive the corporeal indices
of minds, as the countenance, speech, motion, and thence understand what the demons tell
them, then it is also possible that they may be deceived by the falsehoods of demons.
Moreover, if the divinity of the gods cannot be deceived by the demons, neither can it be
ignorant of our actions. But I would they would tell me whether the demons have informed
the gods that the fictions of the poets concerning the crimes of the gods displease Plato,
concealing the pleasure which they themselves take in them; or whether they have concealed
both, and have preferred that the gods should be ignorant with respect to this whole matter,
or have told both, as well the pious prudence of Plato with respect to the gods as their own
lust, which is injurious to the gods; or whether they have concealed Plato’s opinion, according
to which he was unwilling that the gods should be defamed with falsely alleged crimes
through the impious license of the poets, whilst they have not been ashamed nor afraid to
make known their own wickedness, which make them love theatrical plays, in which the
infamous deeds of the gods are celebrated. Let them choose which they will of these four
alternatives, and let them consider how much evil any one of them would require them to
think of the gods. For if they choose the first, they must then confess that it was not possible
for the good gods to dwell with the good Plato, though he sought to prohibit things injurious
to them, whilst they dwelt with evil demons, who exulted in their injuries; and this because

<pb n="373"/>
they suppose that the good gods can only know a good man, placed at so great a distance
from them, through the mediation of evil demons, whom they could know on account of
their nearness to themselves.319 If they shall choose the second, and shall say that both
these things are concealed by the demons, so that the gods are wholly ignorant both of Plato’s
most religious law and the sacrilegious pleasure of the demons, what, in that case, can the
gods know to any profit with respect to human affairs through these mediating demons,
when they do not know those things which are decreed, through the piety of good men, for
the honor of the good gods against the lust of evil demons? But if they shall choose the
third, and reply that these intermediary demons have communicated, not only the opinion
of Plato, which prohibited wrongs to be done to the gods, but also their own delight in these
wrongs, I would ask if such a communication is not rather an insult? Now the gods, hearing
both and knowing both, not only permit the approach of those malign demons, who desire
and do things contrary to the dignity of the gods and the religion of Plato, but also, through
these wicked demons, who are near to them, send good things to the good Plato, who is far
away from them; for they inhabit such a place in the concatenated series of the elements,
that they can come into contact with those by whom they are accused, but not with him by
whom they are defended,—knowing the truth on both sides, but not being able to change
the weight of the air and the earth. There remains the fourth supposition; but it is worse
than the rest. For who will suffer it to be said that the demons have made known the
calumnious fictions of the poets concerning the immortal gods, and also the disgraceful
mockeries of the theatres, and their own most ardent lust after, and most sweet pleasure in
these things, whilst they have concealed from them that Plato, with the gravity of a philosopher,
gave it as his opinion that all these things ought to be removed from a well-regulated
republic; so that the good gods are now compelled, through such messengers, to know the
evil doings of the most wicked beings, that is to say, of the messengers themselves, and are
not allowed to know the good deeds of the philosophers, though the former are for the injury,
but these latter for the honor of the gods themselves?</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—That We Must, Notwithstanding the Opinion of Apuleius, Reject the
Worship of Demons.</head>
<p>None of these four alternatives, then, is to be chosen; for we dare not suppose such unbecoming
things concerning the gods as the adoption of any one of them would lead us to
think. It remains, therefore, that no credence whatever is to be given to the opinion of
Apuleius and the other philosophers of the same school, namely, that the demons act as
messengers and interpreters between the gods and men to carry our petitions from us to
the gods, and to bring back to us the help of the gods. On the contrary, we must believe
them to be spirits most eager to inflict harm, utterly alien from righteousness, swollen with
pride, pale with envy, subtle in deceit; who dwell indeed in this air as in a prison, in keeping
with their own character, because, cast down from the height of the higher heaven, they
have been condemned to dwell in this element as the just reward of irretrievable transgression.
But, though the air is situated above the earth and the waters, they are not on that
account superior in merit to men, who, though they do not surpass them as far as their
earthly bodies are concerned, do nevertheless far excel them through piety of mind,—they
having made choice of the true God as their helper. Over many, however, who are manifestly
unworthy of participation in the true religion, they tyrannize as over captives whom they
have subdued,—the greatest part of whom they have persuaded of their divinity by wonderful
and lying signs, consisting either of deeds or of predictions. Some, nevertheless, who have
more attentively and diligently considered their vices, they have not been able to persuade
that they are gods, and so have feigned themselves to be messengers between the gods and
men. Some, indeed, have thought that not even this latter honor ought to be acknowledged
as belonging to them, not believing that they were gods, because they saw that they were
wicked, whereas the gods, according to their view, are all good. Nevertheless they dared
not say that they were wholly unworthy of all divine honor, for fear of offending the multitude,
by whom, through inveterate superstition, the demons were served by the performance
of many rites, and the erection of many temples.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—What Hermes Trismegistus Thought Concerning Idolatry, and from
What Source He Knew that the Superstitions of Egypt Were to Be Abolished.</head>
<p>The Egyptian Hermes, whom they call Trismegistus, had a different opinion concerning
those demons. Apuleius, indeed, denies that they are gods; but when he says that they hold
a middle place between the gods and men, so that they seem to be necessary for men as
mediators between them and the gods, he does not distinguish between the worship due to
them and the religious homage due to the supernal gods. This Egyptian, however, says that
there are some gods made by the supreme God, and some made by men. Any one who
hears this, as I have stated it, no doubt supposes that it has reference to images, because they
are the works of the hands of men; but he asserts that visible and tangible images are, as it
were, only the bodies of the gods, and that there dwell in them certain spirits, which have
been invited to come into them, and which have power to inflict harm, or to fulfil the desires
of those by whom divine honors and services are rendered to them. To unite, therefore, by
a certain art, those invisible spirits to visible and material things, so as to make, as it were,
animated bodies, dedicated and given up to those spirits who inhabit them,—this, he says,
is to make gods, adding that men have received this great and wonderful power. I will give
the words of this Egyptian as they have been translated into our tongue: “And, since we
have undertaken to discourse concerning the relationship and fellowship between men and
the gods, know, O Æsculapius, the power and strength of man. As the Lord and Father, or
that which is highest, even God, is the maker of the celestial gods, so man is the maker of
the gods who are in the temples, content to dwell near to men.”320 And a little after he says,
“Thus humanity, always mindful of its nature and origin, perseveres in the imitation of divinity;
and as the Lord and Father made eternal gods, that they should be like Himself, so
humanity fashioned its own gods according to the likeness of its own countenance.” When
this Æsculapius, to whom especially he was speaking, had answered him, and had said,
“Dost thou mean the statues, O Trismegistus?”—“Yes, the statues,” replied he, “however
unbelieving thou art, O Æsculapius,—the statues, animated and full of sensation and spirit,
and who do such great and wonderful things,—the statues prescient of future things, and
foretelling them by lot, by prophet, by dreams, and many other things, who bring diseases
on men and cure them again, giving them joy or sorrow according to their merits. Dost
thou not know, O Æsculapius, that Egypt is an image of heaven, or, more truly, a translation
and descent of all things which are ordered and transacted there, that it is, in truth, if we
may say so, to be the temple of the whole world? And yet, as it becomes the prudent man
to know all things beforehand, ye ought not to be ignorant of this, that there is a time coming
when it shall appear that the Egyptians have all in vain, with pious mind, and with most
<note type="footnote">320 These quotations are from a dialogue between Hermes and Æsculapius, which is said to have been
translated into Latin by Apuleius.</note>

<pb n="376"/>
scrupulous diligence, waited on the divinity, and when all their holy worship shall come to
nought, and be found to be in vain.”</p>
<p>Hermes then follows out at great length the statements of this passage, in which he
seems to predict the present time, in which the Christian religion is overthrowing all lying
figments with a vehemence and liberty proportioned to its superior truth and holiness, in
order that the grace of the true Saviour may deliver men from those gods which man has
made, and subject them to that God by whom man was made. But when Hermes predicts
these things, he speaks as one who is a friend to these same mockeries of demons, and does
not clearly express the name of Christ. On the contrary, he deplores, as if it had already
taken place, the future abolition of those things by the observance of which there was
maintained in Egypt a resemblance of heaven,—he bears witness to Christianity by a kind
of mournful prophecy. Now it was with reference to such that the apostle said, that
“knowing God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in
their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; professing themselves to be wise,
they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the
image of corruptible man,”321 and so on, for the whole passage is too long to quote. For
Hermes makes many such statements agreeable to the truth concerning the one true God
who fashioned this world. And I know not how he has become so bewildered by that
“darkening of the heart” as to stumble into the expression of a desire that men should always
continue in subjection to those gods which he confesses to be made by men, and to bewail
their future removal; as if there could be anything more wretched than mankind tyrannized
over by the work of his own hands, since man, by worshipping the works of his own hands,
may more easily cease to be man, than the works of his hands can, through his worship of
them, become gods. For it can sooner happen that man, who has received an honorable
position, may, through lack of understanding, become comparable to the beasts, than that
the works of man may become preferable to the work of God, made in His own image, that
is, to man himself. Wherefore deservedly is man left to fall away from Him who made Him,
when he prefers to himself that which he himself has made.</p>
<p>For these vain, deceitful, pernicious, sacrilegious things did the Egyptian Hermes sorrow,
because he knew that the time was coming when they should be removed. But his sorrow
was as impudently expressed as his knowledge was imprudently obtained; for it was not the
Holy Spirit who revealed these things to him, as He had done to the holy prophets, who,
foreseeing these things, said with exultation, “If a man shall make gods, lo, they are no
gods;”322 and in another place, “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I
will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered.”323

But the holy Isaiah prophesies expressly concerning Egypt in reference to this matter, saying,
“And the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence, and their heart shall be overcome
in them,”324 and other things to the same effect. And with the prophet are to be classed
those who rejoiced that that which they knew was to come had actually come,—as Simeon,
or Anna, who immediately recognized Jesus when He was born, or Elisabeth, who in the
Spirit recognized Him when He was conceived, or Peter, who said by the revelation of the
Father, “Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.”325 But to this Egyptian those spirits
indicated the time of their own destruction, who also, when the Lord was present in the
flesh, said with trembling, “Art Thou come hither to destroy us before the time?”326 meaning
by destruction before the time, either that very destruction which they expected to come,
but which they did not think would come so suddenly as it appeared to have done, or only
that destruction which consisted in their being brought into contempt by being made known.
And, indeed, this was a destruction before the time, that is, before the time of judgment,
when they are to be punished with eternal damnation, together with all men who are implicated
in their wickedness, as the true religion declares, which neither errs nor leads into error;
for it is not like him who, blown hither and thither by every wind of doctrine, and mixing
true things with things which are false, bewails as about to perish a religion, which he afterwards
confesses to be error.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—How Hermes Openly Confessed the Error of His Forefathers, the
Coming Destruction of Which He Nevertheless Bewailed.</head>
<p>After a long interval, Hermes again comes back to the subject of the gods which men
have made, saying as follows: “But enough on this subject. Let us return to man and to
reason, that divine gift on account of which man has been called a rational animal. For the
things which have been said concerning man, wonderful though they are, are less wonderful
than those which have been said concerning reason. For man to discover the divine nature,
and to make it, surpasses the wonder of all other wonderful things. Because, therefore, our
forefathers erred very far with respect to the knowledge of the gods, through incredulity
and through want of attention to their worship and service, they invented this art of making
gods; and this art once invented, they associated with it a suitable virtue borrowed from
universal nature, and being incapable of making souls, they evoked those of demons or of
angels, and united them with these holy images and divine mysteries, in order that through
these souls the images might have power to do good or harm to men.” I know not whether
the demons themselves could have been made, even by adjuration, to confess as he has
confessed in these words: “Because our forefathers erred very far with respect to the
knowledge of the gods, through incredulity and through want of attention to their worship
and service, they invented the art of making gods.” Does he say that it was a moderate degree
of error which resulted in their discovery of the art of making gods, or was he content to
say “they erred?” No; he must needs add “very far,” and say, “They erred very far.” It was
this great error and incredulity, then, of their forefathers who did not attend to the worship
and service of the gods, which was the origin of the art of making gods. And yet this wise
man grieves over the ruin of this art at some future time, as if it were a divine religion. Is
he not verily compelled by divine influence, on the one hand, to reveal the past error of his
forefathers, and by a diabolical influence, on the other hand, to bewail the future punishment
of demons? For if their forefathers, by erring very far with respect to the knowledge of the
gods, through incredulity and aversion of mind from their worship and service, invented
the art of making gods, what wonder is it that all that is done by this detestable art, which
is opposed to the divine religion, should be taken away by that religion, when truth corrects
error, faith refutes incredulity, and conversion rectifies aversion?</p>
<p>For if he had only said, without mentioning the cause, that his forefathers had discovered
the art of making gods, it would have been our duty, if we paid any regard to what is right
and pious, to consider and to see that they could never have attained to this art if they had
not erred from the truth, if they had believed those things which are worthy of God, if they
had attended to divine worship and service. However, if we alone should say that the causes
of this art were to be found in the great error and incredulity of men, and aversion of the
mind erring from and unfaithful to divine religion, the impudence of those who resist the
truth were in some way to be borne with; but when he who admires in man, above all other

<pb n="379"/>
things, this power which it has been granted him to practise, and sorrows because a time is
coming when all those figments of gods invented by men shall even be commanded by the
laws to be taken away,—when even this man confesses nevertheless, and explains the causes
which led to the discovery of this art, saying that their ancestors, through great error and
incredulity, and through not attending to the worship and service of the gods, invented this
art of making gods,—what ought we to say, or rather to do, but to give to the Lord our God
all the thanks we are able, because He has taken away those things by causes the contrary
of those which led to their institution? For that which the prevalence of error instituted,
the way of truth took away; that which incredulity instituted, faith took away; that which
aversion from divine worship and service instituted, conversion to the one true and holy
God took away. Nor was this the case only in Egypt, for which country alone the spirit of
the demons lamented in Hermes, but in all the earth, which sings to the Lord a new song,327
as the truly holy and truly prophetic Scriptures have predicted, in which it is written, “Sing
unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.” For the title of this psalm is,
“When the house was built after the captivity.” For a house is being built to the Lord in all
the earth, even the city of God, which is the holy Church, after that captivity in which demons
held captive those men who, through faith in God, became living stones in the house. For
although man made gods, it did not follow that he who made them was not held captive by
them, when, by worshipping them, he was drawn into fellowship with them,—into the fellowship
not of stolid idols, but of cunning demons; for what are idols but what they are
represented to be in the same scriptures, “They have eyes, but they do not see,”328 and,
though artistically fashioned, are still without life and sensation? But unclean spirits, associated
through that wicked art with these same idols, have miserably taken captive the souls
of their worshippers, by bringing them down into fellowship with themselves. Whence the
apostle says, “We know that an idol is nothing, but those things which the Gentiles sacrifice
they sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I would not ye should have fellowship with
demons.”329 After this captivity, therefore, in which men were held by malign demons, the
house of God is being built in all the earth; whence the title of that psalm in which it is said,
“Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, bless
His name; declare well His salvation from day to day. Declare His glory among the nations,
among all people His wonderful things. For great is the Lord, and much to be praised: He
is terrible above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are demons: but the Lord made
the heavens.”330</p>

<pb n="380"/>
<p>Wherefore he who sorrowed because a time was coming when the worship of idols
should be abolished, and the domination of the demons over those who worshipped them,
wished, under the influence of a demon, that that captivity should always continue, at the
cessation of which that psalm celebrates the building of the house of the Lord in all the
earth. Hermes foretold these things with grief, the prophet with joyfulness; and because the
Spirit is victorious who sang these things through the ancient prophets, even Hermes himself
was compelled in a wonderful manner to confess, that those very things which he wished
not to be removed, and at the prospect of whose removal he was sorrowful, had been instituted,
not by prudent, faithful, and religious, but by erring and unbelieving men, averse to
the worship and service of the gods. And although he calls them gods, nevertheless, when
he says that they were made by such men as we certainly ought not to be, he shows, whether
he will or not, that they are not to be worshipped by those who do not resemble these imagemakers,
that is, by prudent, faithful, and religious men, at the same time also making it
manifest that the very men who made them involved themselves in the worship of those as
gods who were not gods. For true is the saying of the prophet, “If a man make gods, lo, they
are no gods.”331 Such gods, therefore, acknowledged by such worshippers and made by
such men, did Hermes call “gods made by men,” that is to say, demons, through some art
of I know not what description, bound by the chains of their own lusts to images. But,
nevertheless, he did not agree with that opinion of the Platonic Apuleius, of which we have
already shown the incongruity and absurdity, namely, that they were interpreters and intercessors
between the gods whom God made, and men whom the same God made, bringing
to God the prayers of men, and from God the gifts given in answer to these prayers. For it
is exceedingly stupid to believe that gods whom men have made have more influence with
gods whom God has made than men themselves have, whom the very same God has made.
And consider, too, that it is a demon which, bound by a man to an image by means of an
impious art, has been made a god, but a god to such a man only, not to every man. What
kind of god, therefore, is that which no man would make but one erring, incredulous, and
averse to the true God? Moreover, if the demons which are worshipped in the temples, being
introduced by some kind of strange art into images, that is, into visible representations of
themselves, by those men who by this art made gods when they were straying away from,
and were averse to the worship and service of the gods,—if, I say, those demons are neither
mediators nor interpreters between men and the gods, both on account of their own most
wicked and base manners, and because men, though erring, incredulous, and averse from
the worship and service of the gods, are nevertheless beyond doubt better than the demons
whom they themselves have evoked, then it remains to be affirmed that what power they
possess they possess as demons, doing harm by bestowing pretended benefits,—harm all
<note type="footnote">331 Jer. xvi. 20.</note>

<pb n="381"/>
the greater for the deception,—or else openly and undisguisedly doing evil to men. They
cannot, however, do anything of this kind unless where they are permitted by the deep and
secret providence of God, and then only so far as they are permitted. When, however, they
are permitted, it is not because they, being midway between men and the gods, have through
the friendship of the gods great power over men; for these demons cannot possibly be friends
to the good gods who dwell in the holy and heavenly habitation, by whom we mean holy
angels and rational creatures, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers,
from whom they are as far separated in disposition and character as vice is distant from
virtue, wickedness from goodness.</p>

<p>Wherefore we must by no means seek, through the supposed mediation of demons, to
avail ourselves of the benevolence or beneficence of the gods, or rather of the good angels,
but through resembling them in the possession of a good will, through which we are with
them, and live with them, and worship with them the same God, although we cannot see
them with the eyes of our flesh. But it is not in locality we are distant from them, but in
merit of life, caused by our miserable unlikeness to them in will, and by the weakness of our
character; for the mere fact of our dwelling on earth under the conditions of life in the flesh
does not prevent our fellowship with them. It is only prevented when we, in the impurity
of our hearts, mind earthly things. But in this present time, while we are being healed that
we may eventually be as they are, we are brought near to them by faith, if by their assistance
we believe that He who is their blessedness is also ours.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—That All the Religion of the Pagans Has Reference to Dead Men.</head>
<p>It is certainly a remarkable thing how this Egyptian, when expressing his grief that a
time was coming when those things would be taken away from Egypt, which he confesses
to have been invented by men erring, incredulous, and averse to the service of divine religion,
says, among other things, “Then shall that land, the most holy place of shrines and temples,
be full of sepulchres and dead men,” as if, in sooth, if these things were not taken away, men
would not die! as if dead bodies could be buried elsewhere than in the ground! as if, as time
advanced, the number of sepulchres must not necessarily increase in proportion to the increase
of the number of the dead! But they who are of a perverse mind, and opposed to us,
suppose that what he grieves for is that the memorials of our martyrs were to succeed to
their temples and shrines, in order, forsooth, that they may have grounds for thinking that
gods were worshipped by the pagans in temples, but that dead men are worshipped by us
in sepulchres. For with such blindness do impious men, as it were, stumble over mountains,
and will not see the things which strike their own eyes, that they do not attend to the fact
that in all the literature of the pagans there are not found any, or scarcely any gods, who
have not been men, to whom, when dead, divine honors have been paid. I will not enlarge
on the fact that Varro says that all dead men are thought by them to be gods—Manes and
proves it by those sacred rites which are performed in honor of almost all the dead, among
which he mentions funeral games, considering this the very highest proof of divinity, because
games are only wont to be celebrated in honor of divinities. Hermes himself, of whom we
are now treating, in that same book in which, as if foretelling future things, he says with
sorrow “Then shall that land, the most holy place of shrines and temples, be full of sepulchres
and dead men,” testifies that the gods of Egypt were dead men. For, having said that their
forefathers, erring very far with respect to the knowledge of the gods, incredulous and inattentive
to the divine worship and service, invented the art of making gods, with which art,
when invented, they associated the appropriate virtue which is inherent in universal nature,
and by mixing up that virtue with this art, they called forth the souls of demons or of angels
(for they could not make souls), and caused them to take possession of, or associate themselves
with holy images and divine mysteries, in order that through these souls the images
might have power to do good or harm to men;—having said this, he goes on, as it were, to
prove it by illustrations, saying, “Thy grandsire, O Æsculapius, the first discoverer of
medicine, to whom a temple was consecrated in a mountain of Libya, near to the shore of
the crocodiles, in which temple lies his earthly man, that is, his body,—for the better part
of him, or rather the whole of him, if the whole man is in the intelligent life, went back to
heaven,—affords even now by his divinity all those helps to infirm men which formerly he
was wont to afford to them by the art of medicine.” He says, therefore that a dead man was
worshipped as a god in that place where he had his sepulchre. He deceives men by a falsehood,
for the man “went back to heaven.” Then he adds “Does not Hermes, who was my

<pb n="384"/>
grandsire, and whose na+me I bear, abiding in the country which is called by his name, help
and preserve all mortals who come to him from every quarter?” For this elder Hermes, that
is, Mercury, who, he says, was his grandsire, is said to be buried in Hermopolis, that is, in
the city called by his name; so here are two gods whom he affirms to have been men, Æsculapius
and Mercury. Now concerning Æsculapius, both the Greeks and the Latins think the
same thing; but as to Mercury, there are many who do not think that he was formerly a
mortal, though Hermes testifies that he was his grandsire. But are these two different individuals
who were called by the same name? I will not dispute much whether they are different
individuals or not. It is sufficient to know that this Mercury of whom Hermes speaks is, as
well as Æsculapius, a god who once was a man, according, to the testimony of this same
Trismegistus, esteemed so great by his countrymen, and also the grandson of Mercury
himself.</p>
<p>Hermes goes on to say, “But do we know how many good things Isis, the wife of Osiris,
bestows when she is propitious, and what great opposition she can offer when enraged?”
Then, in order to show that there were gods made by men through this art, he goes on to
say, “For it is easy for earthly and mundane gods to be angry, being made and composed
by men out of either nature;” thus giving us to understand that he believed that demons
were formerly the souls of dead men, which, as he says, by means of a certain art invented
by men very far in error, incredulous, and irreligious, were caused to take possession of
images, because they who made such gods were not able to make souls. When, therefore,
he says “either nature,” he means soul and body,—the demon being the soul, and the image
the body. What, then, becomes of that mournful complaint, that the land of Egypt, the most
holy place of shrines and temples, was to be full of sepulchres and dead men? Verily, the
fallacious spirit, by whose inspiration Hermes spoke these things, was compelled to confess
through him that even already that land was full of sepulchres and of dead men, whom they
were worshipping as gods. But it was the grief of the demons which was expressing itself
through his mouth, who were sorrowing on account of the punishments which were about
to fall upon them at the tombs of the martyrs. For in many such places they are tortured
and compelled to confess, and are cast out of the bodies of men, of which they had taken
possession.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Concerning the Nature of the Honor Which the Christians Pay to
Their Martyrs.</head>
<p>But, nevertheless, we do not build temples, and ordain priests, rites, and sacrifices for
these same martyrs; for they are not our gods, but their God is our God. Certainly we
honor their reliquaries, as the memorials of holy men of God who strove for the truth even
to the death of their bodies, that the true religion might be made known, and false and fictitious
religions exposed. For if there were some before them who thought that these religions
were really false and fictitious, they were afraid to give expression to their convictions. But
who ever heard a priest of the faithful, standing at an altar built for the honor and worship
of God over the holy body of some martyr, say in the prayers, I offer to thee a sacrifice, O
Peter, or O Paul, or O Cyprian? for it is to God that sacrifices are offered at their tombs,—the
God who made them both men and martyrs, and associated them with holy angels in celestial
honor; and the reason why we pay such honors to their memory is, that by so doing we
may both give thanks to the true God for their victories, and, by recalling them afresh to
remembrance, may stir ourselves up to imitate them by seeking to obtain like crowns and
palms, calling to our help that same God on whom they called. Therefore, whatever honors
the religious may pay in the places of the martyrs, they are but honors rendered to their
memory,332 not sacred rites or sacrifices offered to dead men as to gods. And even such as
bring thither food,—which, indeed, is not done by the better Christians, and in most places
of the world is not done at all,—do so in order that it may be sanctified to them through the
merits of the martyrs, in the name of the Lord of the martyrs, first presenting the food and
offering prayer, and thereafter taking it away to be eaten, or to be in part bestowed upon
the needy.333 But he who knows the one sacrifice of Christians, which is the sacrifice offered
in those places, also knows that these are not sacrifices offered to the martyrs. It is, then,
neither with divine honors nor with human crimes, by which they worship their gods, that
we honor our martyrs; neither do we offer sacrifices to them, or convert the crimes of the
gods into their sacred rites. For let those who will and can read the letter of Alexander to
his mother Olympias, in which he tells the things which were revealed to him by the priest
Leon, and let those who have read it recall to memory what it contains, that they may see
what great abominations have been handed down to memory, not by poets, but by the
mystic writings of the Egyptians, concerning the goddess Isis, the wife of Osiris, and the
parents of both, all of whom, according to these writings, were royal personages. Isis, when
sacrificing to her parents, is said to have discovered a crop of barley, of which she brought
some ears to the king her husband, and his councillor Mercurius, and hence they identify
her with Ceres. Those who read the letter may there see what was the character of those
<note type="footnote">332 Ornamenta memoriarum.</note>
<note type="footnote">333 Comp. The Confessions, vi. 2.</note>

<pb n="386"/>
people to whom when dead sacred rites were instituted as to gods, and what those deeds of
theirs were which furnished the occasion for these rites. Let them not once dare to compare
in any respect those people, though they hold them to be gods, to our holy martyrs, though
we do not hold them to be gods. For we do not ordain priests and offer sacrifices to our
martyrs, as they do to their dead men, for that would be incongruous, undue, and unlawful,
such being due only to God; and thus we do not delight them with their own crimes, or with
such shameful plays as those in which the crimes of the gods are celebrated, which are either
real crimes committed by them at a time when they were men, or else, if they never were
men, fictitious crimes invented for the pleasure of noxious demons. The god of Socrates,
if he had a god, cannot have belonged to this class of demons. But perhaps they who wished
to excel in this art of making gods, imposed a god of this sort on a man who was a stranger
to, and innocent of any connection with that art. What need we say more? No one who is
even moderately wise imagines that demons are to be worshipped on account of the blessed
life which is to be after death. But perhaps they will say that all the gods are good, but that
of the demons some are bad and some good, and that it is the good who are to be worshipped,
in order that through them we may attain to the eternally blessed life. To the examination
of this opinion we will devote the following book.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="388"/>
<head>Chapter 1.—The Point at Which the Discussion Has Arrived, and What Remains
to Be Handled.</head>
<p>Some have advanced the opinion that there are both good and bad gods; but some,
thinking more respectfully of the gods, have attributed to them so much honor and praise
as to preclude the supposition of any god being wicked. But those who have maintained
that there are wicked gods as well as good ones have included the demons under the name
“gods,” and sometimes though more rarely, have called the gods demons; so that they admit
that Jupiter, whom they make the king and head of all the rest, is called a demon by
Homer.334 Those, on the other hand, who maintain that the gods are all good, and far more
excellent than the men who are justly called good, are moved by the actions of the demons,
which they can neither deny nor impute to the gods whose goodness they affirm, to distinguish
between gods and demons; so that, whenever they find anything offensive in the deeds
or sentiments by which unseen spirits manifest their power, they believe this to proceed not
from the gods, but from the demons. At the same time they believe that, as no god can hold
direct intercourse with men, these demons hold the position of mediators, ascending with
prayers, and returning with gifts. This is the opinion of the Platonists, the ablest and most
esteemed of their philosophers, with whom we therefore chose to debate this question,—
whether the worship of a number of gods is of any service toward obtaining
blessedness in the future life. And this is the reason why, in the preceding book, we have
inquired how the demons, who take pleasure in such things as good and wise men loathe
and execrate, in the sacrilegious and immoral fictions which the poets have written not of
men, but of the gods themselves, and in the wicked and criminal violence of magical arts,
can be regarded as more nearly related and more friendly to the gods than men are, and can
mediate between good men and the good gods; and it has been demonstrated that this is
absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>This book, then, ought, according to the promise made in the end of the preceding one,
to contain a discussion, not of the difference which exists among the gods, who, according
to the Platonists, are all good, nor of the difference between gods and demons, the former
of whom they separate by a wide interval from men, while the latter are placed intermediately
between the gods and men, but of the difference, since they make one, among the demons
themselves. This we shall discuss so far as it bears on our theme. It has been the common
and usual belief that some of the demons are bad, others good; and this opinon, whether it
be that of the Platonists or any other sect, must by no means be passed over in silence, lest
some one suppose he ought to cultivate the good demons in order that by their mediation
he may be accepted by the gods, all of whom he believes to be good, and that he may live
with them after death; whereas he would thus be ensnared in the toils of wicked spirits, and
would wander far from the true God, with whom alone, and in whom alone, the human
soul, that is to say, the soul that is rational and intellectual, is blessed.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—What Apuleius Attributes to the Demons, to Whom, Though He Does
Not Deny Them Reason, He Does Not Ascribe Virtue.</head>
<p>What, then, is the difference between good and evil demons? For the Platonist Apuleius,
in a treatise on this whole subject,335 while he says a great deal about their aerial bodies, has
not a word to say of the spiritual virtues with which, if they were good, they must have been
endowed. Not a word has he said, then, of that which could give them happiness; but proof
of their misery he has given, acknowledging that their mind, by which they rank as reasonable
beings, is not only not imbued and fortified with virtue so as to resist all unreasonable passions,
but that it is somehow agitated with tempestuous emotions, and is thus on a level
with the mind of foolish men. His own words are: “It is this class of demons the poets refer
to, when, without serious error, they feign that the gods hate and love individuals among
men, prospering and ennobling some, and opposing and distressing others. Therefore pity,
indignation, grief, joy, every human emotion is experienced by the demons, with the same
mental disturbance, and the same tide of feeling and thought. These turmoils and tempests
banish them far from the tranquility of the celestial gods.” Can there be any doubt that in
these words it is not some inferior part of their spiritual nature, but the very mind by which
the demons hold their rank as rational beings, which he says is tossed with passion like a
stormy sea? They cannot, then, be compared even to wise men, who with undisturbed mind
resist these perturbations to which they are exposed in this life, and from which human infirmity
is never exempt, and who do not yield themselves to approve of or perpetrate anything
which might deflect them from the path of wisdom and law of rectitude. They resemble in
character, though not in bodily appearance, wicked and foolish men. I might indeed say
they are worse, inasmuch as they have grown old in iniquity, and incorrigible by punishment.
Their mind, as Apuleius says, is a sea tossed with tempest, having no rallying point of truth
or virtue in their soul from which they can resist their turbulent and depraved emotions.</p>

<p>Among the philosophers there are two opinions about these mental emotions, which
the Greeks call παθη, while some of our own writers, as Cicero, call them perturbations,336
some affections, and some, to render the Greek word more accurately, passions. Some say
that even the wise man is subject to these perturbations, though moderated and controlled
by reason, which imposes laws upon them, and so restrains them within necessary bounds.
This is the opinion of the Platonists and Aristotelians; for Aristotle was Plato’s disciple, and
the founder of the Peripatetic school. But others, as the Stoics, are of opinion that the wise
man is not subject to these perturbations. But Cicero, in his book De Finibus, shows that
the Stoics are here at variance with the Platonists and Peripatetics rather in words than in
reality; for the Stoics decline to apply the term “goods” to external and bodily advantages,337
because they reckon that the only good is virtue, the art of living well, and this exists only
in the mind. The other philosophers, again, use the simple and customary phraseology, and
do not scruple to call these things goods, though in comparison of virtue, which guides our
life, they are little and of small esteem. And thus it is obvious that, whether these outward
things are called goods or advantages, they are held in the same estimation by both parties,
and that in this matter the Stoics are pleasing themselves merely with a novel phraseology.
It seems, then, to me that in this question, whether the wise man is subject to mental passions,
or wholly free from them, the controversy is one of words rather than of things; for I think
that, if the reality and not the mere sound of the words is considered, the Stoics hold precisely
the same opinion as the Platonists and Peripatetics. For, omitting for brevity’s sake other
proofs which I might adduce in support of this opinion, I will state but one which I consider
conclusive. Aulus Gellius, a man of extensive erudition, and gifted with an eloquent and
graceful style, relates, in his work entitled Noctes Atticæ338that he once made a voyage with
an eminent Stoic philosopher; and he goes on to relate fully and with gusto what I shall
barely state, that when the ship was tossed and in danger from a violent storm, the philosopher
grew pale with terror. This was noticed by those on board, who, though themselves
threatened with death, were curious to see whether a philosopher would be agitated like
other men. When the tempest had passed over, and as soon as their security gave them
freedom to resume their talk, one of the passengers, a rich and luxurious Asiatic, begins to
banter the philosopher, and rally him because he had even become pale with fear, while he
himself had been unmoved by the impending destruction. But the philosopher availed
himself of the reply of Aristippus the Socratic, who, on finding himself similarly bantered
<note type="footnote">336 De Fin. iii. 20; Tusc. Disp. iii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">337 The distinction between bona and commoda is thus given by Seneca (Ep. 87, ad fin.): Commodum est

<pb n="392"/>
by a man of the same character, answered, “You had no cause for anxiety for the soul of a
profligate debauchee, but I had reason to be alarmed for the soul of Aristippus.” The rich
man being thus disposed of, Aulus Gellius asked the philosopher, in the interests of science
and not to annoy him, what was the reason of his fear? And he willing to instruct a man so
zealous in the pursuit of knowledge, at once took from his wallet a book of Epictetus the
Stoic,339 in which doctrines were advanced which precisely harmonized with those of Zeno
and Chrysippus, the founders of the Stoical school. Aulus Gellius says that he read in this
book that the Stoics maintain that there are certain impressions made on the soul by external
objects which they call phantasiæ, and that it is not in the power of the soul to determine
whether or when it shall be invaded by these. When these impressions are made by alarming
and formidable objects, it must needs be that they move the soul even of the wise man, so
that for a little he trembles with fear, or is depressed by sadness, these impressions anticipating
the work of reason and self-control; but this does not imply that the mind accepts
these evil impressions, or approves or consents to them. For this consent is, they think, in
a man’s power; there being this difference between the mind of the wise man and that of
the fool, that the fool’s mind yields to these passions and consents to them, while that of the
wise man, though it cannot help being invaded by them, yet retains with unshaken firmness
a true and steady persuasion of those things which it ought rationally to desire or avoid.
This account of what Aulus Gellius relates that he read in the book of Epictetus about the
sentiments and doctrines of the Stoics I have given as well as I could, not, perhaps, with his
choice language, but with greater brevity, and, I think, with greater clearness. And if this
be true, then there is no difference, or next to none, between the opinion of the Stoics and
that of the other philosophers regarding mental passions and perturbations, for both parties
agree in maintaining that the mind and reason of the wise man are not subject to these.
And perhaps what the Stoics mean by asserting this, is that the wisdom which characterizes
the wise man is clouded by no error and sullied by no taint, but, with this reservation that
his wisdom remains undisturbed, he is exposed to the impressions which the goods and ills
of this life (or, as they prefer to call them, the advantages or disadvantages) make upon
them. For we need not say that if that philosopher had thought nothing of those things
which he thought he was forthwith to lose, life and bodily safety, he would not have been
so terrified by his danger as to betray his fear by the pallor of his cheek. Nevertheless, he
might suffer this mental disturbance, and yet maintain the fixed persuasion that life and
bodily safety, which the violence of the tempest threatened to destroy, are not those good
things which make their possessors good, as the possession of righteousness does. But in
so far as they persist that we must call them not goods but advantages, they quarrel about
words and neglect things. For what difference does it make whether goods or advantages
<note type="footnote">339 See Diog. Laert. ii. 71.</note>

<pb n="393"/>
be the better name, while the Stoic no less than the Peripatetic is alarmed at the prospect of
losing them, and while, though they name them differently, they hold them in like esteem?
Both parties assure us that, if urged to the commission of some immorality or crime by the
threatened loss of these goods or advantages, they would prefer to lose such things as preserve
bodily comfort and security rather than commit such things as violate righteousness. And
thus the mind in which this resolution is well grounded suffers no perturbations to prevail
with it in opposition to reason, even though they assail the weaker parts of the soul; and not
only so, but it rules over them, and, while it refuses its consent and resists them, administers
a reign of virtue. Such a character is ascribed to Æneas by Virgil when he says,
<lg>
<l>“He stands immovable by tears,</l>
<l rend="indent">Nor tenderest words with pity hears.”340</l>

<head>Chapter 5.—That the Passions Which Assail the Souls of Christians Do Not Seduce
Them to Vice, But Exercise Their Virtue.</head>
<p>We need not at present give a careful and copious exposition of the doctrine of Scripture,
the sum of Christian knowledge, regarding these passions. It subjects the mind itself to
God, that He may rule and aid it, and the passions, again, to the mind, to moderate and
bridle them, and turn them to righteous uses. In our ethics, we do not so much inquire
whether a pious soul is angry, as why he is angry; not whether he is sad, but what is the cause
of his sadness; not whether he fears, but what he fears. For I am not aware that any right
thinking person would find fault with anger at a wrongdoer which seeks his amendment,
or with sadness which intends relief to the suffering, or with fear lest one in danger be destroyed.
The Stoics, indeed, are accustomed to condemn compassion.341 But how much
more honorable had it been in that Stoic we have been telling of, had he been disturbed by
compassion prompting him to relieve a fellow-creature, than to be disturbed by the fear of
shipwreck! Far better and more humane, and more consonant with pious sentiments, are
the words of Cicero in praise of Cæsar, when he says, “Among your virtues none is more
admirable and agreeable than your compassion.”342 And what is compassion but a fellowfeeling
for another’s misery, which prompts us to help him if we can? And this emotion is
obedient to reason, when compassion is shown without violating right, as when the poor
are relieved, or the penitent forgiven. Cicero, who knew how to use language, did not hesitate
to call this a virtue, which the Stoics are not ashamed to reckon among the vices, although,
as the book of the eminent Stoic, Epictetus, quoting the opinions of Zeno and
Chrysippus, the founders of the school, has taught us, they admit that passions of this kind
invade the soul of the wise man, whom they would have to be free from all vice. Whence
it follows that these very passions are not judged by them to be vices, since they assail the
wise man without forcing him to act against reason and virtue; and that, therefore, the
opinion of the Peripatetics or Platonists and of the Stoics is one and the same. But, as Cicero
says,343 mere logomachy is the bane of these pitiful Greeks, who thirst for contention rather
than for truth. However, it may justly be asked, whether our subjection to these affections,
even while we follow virtue, is a part of the infirmity of this life? For the holy angels feel no
anger while they punish those whom the eternal law of God consigns to punishment, no
fellow-feeling with misery while they relieve the miserable, no fear while they aid those who
are in danger; and yet ordinary language ascribes to them also these mental emotions, because,
though they have none of our weakness, their acts resemble the actions to which these
emotions move us; and thus even God Himself is said in Scripture to be angry, and yet

disturbing mental affection.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Of the Passions Which, According to Apuleius, Agitate the Demons
Who Are Supposed by Him to Mediate Between Gods and Men.</head>
<p>Deferring for the present the question about the holy angels, let us examine the opinion
of the Platonists, that the demons who mediate between gods and men are agitated by passions.
For if their mind, though exposed to their incursion, still remained free and superior
to them, Apuleius could not have said that their hearts are tossed with passions as the sea
by stormy winds.344 Their mind, then,—that superior part of their soul whereby they are
rational beings, and which, if it actually exists in them, should rule and bridle the turbulent
passions of the inferior parts of the soul,—this mind of theirs, I say, is, according to the
Platonist referred to, tossed with a hurricane of passions. The mind of the demons, therefore,
is subject to the emotions of fear, anger, lust, and all similar affections. What part of them,
then, is free, and endued with wisdom, so that they are pleasing to the gods, and the fit
guides of men into purity of life, since their very highest part, being the slave of passion and
subject to vice, only makes them more intent on deceiving and seducing, in proportion to
the mental force and energy of desire they possess?
<note type="footnote">344 De Deo Soc.</note>

<pb n="397"/>
by Representing Them as Distracted by Party Feeling, to Which the Demons and
Not the Gods, are Subject.</p>
<p>But if any one says that it is not of all the demons, but only of the wicked, that the poets,
not without truth, say that they violently love or hate certain men,—for it was of them
Apuleius said that they were driven about by strong currents of emotion,—how can we
accept this interpretation, when Apuleius, in the very same connection, represents all the
demons, and not only the wicked, as intermediate between gods and men by their aerial
bodies? The fiction of the poets, according to him, consists in their making gods of demons,
and giving them the names of gods, and assigning them as allies or enemies to individual
men, using this poetical license, though they profess that the gods are very different in
character from the demons, and far exalted above them by their celestial abode and wealth
of beatitude. This, I say, is the poets’ fiction, to say that these are gods who are not gods,
and that, under the names of gods, they fight among themselves about the men whom they
love or hate with keen partisan feeling. Apuleius says that this is not far from the truth,
since, though they are wrongfully called by the names of the gods, they are described in their
own proper character as demons. To this category, he says, belongs the Minerva of Homer,
“who interposed in the ranks of the Greeks to restrain Achilles.”345 For that this was Minerva
he supposes to be poetical fiction; for he thinks that Minerva is a goddess, and he places her
among the gods whom he believes to be all good and blessed in the sublime ethereal region,
remote from intercourse with men. But that there was a demon favorable to the Greeks
and adverse to the Trojans, as another, whom the same poet mentions under the name of
Venus or Mars (gods exalted above earthly affairs in their heavenly habitations), was the
Trojans’ ally and the foe of the Greeks, and that these demons fought for those they loved
against those they hated,—in all this he owned that the poets stated something very like the
truth. For they made these statements about beings to whom he ascribes the same violent
and tempestuous passions as disturb men, and who are therefore capable of loves and hatreds
not justly formed, but formed in a party spirit, as the spectators in races or hunts take fancies
and prejudices. It seems to have been the great fear of this Platonist that the poetical fictions
should be believed of the gods, and not of the demons who bore their names.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—How Apuleius Defines the Gods Who Dwell in Heaven, the Demons
Who Occupy the Air, and Men Who Inhabit Earth.</head>
<p>The definition which Apuleius gives of demons, and in which he of course includes all
demons, is that they are in nature animals, in soul subject to passion, in mind reasonable,
in body aerial, in duration eternal. Now in these five qualities he has named absolutely
nothing which is proper to good men and not also to bad. For when Apuleius had spoken
of the celestials first, and had then extended his description so as to include an account of
those who dwell far below on the earth, that, after describing the two extremes of rational
being, he might proceed to speak of the intermediate demons, he says, “Men, therefore, who
are endowed with the faculty of reason and speech, whose soul is immortal and their
members mortal, who have weak and anxious spirits, dull and corruptible bodies, dissimilar
characters, similar ignorance, who are obstinate in their audacity, and persistent in their
hope, whose labor is vain, and whose fortune is ever on the wane, their race immortal,
themselves perishing, each generation replenished with creatures whose life is swift and
their wisdom slow, their death sudden and their life a wail,—these are the men who dwell
on the earth.”346 In recounting so many qualities which belong to the large proportion of
men, did he forget that which is the property of the few when he speaks of their wisdom
being slow? If this had been omitted, this his description of the human race, so carefully
elaborated, would have been defective. And when he commended the excellence of the gods,
he affirmed that they excelled in that very blessedness to which he thinks men must attain
by wisdom. And therefore, if he had wished us to believe that some of the demons are good,
he should have inserted in his description something by which we might see that they have,
in common with the gods, some share of blessedness, or, in common with men, some wisdom.
But, as it is, he has mentioned no good quality by which the good may be distinguished
from the bad. For although he refrained from giving a full account of their wickedness,
through fear of offending, not themselves but their worshippers, for whom he was writing,
yet he sufficiently indicated to discerning readers what opinion he had of them; for only in
the one article of the eternity of their bodies does he assimilate them to the gods, all of whom,
he asserts, are good and blessed, and absolutely free from what he himself calls the stormy
passions of the demons; and as to the soul, he quite plainly affirms that they resemble men
and not the gods, and that this resemblance lies not in the possession of wisdom, which
even men can attain to, but in the perturbation of passions which sway the foolish and
wicked, but is so ruled by the good and wise that they prefer not to admit rather than to
conquer it. For if he had wished it to be understood that the demons resembled the gods
in the eternity not of their bodies but of their souls, he would certainly have admitted men
to share in this privilege, because, as a Platonist, he of course must hold that the human soul
<note type="footnote">346 De Deo Soc.</note>

<pb n="399"/>
is eternal. Accordingly, when describing this race of living beings, he said that their souls
were immortal, their members mortal. And, consequently, if men have not eternity in
common with the gods because they have mortal bodies, demons have eternity in common
with the gods because their bodies are immortal.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Whether the Intercession of the Demons Can Secure for Men the
Friendship of the Celestial Gods.</head>
<p>How, then, can men hope for a favorable introduction to the friendship of the gods by
such mediators as these, who are, like men, defective in that which is the better part of every
living creature, viz., the soul, and who resemble the gods only in the body, which is the inferior
part? For a living creature or animal consists of soul and body, and of these two parts
the soul is undoubtedly the better; even though vicious and weak, it is obviously better than
even the soundest and strongest body, for the greater excellence of its nature is not reduced
to the level of the body even by the pollution of vice, as gold, even when tarnished, is more
precious than the purest silver or lead. And yet these mediators, by whose interposition
things human and divine are to be harmonized, have an eternal body in common with the
gods, and a vicious soul in common with men,—as if the religion by which these demons
are to unite gods and men were a bodily, and not a spiritual matter. What wickedness, then,
or punishment has suspended these false and deceitful mediators, as it were head downwards,
so that their inferior part, their body, is linked to the gods above, and their superior part,
the soul, bound to men beneath; united to the celestial gods by the part that serves, and
miserable, together with the inhabitants of earth, by the part that rules? For the body is the
servant, as Sallust says: “We use the soul to rule, the body to obey;”347 adding, “the one we
have in common with the gods, the other with the brutes.” For he was here speaking of
men; and they have, like the brutes, a mortal body. These demons, whom our philosophic
friends have provided for us as mediators with the gods, may indeed say of the soul and
body, the one we have in common with the gods, the other with men; but, as I said, they are
as it were suspended and bound head downwards, having the slave, the body, in common
with the gods, the master, the soul, in common with miserable men,—their inferior part
exalted, their superior part depressed. And therefore, if any one supposes that, because they
are not subject, like terrestrial animals, to the separation of soul and body by death, they
therefore resemble the gods in their eternity, their body must not be considered a chariot
of an eternal triumph, but rather the chain of an eternal punishment.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—That, According to Plotinus, Men, Whose Body is Mortal, are Less
Wretched Than Demons, Whose Body is Eternal.</head>
<p>Plotinus, whose memory is quite recent,348 enjoys the reputation of having understood
Plato better than any other of his disciples. In speaking of human souls, he says, “The
Father in compassion made their bonds mortal;”349 that is to say, he considered it due to
the Father’s mercy that men, having a mortal body, should not be forever confined in the
misery of this life. But of this mercy the demons have been judged unworthy, and they have
received, in conjunction with a soul subject to passions, a body not mortal like man’s, but
eternal. For they should have been happier than men if they had, like men, had a mortal
body, and, like the gods, a blessed soul. And they should have been equal to men, if in
conjunction with a miserable soul they had at least received, like men, a mortal body, so
that death might have freed them from trouble, if, at least, they should have attained some
degree of piety. But, as it is, they are not only no happier than men, having, like them, a
miserable soul, they are also more wretched, being eternally bound to the body; for he does
not leave us to infer that by some progress in wisdom and piety they can become gods, but
expressly says that they are demons forever.</p>

to moral destruction? For, however wicked men have been, if they suppose they shall become
Larvæ or divine Manes, they will become the worse the more love they have for inflicting
injury; for, as the Larvæ are hurtful demons made out of wicked men, these men must suppose
that after death they will be invoked with sacrifices and divine honors that they may
inflict injuries. But this question we must not pursue. He also states that the blessed are
called in Greek εὐδαίμονες, because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming

<head>Chapter 12.—Of the Three Opposite Qualities by Which the Platonists Distinguish
Between the Nature of Men and that of Demons.</head>
<p>But at present we are speaking of those beings whom he described as being properly
intermediate between gods and men, in nature animals, in mind rational, in soul subject to
passion, in body aerial, in duration eternal. When he had distinguished the gods, whom he
placed in the highest heaven, from men, whom he placed on earth, not only by position but
also by the unequal dignity of their natures, he concluded in these words: “You have here
two kinds of animals: the gods, widely distinguished from men by sublimity of abode, perpetuity
of life, perfection of nature; for their habitations are separated by so wide an interval
that there can be no intimate communication between them, and while the vitality of the
one is eternal and indefeasible, that of the others is fading and precarious, and while the
spirits of the gods are exalted in bliss, those of men are sunk in miseries.”351 Here I find
three opposite qualities ascribed to the extremes of being, the highest and lowest. For, after
mentioning the three qualities for which we are to admire the gods, he repeated, though in
other words, the same three as a foil to the defects of man. The three qualities are, “sublimity
of abode, perpetuity of life, perfection of nature.” These he again mentioned so as to bring
out their contrasts in man’s condition. As he had mentioned “sublimity of abode,” he says,
“Their habitations are separated by so wide an interval;” as he had mentioned “perpetuity
of life,” he says, that “while divine life is eternal and indefeasible, human life is fading and
precarious;” and as he had mentioned “perfection of nature,” he says, that “while the spirits
of the gods are exalted in bliss, those of men are sunk in miseries.” These three things, then,
he predicates of the gods, exaltation, eternity, blessedness; and of man he predicates the
opposite, lowliness of habitation, mortality, misery.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—How the Demons Can Mediate Between Gods and Men If They Have
Nothing in Common with Both, Being Neither Blessed Like the Gods, Nor
Miserable Like Men.</head>
<p>If, now, we endeavor to find between these opposites the mean occupied by the demons,
there can be no question as to their local position; for, between the highest and lowest place,
there is a place which is rightly considered and called the middle place. The other two
qualities remain, and to them we must give greater care, that we may see whether they are
altogether foreign to the demons, or how they are so bestowed upon them without infringing
upon their mediate position. We may dismiss the idea that they are foreign to them. For
we cannot say that the demons, being rational animals, are neither blessed nor wretched,
as we say of the beasts and plants, which are void of feeling and reason, or as we say of the
middle place, that it is neither the highest nor the lowest. The demons, being rational, must
be either miserable or blessed. And, in like manner, we cannot say that they are neither
mortal nor immortal; for all living things either live eternally or end life in death. Our author,
besides, stated that the demons are eternal. What remains for us to suppose, then, but that
these mediate beings are assimilated to the gods in one of the two remaining qualities, and
to men in the other? For if they received both from above, or both from beneath, they should
no longer be mediate, but either rise to the gods above, or sink to men beneath. Therefore,
as it has been demonstrated that they must possess these two qualities, they will hold their
middle place if they receive one from each party. Consequently, as they cannot receive their
eternity from beneath, because it is not there to receive, they must get it from above; and
accordingly they have no choice but to complete their mediate position by accepting misery
from men.</p>
<p>According to the Platonists, then, the gods, who occupy the highest place, enjoy eternal
blessedness, or blessed eternity; men, who occupy the lowest, a mortal misery, or a miserable
mortality; and the demons, who occupy the mean, a miserable eternity, or an eternal misery.
As to those five things which Apu leius included in his definition of demons, he did not
show, as he promised, that the demons are mediate. For three of them, that their nature is
animal, their mind rational, their soul subject to passions, he said that they have in common
with men; one thing, their eternity, in common with the gods; and one proper to themselves,
their aerial body. How, then, are they intermediate, when they have three things in common
with the lowest, and only one in common with the highest? Who does not see that the intermediate
position is abandoned in proportion as they tend to, and are depressed towards,
the lowest extreme? But perhaps we are to accept them as intermediate because of their one
property of an aerial body, as the two extremes have each their proper body, the gods an
ethereal, men a terrestrial body, and because two of the qualities they possess in common
with man they possess also in common with the gods, namely, their animal nature and ra-

<pb n="405"/>
tional mind. For Apuleius himself, in speaking of gods and men, said, “You have two animal
natures.” And Platonists are wont to ascribe a rational mind to the gods. Two qualities remain,
their liability to passion, and their eternity,—the first of which they have in common
with men, the second with the gods; so that they are neither wafted to the highest nor depressed
to the lowest extreme, but perfectly poised in their intermediate position. But then,
this is the very circumstance which constitutes the eternal misery, or miserable eternity, of
the demons. For he who says that their soul is subject to passions would also have said that
they are miserable, had he not blushed for their worshippers. Moreover, as the world is
governed, not by fortuitous haphazard, but, as the Platonists themselves avow, by the
providence of the supreme God, the misery of the demons would not be eternal unless their
wickedness were great.</p>
<p>If, then, the blessed are rightly styled eudemons, the demons intermediate between gods
and men are not eudemons. What, then, is the local position of those good demons, who,
above men but beneath the gods, afford assistance to the former, minister to the latter? For
if they are good and eternal, they are doubtless blessed. But eternal blessedness destroys
their intermediate character, giving them a close resemblance to the gods, and widely separating
them from men. And therefore the Platonists will in vain strive to show how the good
demons, if they are both immortal and blessed, can justly be said to hold a middle place
between the gods, who are immortal and blessed, and men, who are mortal and miserable.
For if they have both immortality and blessedness in common with the gods, and neither
of these in common with men, who are both miserable and mortal, are they not rather remote
from men and united with the gods, than intermediate between them. They would be intermediate
if they held one of their qualities in common with the one party, and the other with
the other, as man is a kind of mean between angels and beasts,—the beast being an irrational
and mortal animal, the angel a rational and immortal one, while man, inferior to the angel
and superior to the beast, and having in common with the one mortality, and with the other
reason, is a rational and mortal animal. So, when we seek for an intermediate between the
blessed immortals and miserable mortals, we should find a being which is either mortal and
blessed, or immortal and miserable.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Whether Men, Though Mortal, Can Enjoy True Blessedness.</head>
<p>It is a great question among men, whether man can be mortal and blessed. Some, taking
the humbler view of his condition, have denied that he is capable of blessedness so long as
he continues in this mortal life; others, again, have spurned this idea, and have been bold
enough to maintain that, even though mortal, men may be blessed by attaining wisdom.
But if this be the case, why are not these wise men constituted mediators between miserable
mortals and the blessed immortals, since they have blessedness in common with the latter,
and mortality in common with the former? Certainly, if they are blessed, they envy no one
(for what more miserable than envy?), but seek with all their might to help miserable mortals
on to blessedness, so that after death they may become immortal, and be associated with
the blessed and immortal angels.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Of the Man Christ Jesus, the Mediator Between God and Men.</head>
<p>But if, as is much more probable and credible, it must needs be that all men, so long as
they are mortal, are also miserable, we must seek an intermediate who is not only man, but
also God, that, by the interposition of His blessed mortality, He may bring men out of their
mortal misery to a blessed immortality. In this intermediate two things are requisite, that
He become mortal, and that He do not continue mortal. He did become mortal, not rendering
the divinity of the Word infirm, but assuming the infirmity of flesh. Neither did He
continue mortal in the flesh, but raised it from the dead; for it is the very fruit of His mediation
that those, for the sake of whose redemption He became the Mediator, should not
abide eternally in bodily death. Wherefore it became the Mediator between us and God to
have both a transient mortality and a permanent blessedness, that by that which is transient
He might be assimilated to mortals, and might translate them from mortality to that which
is permanent. Good angels, therefore, cannot mediate between miserable mortals and
blessed immortals, for they themselves also are both blessed and immortal; but evil angels
can mediate, because they are immortal like the one party, miserable like the other. To these
is opposed the good Mediator, who, in opposition to their immortality and misery, has
chosen to be mortal for a time, and has been able to continue blessed in eternity. It is thus
He has destroyed, by the humility of His death and the benignity of His blessedness, those
proud immortals and hurtful wretches, and has prevented them from seducing to misery
by their boast of immortality those men whose hearts He has cleansed by faith, and whom
He has thus freed from their impure dominion.</p>
<p>Man, then, mortal and miserable, and far removed from the immortal and the blessed,
what medium shall he choose by which he may be united to immortality and blessedness?
The immortality of the demons, which might have some charm for man, is miserable; the
mortality of Christ, which might offend man, exists no longer. In the one there is the fear
of an eternal misery; in the other, death, which could not be eternal, can no longer be feared,
and blessedness, which is eternal, must be loved. For the immortal and miserable mediator
interposes himself to prevent us from passing to a blessed immortality, because that which
hinders such a passage, namely, misery, continues in him; but the mortal and blessed Mediator
interposed Himself, in order that, having passed through mortality, He might of mortals
make immortals (showing His power to do this in His own resurrection), and from being
miserable to raise them to the blessed company from the number of whom He had Himself
never departed. There is, then, a wicked mediator, who separates friends, and a good Mediator,
who reconciles enemies. And those who separate are numerous, because the multitude
of the blessed are blessed only by their participation in the one God; of which participation
the evil angels being deprived, they are wretched, and interpose to hinder rather than to
help to this blessedness, and by their very number prevent us from reaching that one beatific
good, to obtain which we need not many but one Mediator, the uncreated Word of God,

<pb n="408"/>
by whom all things were made, and in partaking of whom we are blessed. I do not say that
He is Mediator because He is the Word, for as the Word He is supremely blessed and supremely
immortal, and therefore far from miserable mortals; but He is Mediator as He is
man, for by His humanity He shows us that, in order to obtain that blessed and beatific
good, we need not seek other mediators to lead us through the successive steps of this attainment,
but that the blessed and beatific God, having Himself become a partaker of our humanity,
has afforded us ready access to the participation of His divinity. For in delivering
us from our mortality and misery, He does not lead us to the immortal and blessed angels,
so that we should become immortal and blessed by participating in their nature, but He
leads us straight to that Trinity, by participating in which the angels themselves are blessed.
Therefore, when He chose to be in the form of a servant, and lower than the angels, that He
might be our Mediator, He remained higher than the angels, in the form of God,—Himself
at once the way of life on earth and life itself in heaven.</p>

<p>16.—Whether It is Reasonable in the Platonists to Determine that the Celestial Gods
Decline Contact with Earthly Things and Intercourse with Men, Who Therefore
Require the Intercession of the Demons.</p>
<p>That opinion, which the same Platonist avers that Plato uttered, is not true, “that no
god holds intercourse with men.”352 And this, he says, is the chief evidence of their exaltation,
that they are never contaminated by contact with men. He admits, therefore, that the
demons are contaminated; and it follows that they cannot cleanse those by whom they are
themselves contaminated, and thus all alike become impure, the demons by associating with
men, and men by worshipping the demons. Or, if they say that the demons are not contaminated
by associating and dealing with men, then they are better than the gods, for the gods,
were they to do so, would be contaminated. For this, we are told, is the glory of the gods,
that they are so highly exalted that no human intercourse can sully them. He affirms, indeed,
that the supreme God, the Creator of all things, whom we call the true God, is spoken of by
Plato as the only God whom the poverty of human speech fails even passably to describe;
and that even the wise, when their mental energy is as far as possible delivered from the
trammels of connection with the body, have only such gleams of insight into His nature as
may be compared to a flash of lightning illumining the darkness. If, then, this supreme
God, who is truly exalted above all things, does nevertheless visit the minds of the wise,
when emancipated from the body, with an intelligible and ineffable presence, though this
be only occasional, and as it were a swift flash of light athwart the darkness, why are the
other gods so sublimely removed from all contact with men, as if they would be polluted
by it? as if it were not a sufficient refutation of this to lift up our eyes to those heavenly
bodies which give the earth its needful light. If the stars, though they, by his account, are
visible gods, are not contaminated when we look at them, neither are the demons contaminated
when men see them quite closely. But perhaps it is the human voice, and not the
eye, which pollutes the gods; and therefore the demons are appointed to mediate and carry
men’s utterances to the gods, who keep themselves remote through fear of pollution? What
am I to say of the other senses? For by smell neither the demons, who are present, nor the
gods, though they were present and inhaling the exhalations of living men, would be polluted
if they are not contaminated with the effluvia of the carcasses offered in sacrifice. As for
taste, they are pressed by no necessity of repairing bodily decay, so as to be reduced to ask
food from men. And touch is in their own power. For while it may seem that contact is so
called, because the sense of touch is specially concerned in it, yet the gods, if so minded,
might mingle with men, so as to see and be seen, hear and be heard; and where is the need
of touching? For men would not dare to desire this, if they were favored with the sight or
conversation of gods or good demons; and if through excessive curiosity they should desire
<note type="footnote">352 Apuleius, ibid.</note>

<pb n="410"/>
it, how could they accomplish their wish without the consent of the god or demon, when
they cannot touch so much as a sparrow unless it be caged?</p>
<p>There is, then, nothing to hinder the gods from mingling in a bodily form with men,
from seeing and being seen, from speaking and hearing. And if the demons do thus mix
with men, as I said, and are not polluted, while the gods, were they to do so, should be polluted,
then the demons are less liable to pollution than the gods. And if even the demons
are contaminated, how can they help men to attain blessedness after death, if, so far from
being able to cleanse them, and present them clean to the unpolluted gods, these mediators
are themselves polluted? And if they cannot confer this benefit on men, what good can
their friendly mediation do? Or shall its result be, not that men find entrance to the gods,
but that men and demons abide together in a state of pollution, and consequently of exclusion
from blessedness? Unless, perhaps, some one may say that, like sponges or things of that
sort, the demons themselves, in the process of cleansing their friends, become themselves
the filthier in proportion as the others become clean. But if this is the solution, then the
gods, who shun contact or intercourse with men for fear of pollution, mix with demons
who are far more polluted. Or perhaps the gods, who cannot cleanse men without polluting
themselves, can without pollution cleanse the demons who have been contaminated by human
contact? Who can believe such follies, unless the demons have practised their deceit
upon him? If seeing and being seen is contamination, and if the gods, whom Apuleius
himself calls visible, “the brilliant lights of the world,”353 and the other stars, are seen by
men, are we to believe that the demons, who cannot be seen unless they please, are safer
from contamination? Or if it is only the seeing and not the being seen which contaminates,
then they must deny that these gods of theirs, these brilliant lights of the world, see men
when their rays beam upon the earth. Their rays are not contaminated by lighting on all
manner of pollution, and are we to suppose that the gods would be contaminated if they
mixed with men, and even if contact were needed in order to assist them? For there is
contact between the earth and the sun’s or moon’s rays, and yet this does not pollute the
light.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—That to Obtain the Blessed Life, Which Consists in Partaking of the
Supreme Good, Man Needs Such Mediation as is Furnished Not by a Demon,
But by Christ Alone.</head>
<p>I am considerably surprised that such learned men, men who pronounce all material
and sensible things to be altogether inferior to those that are spiritual and intelligible, should
mention bodily contact in connection with the blessed life. Is that sentiment of Plotinus
forgotten?—“We must fly to our beloved fatherland. There is the Father, there our all.
What fleet or flight shall convey us thither? Our way is, to become like God.”354 If, then,
one is nearer to God the liker he is to Him, there is no other distance from God than unlike-
ness to Him. And the soul of man is unlike that incorporeal and unchangeable and eternal
essence, in proportion as it craves things temporal and mutable. And as the things beneath,
which are mortal and impure, cannot hold intercourse with the immortal purity which is
above, a mediator is indeed needed to remove this difficulty; but not a mediator who resembles
the highest order of being by possessing an immortal body, and the lowest by having
a diseased soul, which makes him rather grudge that we be healed than help our cure. We
need a Mediator who, being united to us here below by the mortality of His body, should
at the same time be able to afford us truly divine help in cleansing and liberating us by means
of the immortal righteousness of His spirit, whereby He remained heavenly even while here
upon earth. Far be it from the incontaminable God to fear pollution from the man355 He
assumed, or from the men among whom He lived in the form of a man. For, though His
incarnation showed us nothing else, these two wholesome facts were enough, that true divinity
cannot be polluted by flesh, and that demons are not to be considered better than
ourselves because they have not flesh.356 This, then, as Scripture says, is the “Mediator
between God and man, the man Christ Jesus,”357 of whose divinity, whereby He is equal to
the Father, and humanity, whereby He has become like us, this is not the place to speak as
fully as I could.</p>

<p>As to the demons, these false and deceitful mediators, who, though their uncleanness
of spirit frequently reveals their misery and malignity, yet, by virtue of the levity of their
aerial bodies and the nature of the places they inhabit, do contrive to turn us aside and
hinder our spiritual progress; they do not help us towards God, but rather prevent us from
reaching Him. Since even in the bodily way, which is erroneous and misleading, and in
which righteousness does not walk,—for we must rise to God not by bodily ascent, but by
incorporeal or spiritual conformity to Him,—in this bodily way, I say, which the friends of
the demons arrange according to the weight of the various elements, the aerial demons being
set between the ethereal gods and earthy men, they imagine the gods to have this privilege,
that by this local interval they are preserved from the pollution of human contact. Thus
they believe that the demons are contaminated by men rather than men cleansed by the
demons, and that the gods themselves should be polluted unless their local superiority preserved
them. Who is so wretched a creature as to expect purification by a way in which
men are contaminating, demons contaminated, and gods contaminable? Who would not
rather choose that way whereby we escape the contamination of the demons, and are cleansed
from pollution by the incontaminable God, so as to be associated with the uncontaminated
angels?</p>

<p>But as some of these demonolators, as I may call them, and among them Labeo, allege
that those whom they call demons are by others called angels, I must, if I would not seem
to dispute merely about words, say something about the good angels. The Platonists do not
deny their existence, but prefer to call them good demons. But we, following Scripture, according
to which we are Christians, have learned that some of the angels are good, some
bad, but never have we read in Scripture of good demons; but wherever this or any cognate
term occurs, it is applied only to wicked spirits. And this usage has become so universal,
that, even among those who are called pagans, and who maintain that demons as well as
gods should be worshipped, there is scarcely a man, no matter how well read and learned,
who would dare to say by way of praise to his slave, You have a demon, or who could doubt
that the man to whom he said this would consider it a curse? Why, then, are we to subject
ourselves to the necessity of explaining away what we have said when we have given offence
by using the word demon, with which every one, or almost every one, connects a bad
meaning, while we can so easily evade this necessity by using the word angel?</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Of the Kind of Knowledge Which Puffs Up the Demons.</head>
<p>However, the very origin of the name suggests something worthy of consideration, if
we compare it with the divine books. They are called demons from a Greek word meaning
knowledge.358 Now the apostle, speaking with the Holy Spirit, says, “Knowledge puffeth
up, but charity buildeth up.”359 And this can only be understood as meaning that without
charity knowledge does no good, but inflates a man or magnifies him with an empty
windiness. The demons, then, have knowledge without charity, and are thereby so inflated
or proud, that they crave those divine honors and religious services which they know to be
due to the true God, and still, as far as they can, exact these from all over whom they have
influence. Against this pride of the demons, under which the human race was held subject
as its merited punishment, there was exerted the mighty influence of the humility of God,
who appeared in the form of a servant; but men, resembling the demons in pride, but not
in knowledge, and being puffed up with uncleanness, failed to recognize Him.</p>

<pb n="415"/>
<head>Chapter 21.—To What Extent the Lord Was Pleased to Make Himself Known to the
Demons.</head>
<p>The devils themselves knew this manifestation of God so well, that they said to the Lord
though clothed with the infirmity of flesh, “What have we to do with Thee, Jesus of Nazareth?
Art Thou come to destroy us before the time?”360 From these words, it is clear that they
had great knowledge, and no charity. They feared His power to punish, and did not love
His righteousness. He made known to them so much as He pleased, and He was pleased to
make known so much as was needful. But He made Himself known not as to the holy angels,
who know Him as the Word of God, and rejoice in His eternity, which they partake, but as
was requisite to strike with terror the beings from whose tyranny He was going to free those
who were predestined to His kingdom and the glory of it, eternally true and truly eternal.
He made Himself known, therefore, to the demons, not by that which is life eternal, and
the unchangeable light which illumines the pious, whose souls are cleansed by the faith that
is in Him, but by some temporal effects of His power, and evidences of His mysterious
presence, which were more easily discerned by the angelic senses even of wicked spirits than
by human infirmity. But when He judged it advisable gradually to suppress these signs, and
to retire into deeper obscurity, the prince of the demons doubted whether He were the
Christ, and endeavored to ascertain this by tempting Him, in so far as He permitted Himself
to be tempted, that He might adapt the manhood He wore to be an example for our imitation.
But after that temptation, when, as Scripture says, He was ministered to361 by the angels
who are good and holy, and therefore objects of terror to the impure spirits, He revealed
more and more distinctly to the demons how great He was, so that, even though the infirmity
of His flesh might seem contemptible, none dared to resist His authority.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—The Difference Between the Knowledge of the Holy Angels and that
of the Demons.</head>
<p>The good angels, therefore, hold cheap all that knowledge of material and transitory
things which the demons are so proud of possessing,—not that they are ignorant of these
things, but because the love of God, whereby they are sanctified, is very dear to them, and
because, in comparison of that not merely immaterial but also unchangeable and ineffable
beauty, with the holy love of which they are inflamed, they despise all things which are beneath
it, and all that is not it, that they may with every good thing that is in them enjoy that
good which is the source of their goodness. And therefore they have a more certain knowledge
even of those temporal and mutable things, because they contemplate their principles
and causes in the word of God, by which the world was made,—those causes by which one
thing is, approved, another rejected, and all arranged. But the demons do not behold in the
wisdom of God these eternal, and, as it were, cardinal causes of things temporal, but only
foresee a larger part of the future than men do, by reason of their greater acquaintance with
the signs which are hidden from us. Sometimes, too, it is their own intentions they predict.
And, finally, the demons are frequently, the angels never, deceived. For it is one thing, by
the aid of things temporal and changeable, to conjecture the changes that may occur in time,
and to modify such things by one’s own will and faculty,—and this is to a certain extent
permitted to the demons,—it is another thing to foresee the changes of times in the eternal
and immutable laws of God, which live in His wisdom, and to know the will of God, the
most infallible and powerful of all causes, by participating in His spirit; and this is granted
to the holy angels by a just discretion. And thus they are not only eternal, but blessed. And
the good wherein they are blessed is God, by whom they were created. For without end
they enjoy the contemplation and participation of Him.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—That the Name of Gods is Falsely Given to the Gods of the Gentiles,
Though Scripture Applies It Both to the Holy Angels and Just Men.</head>
<p>If the Platonists prefer to call these angels gods rather than demons, and to reckon them
with those whom Plato, their founder and master, maintains were created by the supreme
God,362 they are welcome to do so, for I will not spend strength in fighting about words.
For if they say that these beings are immortal, and yet created by the supreme God, blessed
but by cleaving to their Creator and not by their own power, they say what we say, whatever
name they call these beings by. And that this is the opinion either of all or the best of the
Platonists can be ascertained by their writings. And regarding the name itself, if they see
fit to call such blessed and immortal creatures gods, this need not give rise to any serious
discussion between us, since in our own Scriptures we read, “The God of gods, the Lord
hath spoken;”363 and again, “Confess to the God of gods;”364 and again, “He is a great King
above all gods.”365 And where it is said, “He is to be feared above all gods,” the reason is
forthwith added, for it follows, “for all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made
the heavens.”366 He said, “above all gods,” but added, “of the nations;” that is to say, above
all those whom the nations count gods, in other words, demons. By them He is to be feared
with that terror in which they cried to the Lord, “Hast Thou come to destroy us?” But where
it is said, “the God of gods,” it cannot be understood as the god of the demons; and far be
it from us to say that “great King above all gods” means “great King above all demons.” But
the same Scripture also calls men who belong to God’s people “gods:” “I have said, Ye are
gods, and all of you children of the Most High.”367 Accordingly, when God is styled God
of gods, this may be understood of these gods; and so, too, when He is styled a great King
above all gods.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some one may say, if men are called gods because they belong to God’s
people, whom He addresses by means of men and angels, are not the immortals, who already
enjoy that felicity which men seek to attain by worshipping God, much more worthy of the
title? And what shall we reply to this, if not that it is not without reason that in holy Scripture
men are more expressly styled gods than those immortal and blessed spirits to whom we
hope to be equal in the resurrection, because there was a fear that the weakness of unbelief,
being overcome with the excellence of these beings, might presume to constitute some of
them a god? In the case of men this was a result that need not be guarded against. Besides,

<pb n="418"/>
it was right that the men belonging to God’s people should be more expressly called gods,
to assure and certify them that He who is called God of gods is their God; because, although
those immortal and blessed spirits who dwell in the heavens are called gods, yet they are
not called gods of gods, that is to say, gods of the men who constitute God’s people, and to
whom it is said, “I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you the children of the Most High.”
Hence the saying of the apostle, “Though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven
or in earth, as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but one God, the
Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by Him.”368</p>
<p>We need not, therefore, laboriously contend about the name, since the reality is so obvious
as to admit of no shadow of doubt. That which we say, that the angels who are sent
to announce the will of God to men belong to the order of blessed immortals, does not satisfy
the Platonists, because they believe that this ministry is discharged, not by those whom
they call gods, in other words, not by blessed immortals, but by demons, whom they dare
not affirm to be blessed, but only immortal, or if they do rank them among the blessed immortals,
yet only as good demons, and not as gods who dwell in the heaven of heavens remote
from all human contact. But, though it may seem mere wrangling about a name, yet the
name of demon is so detestable that we cannot bear in any sense to apply it to the holy angels.
Now, therefore, let us close this book in the assurance that, whatever we call these immortal
and blessed spirits, who yet are only creatures, they do not act as mediators to introduce to
everlasting felicity miserable mortals, from whom they are severed by a twofold distinction.
And those others who are mediators, in so far as they have immortality in common with
their superiors, and misery in common with their inferiors (for they are justly miserable in
punishment of their wickedness), cannot bestow upon us, but rather grudge that we should
possess, the blessedness from which they themselves are excluded. And so the friends of
the demons have nothing considerable to allege why we should rather worship them as our
helpers than avoid them as traitors to our interests. As for those spirits who are good, and
who are therefore not only immortal but also blessed, and to whom they suppose we should
give the title of gods, and offer worship and sacrifices for the sake of inheriting a future life,
we shall, by God’s help, endeavor in the following book to show that these spirits, call them
by what name, and ascribe to them what nature you will, desire that religious worship be
paid to God alone, by whom they were created, and by whose communications of Himself
to them they are blessed.</p>

<p>It is the decided opinion of all who use their brains, that all men desire to be happy.
But who are happy, or how they become so, these are questions about which the weakness
of human understanding stirs endless and angry controversies, in which philosophers have
wasted their strength and expended their leisure. To adduce and discuss their various
opinions would be tedious, and is unnecessary. The reader may remember what we said in
the eighth book, while making a selection of the philosophers with whom we might discuss
the question regarding the future life of happiness, whether we can reach it by paying divine
honors to the one true God, the Creator of all gods, or by worshipping many gods, and he
will not expect us to repeat here the same argument, especially as, even if he has forgotten
it, he may refresh his memory by reperusal. For we made selection of the Platonists, justly
esteemed the noblest of the philosophers, because they had the wit to perceive that the human
soul, immortal and rational, or intellectual, as it is, cannot be happy except by partaking of
the light of that God by whom both itself and the world were made; and also that the happy
life which all men desire cannot be reached by any who does not cleave with a pure and holy
love to that one supreme good, the unchangeable God. But as even these philosophers,
whether accommodating to the folly and ignorance of the people, or, as the apostle says,
“becoming vain in their imaginations,”369 supposed or allowed others to suppose that many
gods should be worshipped, so that some of them considered that divine honor by worship
and sacrifice should be rendered even to the demons (an error I have already exploded), we
must now, by God’s help, ascertain what is thought about our religious worship and piety
by those immortal and blessed spirits, who dwell in the heavenly places among dominations,
principalities, powers, whom the Platonists call gods, and some either good demons, or, like
us, angels,—that is to say, to put it more plainly, whether the angels desire us to offer sacrifice
and worship, and to consecrate our possessions and ourselves, to them or only to God, theirs
and ours.</p>
<p>For this is the worship which is due to the Divinity, or, to speak more accurately, to the
Deity; and, to express this worship in a single word as there does not occur to me any Latin
term sufficiently exact, I shall avail myself, whenever necessary, of a Greek word. Λατρεία,
whenever it occurs in Scripture, is rendered by the word service. But that service which is
due to men, and in reference to which the apostle writes that servants must be subject to
<note type="footnote">369 Rom. i. 21.</note>

<pb n="421"/>
their own masters,370 is usually designated by another word in Greek,371 whereas the service
which is paid to God alone by worship, is always, or almost always, called λατρεία in the
usage of those who wrote from the divine oracles. This cannot so well be called simply
“cultus,” for in that case it would not seem to be due exclusively to God; for the same word
is applied to the respect we pay either to the memory or the living presence of men. From
it, too, we derive the words agriculture, colonist, and others.372 And the heathen call their
gods “coelicolæ,” not because they worship heaven, but because they dwell in it, and as it
were colonize it,—not in the sense in which we call those colonists who are attached to their
native soil to cultivate it under the rule of the owners, but in the sense in which the great
master of the Latin language says, “There was an ancient city inhabited by Tyrian colonists.”
373 He called them colonists, not because they cultivated the soil, but because they inhabited
the city. So, too, cities that have hived off from larger cities are called colonies.
Consequently, while it is quite true that, using the word in a special sense, “cult” can be
rendered to none but God, yet, as the word is applied to other things besides, the cult due
to God cannot in Latin be expressed by this word alone.</p>
<p>The word “religion” might seem to express more definitely the worship due to God
alone, and therefore Latin translators have used this word to represent θρησκεία; yet, as not
only the uneducated, but also the best instructed, use the word religion to express human
ties, and relationships, and affinities, it would inevitably introduce ambiguity to use this
word in discussing the worship of God, unable as we are to say that religion is nothing else
than the worship of God, without contradicting the common usage which applies this word
to the observance of social relationships. “Piety,” again, or, as the Greeks say, εὐσέβεια, is
commonly understood as the proper designation of the worship of God. Yet this word also
is used of dutifulness to parents. The common people, too, use it of works of charity, which,
I suppose, arises from the circumstance that God enjoins the performance of such works,
and declares that He is pleased with them instead of, or in preference to sacrifices. From
this usage it has also come to pass that God Himself is called pious,374 in which sense the
Greeks never use εὐσεβεῖν, though εὐσέβεια is applied to works of charity by their common
people also. In some passages of Scripture, therefore, they have sought to preserve the distinction
by using not εὐσέβεια, the more general word, but θεοσέβεια, which literally denotes
the worship of God. We, on the other hand, cannot express either of these ideas by one
word. This worship, then, which in Greek is called λατρεία, and in Latin “servitus” [service],

but the service due to God only; this worship, which in Greek is called θρησκεία, and in
Latin “religio,” but the religion by which we are bound to God only; this worship, which
they call θεοσέβεια, but which we cannot express in one word, but call it the worship of
God,—this, we say, belongs only to that God who is the true God, and who makes His
worshippers gods.375 And therefore, whoever these immortal and blessed inhabitants of
heaven be, if they do not love us, and wish us to be blessed, then we ought not to worship
them; and if they do love us and desire our happiness, they cannot wish us to be made happy
by any other means than they themselves have enjoyed,—for how could they wish our
blessedness to flow from one source, theirs from another?</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—The Opinion of Plotinus the Platonist Regarding Enlightenment from
Above.</head>
<p>But with these more estimable philosophers we have no dispute in this matter. For they
perceived, and in various forms abundantly expressed in their writings, that these spirits
have the same source of happiness as ourselves,—a certain intelligible light, which is their
God, and is different from themselves, and illumines them that they may be penetrated with
light, and enjoy perfect happiness in the participation of God. Plotinus, commenting on
Plato, repeatedly and strongly asserts that not even the soul which they believe to be the
soul of the world, derives its blessedness from any other source than we do, viz., from that
Light which is distinct from it and created it, and by whose intelligible illumination it enjoys
light in things intelligible. He also compares those spiritual things to the vast and conspicuous
heavenly bodies, as if God were the sun, and the soul the moon; for they suppose that the
moon derives its light from the sun. That great Platonist, therefore, says that the rational
soul, or rather the intellectual soul,—in which class he comprehends the souls of the blessed
immortals who inhabit heaven,—has no nature superior to it save God, the Creator of the
world and the soul itself, and that these heavenly spirits derive their blessed life, and the
light of truth from their blessed life, and the light of truth, the source as ourselves, agreeing
with the gospel where we read, “There was a man sent from God whose name was John; the
same came for a witness to bear witness of that Light, that through Him all might believe.
He was not that Light, but that he might bear witness of the Light. That was the true Light
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world;”376 a distinction which sufficiently
proves that the rational or intellectual soul such as John had cannot be its own light, but
needs to receive illumination from another, the true Light. This John himself avows when
he delivers his witness: “We have all received of His fullness.”377</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—That the Platonists, Though Knowing Something of the Creator of the
Universe, Have Misunderstood the True Worship of God, by Giving Divine
Honor to Angels, Good or Bad.</head>
<p>This being so, if the Platonists, or those who think with them, knowing God, glorified
Him as God and gave thanks, if they did not become vain in their own thoughts, if they did
not originate or yield to the popular errors, they would certainly acknowledge that neither
could the blessed immortals retain, nor we miserable mortals reach, a happy condition
without worshipping the one God of gods, who is both theirs and ours. To Him we owe
the service which is called in Greek λατρεία, whether we render it outwardly or inwardly;
for we are all His temple, each of us severally and all of us together, because He condescends
to inhabit each individually and the whole harmonious body, being no greater in all than
in each, since He is neither expanded nor divided. Our heart when it rises to Him is His
altar; the priest who intercedes for us is His Only-begotten; we sacrifice to Him bleeding
victims when we contend for His truth even unto blood; to Him we offer the sweetest incense
when we come before Him burning with holy and pious love; to Him we devote and surrender
ourselves and His gifts in us; to Him, by solemn feasts and on appointed days, we consecrate
the memory of His benefits, lest through the lapse of time ungrateful oblivion should steal
upon us; to Him we offer on the altar of our heart the sacrifice of humility and praise, kindled
by the fire of burning love. It is that we may see Him, so far as He can be seen; it is that we
may cleave to Him, that we are cleansed from all stain of sins and evil passions, and are
consecrated in His name. For He is the fountain of our happiness, He the end of all our
desires. Being attached to Him, or rather let me say, re-attached,—for we had detached
ourselves and lost hold of Him,—being, I say, re-attached to Him,378 we tend towards Him
by love, that we may rest in Him, and find our blessedness by attaining that end. For our
good, about which philosophers have so keenly contended, is nothing else than to be united
to God. It is, if I may say so, by spiritually embracing Him that the intellectual soul is filled
and impregnated with true virtues. We are enjoined to love this good with all our heart,
with all our soul, with all our strength. To this good we ought to be led by those who love
us, and to lead those we love. Thus are fulfilled those two commandments on which hang
all the law and the prophets: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy mind, and with all thy soul;” and “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”379 For,
that man might be intelligent in his self-love, there was appointed for him an end to which
he might refer all his actions, that he might be blessed. For he who loves himself wishes

nothing else than this. And the end set before him is “to draw near to God.”380 And so,
when one who has this intelligent self-love is commanded to love his neighbor as himself,
what else is enjoined than that he shall do all in his power to commend to him the love of
God? This is the worship of God, this is true religion, this right piety, this the service due
to God only. If any immortal power, then, no matter with what virtue endowed, loves us
as himself, he must desire that we find our happiness by submitting ourselves to Him, in
submission to whom he himself finds happiness. If he does not worship God, he is wretched,
because deprived of God; if he worships God, he cannot wish to be worshipped in God’s
stead. On the contrary, these higher powers acquiesce heartily in the divine sentence in
which it is written, “He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be
utterly destroyed.”381</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—That Sacrifice is Due to the True God Only.</head>
<p>But, putting aside for the present the other religious services with which God is worshipped,
certainly no man would dare to say that sacrifice is due to any but God. Many
parts, indeed, of divine worship are unduly used in showing honor to men, whether through
an excessive humility or pernicious flattery; yet, while this is done, those persons who are
thus worshipped and venerated, or even adored, are reckoned no more than human; and
who ever thought of sacrificing save to one whom he knew, supposed, or feigned to be a
god? And how ancient a part of God’s worship sacrifice is, those two brothers, Cain and
Abel, sufficiently show, of whom God rejected the elder’s sacrifice, and looked favorably on
the younger’s.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of the Sacrifices Which God Does Not Require, But Wished to Be Observed
for the Exhibition of Those Things Which He Does Require.</head>
<p>And who is so foolish as to suppose that the things offered to God are needed by Him
for some uses of His own? Divine Scripture in many places explodes this idea. Not to be
wearisome, suffice it to quote this brief saying from a psalm: “I have said to the Lord, Thou
art my God: for Thou needest not my goodness.”382 We must believe, then, that God has
no need, not only of cattle, or any other earthly and material thing, but even of man’s
righteousness, and that whatever right worship is paid to God profits not Him, but man.
For no man would say he did a benefit to a fountain by drinking, or to the light by seeing.
And the fact that the ancient church offered animal sacrifices, which the people of God nowa-
days read of without imitating, proves nothing else than this, that those sacrifices signified
the things which we do for the purpose of drawing near to God, and inducing our neighbor
to do the same. A sacrifice, therefore, is the visible sacrament or sacred sign of an invisible
sacrifice. Hence that penitent in the psalm, or it may be the Psalmist himself, entreating
God to be merciful to his sins, says, “If Thou desiredst sacrifice, I would give it: Thou delightest
not in whole burnt-offerings. The sacrifice of God is a broken heart: a heart contrite
and humble God will not despise.”383 Observe how, in the very words in which he is expressing
God’s refusal of sacrifice, he shows that God requires sacrifice. He does not desire
the sacrifice of a slaughtered beast, but He desires the sacrifice of a contrite heart. Thus,
that sacrifice which he says God does not wish, is the symbol of the sacrifice which God
does wish. God does not wish sacrifices in the sense in which foolish people think He wishes
them, viz., to gratify His own pleasure. For if He had not wished that the sacrifices He requires,
as, e.g., a heart contrite and humbled by penitent sorrow, should be symbolized by
those sacrifices which He was thought to desire because pleasant to Himself, the old law
would never have enjoined their presentation; and they were destined to be merged when
the fit opportunity arrived, in order that men might not suppose that the sacrifices themselves,
rather than the things symbolized by them, were pleasing to God or acceptable in us. Hence,
in another passage from another psalm, he says, “If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for
the world is mine and the fullness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood
of goats?”384 as if He should say, Supposing such things were necessary to me, I would
never ask thee for what I have in my own hand. Then he goes on to mention what these
signify: “Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High. And
call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me.”385 So in

another prophet: “Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the High
God? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the
Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give
my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? Hath He
showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly,
and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?”386 In the words of this prophet,
these two things are distinguished and set forth with sufficient explicitness, that God does
not require these sacrifices for their own sakes, and that He does require the sacrifices which
they symbolize. In the epistle entitled “To the Hebrews” it is said, “To do good and to
communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”387 And so, when it
is written, “I desire mercy rather than sacrifice,”388 nothing else is meant than that one
sacrifice is preferred to another; for that which in common speech is called sacrifice is only
the symbol of the true sacrifice. Now mercy is the true sacrifice, and therefore it is said, as
I have just quoted, “with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” All the divine ordinances,
therefore, which we read concerning the sacrifices in the service of the tabernacle or the
temple, we are to refer to the love of God and our neighbor. For “on these two commandments,”
as it is written, “hang all the law and the prophets.”389</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Of the True and Perfect Sacrifice.</head>
<p>Thus a true sacrifice is every work which is done that we may be united to God in holy
fellowship, and which has a reference to that supreme good and end in which alone we can
be truly blessed.390 And therefore even the mercy we show to men, if it is not shown for
God’s sake, is not a sacrifice. For, though made or offered by man, sacrifice is a divine thing,
as those who called it sacrifice391 meant to indicate. Thus man himself, consecrated in the
name of God, and vowed to God, is a sacrifice in so far as he dies to the world that he may
live to God. For this is a part of that mercy which each man shows to himself; as it is written,
“Have mercy on thy soul by pleasing God.”392 Our body, too, as a sacrifice when we chasten
it by temperance, if we do so as we ought, for God’s sake, that we may not yield our members
instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but instruments of righteousness unto God.393
Exhorting to this sacrifice, the apostle says, “I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercy
of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your
reasonable service.”394 If, then, the body, which, being inferior, the soul uses as a servant
or instrument, is a sacrifice when it is used rightly, and with reference to God, how much
more does the soul itself become a sacrifice when it offers itself to God, in order that, being
inflamed by the fire of His love, it may receive of His beauty and become pleasing to Him,
losing the shape of earthly desire, and being remoulded in the image of permanent loveliness?
And this, indeed, the apostle subjoins, saying, “And be not conformed to this world; but be
ye transformed in the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,
and perfect will of God.”395 Since, therefore, true sacrifices are works of mercy to
ourselves or others, done with a reference to God, and since works of mercy have no other
object than the relief of distress or the conferring of happiness, and since there is no happiness
apart from that good of which it is said, “It is good for me to be very near to God,”396 it
follows that the whole redeemed city, that is to say, the congregation or community of the
saints, is offered to God as our sacrifice through the great High Priest, who offered Himself
to God in His passion for us, that we might be members of this glorious head, according to
the form of a servant. For it was this form He offered, in this He was offered, because it is
according to it He is Mediator, in this He is our Priest, in this the Sacrifice. Accordingly,
when the apostle had exhorted us to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable

in the renewing of our mind, that we might prove what is that good, and acceptable, and
perfect will of God, that is to say, the true sacrifice of ourselves, he says, “For I say, through
the grace of God which is given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of
himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath
dealt to every man the measure of faith. For, as we have many members in one body, and
all members have not the same office, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every
one members one of another, having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to
us.”397 This is the sacrifice of Christians: we, being many, are one body in Christ. And this
also is the sacrifice which the Church continually celebrates in the sacrament of the altar,
known to the faithful, in which she teaches that she herself is offered in the offering she
makes to God.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Of the Miracles Which God Has Condescended to Adhibit Through
the Ministry of Angels, to His Promises for the Confirmation of the Faith of the
Godly.</head>
<p>I should seem tedious were I to recount all the ancient miracles, which were wrought
in attestation of God’s promises which He made to Abraham thousands of years ago, that
in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed.400 For who can but marvel that
Abraham’s barren wife should have given birth to a son at an age when not even a prolific
woman could bear children; or, again, that when Abraham sacrificed, a flame from heaven
should have run between the divided parts;401 or that the angels in human form, whom he
had hospitably entertained, and who had renewed God’s promise of offspring, should also
have predicted the destruction of Sodom by fire from heaven;402 and that his nephew Lot
should have been rescued from Sodom by the angels as the fire was just descending, while
his wife, who looked back as she went, and was immediately turned into salt, stood as a
sacred beacon warning us that no one who is being saved should long for what he is leaving?
How striking also were the wonders done by Moses to rescue God’s people from the yoke
of slavery in Egypt, when the magi of the Pharaoh, that is, the king of Egypt, who tyrannized
over this people, were suffered to do some wonderful things that they might be vanquished
all the more signally! They did these things by the magical arts and incantations to which
the evil spirits or demons are addicted; while Moses, having as much greater power as he
had right on his side, and having the aid of angels, easily conquered them in the name of
the Lord who made heaven and earth. And, in fact, the magicians failed at the third plague;
whereas Moses, dealing out the miracles delegated to him, brought ten plagues upon the
land, so that the hard hearts of Pharaoh and the Egyptians yielded, and the people were let
go. But, quickly repenting, and essaying to overtake the departing Hebrews, who had crossed
the sea on dry ground, they were covered and overwhelmed in the returning waters. What
shall I say of those frequent and stupendous exhibitions of divine power, while the people
were conducted through the wilderness?—of the waters which could not be drunk, but lost
their bitterness, and quenched the thirsty, when at God’s command a piece of wood was
cast into them? of the manna that descended from heaven to appease their hunger, and
which begat worms and putrefied when any one collected more than the appointed quantity,
and yet, though double was gathered on the day before the Sabbath (it not being lawful to
gather it on that day), remained fresh? of the birds which filled the camp, and turned appetite

destruction of death by death? It was this serpent which was preserved in memory of this
event, and was afterwards worshipped by the mistaken people as an idol, and was destroyed

<head>Chapter 9.—Of the Illicit Arts Connected with Demonolatry, and of Which the
Platonist Porphyry Adopts Some, and Discards Others.</head>
<p>These miracles, and many others of the same nature, which it were tedious to mention,
were wrought for the purpose of commending the worship of the one true God, and prohibiting
the worship of a multitude of false gods. Moreover, they were wrought by simple faith
and godly confidence, not by the incantations and charms composed under the influence
of a criminal tampering with the unseen world, of an art which they call either magic, or by
the more abominable title necromancy,403 or the more honorable designation theurgy; for
they wish to discriminate between those whom the people call magicians, who practise
necromancy, and are addicted to illicit arts and condemned, and those others who seem to
them to be worthy of praise for their practice of theurgy,—the truth, however, being that
both classes are the slaves of the deceitful rites of the demons whom they invoke under the
names of angels.</p>
<p>For even Porphyry promises some kind of purgation of the soul by the help of theurgy,
though he does so with some hesitation and shame, and denies that this art can secure to
any one a return to God; so that you can detect his opinion vacillating between the profession
of philosophy and an art which he feels to be presumptuous and sacrilegious. For at one
time he warns us to avoid it as deceitful, and prohibited by law, and dangerous to those who
practise it; then again, as if in deference to its advocates, he declares it useful for cleansing
one part of the soul, not, indeed, the intellectual part, by which the truth of things intelligible,
which have no sensible images, is recognized, but the spiritual part, which takes cognizance
of the images of things material. This part, he says, is prepared and fitted for intercourse
with spirits and angels, and for the vision of the gods, by the help of certain theurgic consecrations,
or, as they call them, mysteries. He acknowledges, however, that these theurgic
mysteries impart to the intellectual soul no such purity as fits it to see its God, and recognize
the things that truly exist. And from this acknowledgment we may infer what kind of gods
these are, and what kind of vision of them is imparted by theurgic consecrations, if by it one
cannot see the things which truly exist. He says, further, that the rational, or, as he prefers
calling it, the intellectual soul, can pass into the heavens without the spiritual part being
cleansed by theurgic art, and that this art cannot so purify the spiritual part as to give it entrance
to immortality and eternity. And therefore, although he distinguishes angels from
demons, asserting that the habitation of the latter is in the air, while the former dwell in the
ether and empyrean, and although he advises us to cultivate the friendship of some demon,
who may be able after our death to assist us, and elevate us at least a little above the earth,—for
he owns that it is by another way we must reach the heavenly society of the angels,—he at
the same time distinctly warns us to avoid the society of demons, saying that the soul, expi-
<note type="footnote">403 Goetia.</note>

<pb n="435"/>
ating its sin after death, execrates the worship of demons by whom it was entangled. And
of theurgy itself, though he recommends it as reconciling angels and demons, he cannot
deny that it treats with powers which either themselves envy the soul its purity, or serve the
arts of those who do envy it. He complains of this through the mouth of some Chaldæan
or other: “A good man in Chaldæa complains,” he says, “that his most strenuous efforts to
cleanse his soul were frustrated, because another man, who had influence in these matters,
and who envied him purity, had prayed to the powers, and bound them by his conjuring
not to listen to his request. Therefore,” adds Porphyry, “what the one man bound, the other
could not loose.” And from this he concludes that theurgy is a craft which accomplishes
not only good but evil among gods and men; and that the gods also have passions, and are
perturbed and agitated by the emotions which Apuleius attributed to demons and men, but
from which he preserved the gods by that sublimity of residence, which, in common with
Plato, he accorded to them.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Concerning Theurgy, Which Promises a Delusive Purification of the
Soul by the Invocation of Demons.</head>
<p>But here we have another and a much more learned Platonist than Apuleius, Porphyry,
to wit, asserting that, by I know not what theurgy, even the gods themselves are subjected
to passions and perturbations; for by adjurations they were so bound and terrified that they
could not confer purity of soul,—were so terrified by him who imposed on them a wicked
command, that they could not by the same theurgy be freed from that terror, and fulfill the
righteous behest of him who prayed to them, or do the good he sought. Who does not see
that all these things are fictions of deceiving demons, unless he be a wretched slave of theirs,
and an alien from the grace of the true Liberator? For if the Chaldæan had been dealing
with good gods, certainly a well-disposed man, who sought to purify his own soul, would
have had more influence with them than an evil-disposed man seeking to hinder him. Or,
if the gods were just, and considered the man unworthy of the purification he sought, at all
events they should not have been terrified by an envious person, nor hindered, as Porphyry
avows, by the fear of a stronger deity, but should have simply denied the boon on their own
free judgment. And it is surprising that that well-disposed Chaldæan, who desired to purify
his soul by theurgical rites, found no superior deity who could either terrify the frightened
gods still more, and force them to confer the boon, or compose their fears, and so enable
them to do good without compulsion,—even supposing that the good theurgist had no rites
by which he himself might purge away the taint of fear from the gods whom he invoked for
the purification of his own soul. And why is it that there is a god who has power to terrify
the inferior gods, and none who has power to free them from fear? Is there found a god
who listens to the envious man, and frightens the gods from doing good? and is there not
found a god who listens to the well-disposed man, and removes the fear of the gods that
they may do him good? O excellent theurgy! O admirable purification of the soul!—a theurgy
in which the violence of an impure envy has more influence than the entreaty of purity and
holiness. Rather let us abominate and avoid the deceit of such wicked spirits, and listen to
sound doctrine. As to those who perform these filthy cleansings by sacrilegious rites, and
see in their initiated state (as he further tells us, though we may question this vision) certain
wonderfully lovely appearances of angels or gods, this is what the apostle refers to when he
speaks of “Satan transforming himself into an angel of light.”404 For these are the delusive
appearances of that spirit who longs to entangle wretched souls in the deceptive worship of
many and false gods, and to turn them aside from the true worship of the true God, by
whom alone they are cleansed and healed, and who, as was said of Proteus, “turns himself

<head>Chapter 11.—Of Porphyry’s Epistle to Anebo, in Which He Asks for Information
About the Differences Among Demons.</head>
<p>It was a better tone which Porphyry adopted in his letter to Anebo the Egyptian, in
which, assuming the character of an inquirer consulting him, he unmasks and explodes
these sacrilegious arts. In that letter, indeed, he repudiates all demons, whom he maintains
to be so foolish as to be attracted by the sacrificial vapors, and therefore residing not in the
ether, but in the air beneath the moon, and indeed in the moon itself. Yet he has not the
boldness to attribute to all the demons all the deceptions and malicious and foolish practices
which justly move his indignation. For, though he acknowledges that as a race demons are
foolish, he so far accommodates himself to popular ideas as to call some of them benignant
demons. He expresses surprise that sacrifices not only incline the gods, but also compel
and force them to do what men wish; and he is at a loss to understand how the sun and
moon, and other visible celestial bodies,—for bodies he does not doubt that they are,—are
considered gods, if the gods are distinguished from the demons by their incorporeality; also,
if they are gods, how some are called beneficent and others hurtful, and how they, being
corporeal, are numbered with the gods, who are incorporeal. He inquires further, and still
as one in doubt, whether diviners and wonderworkers are men of unusually powerful souls,
or whether the power to do these things is communicated by spirits from without. He inclines
to the latter opinion, on the ground that it is by the use of stones and herbs that they lay
spells on people, and open closed doors, and do similar wonders. And on this account, he
says, some suppose that there is a race of beings whose property it is to listen to men,—a
race deceitful, full of contrivances, capable of assuming all forms, simulating gods, demons,
and dead men,—and that it is this race which bring about all these things which have the
appearance of good or evil, but that what is really good they never help us in, and are indeed
unacquainted with, for they make wickedness easy, but throw obstacles in the path of those
who eagerly follow virtue; and that they are filled with pride and rashness, delight in sacrificial
odors, are taken with flattery. These and the other characteristics of this race of deceitful
and malicious spirits, who come into the souls of men and delude their senses, both in sleep
and waking, he describes not as things of which he is himself convinced, but only with so
much suspicion and doubt as to cause him to speak of them as commonly received opinions.
We should sympathize with this great philosopher in the difficulty he experienced in acquainting
himself with and confidently assailing the whole fraternity of devils, which any
Christian old woman would unhesitatingly describe and most unreservedly detest. Perhaps,
however, he shrank from offending Anebo, to whom he was writing, himself the most eminent
patron of these mysteries, or the others who marvelled at these magical feats as divine
works, and closely allied to the worship of the gods.</p>
<p>However, he pursues this subject, and, still in the character of an inquirer, mentions
some things which no sober judgment could attribute to any but malicious and deceitful

<pb n="439"/>
powers. He asks why, after the better class of spirits have been invoked, the worse should
be commanded to perform the wicked desires of men; why they do not hear a man who has
just left a woman’s embrace, while they themselves make no scruple of tempting men to
incest and adultery; why their priests are commanded to abstain from animal food for fear
of being polluted by the corporeal exhalations, while they themselves are attracted by the
fumes of sacrifices and other exhalations; why the initiated are forbidden to touch a dead
body, while their mysteries are celebrated almost entirely by means of dead bodies; why it
is that a man addicted to any vice should utter threats, not to a demon or to the soul of a
dead man, but to the sun and moon, or some of the heavenly bodies, which he intimidates
by imaginary terrors, that he may wring from them a real boon,—for he threatens that he
will demolish the sky, and such like impossibilities,—that those gods, being alarmed, like
silly children, with imaginary and absurd threats, may do what they are ordered. Porphyry
further relates that a man, Chæremon, profoundly versed in these sacred or rather sacrilegious
mysteries, had written that the famous Egyptian mysteries of Isis and her husband Osiris
had very great influence with the gods to compel them to do what they were ordered, when
he who used the spells threatened to divulge or do away with these mysteries, and cried with
a threatening voice that he would scatter the members of Osiris if they neglected his orders.
Not without reason is Porphyry surprised that a man should utter such wild and empty
threats against the gods,—not against gods of no account, but against the heavenly gods,
and those that shine with sidereal light,—and that these threats should be effectual to constrain
them with resistless power, and alarm them so that they fulfill his wishes. Not without
reason does he, in the character of an inquirer into the reasons of these surprising things,
give it to be understood that they are done by that race of spirits which he previously described
as if quoting other people’s opinions,—spirits who deceive not, as he said, by nature,
but by their own corruption, and who simulate gods and dead men, but not, as he said,
demons, for demons they really are. As to his idea that by means of herbs, and stones, and
animals, and certain incantations and noises, and drawings, sometimes fanciful, and sometimes
copied from the motions of the heavenly bodies, men create upon earth powers capable
of bringing about various results, all that is only the mystification which these demons
practise on those who are subject to them, for the sake of furnishing themselves with merriment
at the expense of their dupes. Either, then, Porphyry was sincere in his doubts and
inquiries, and mentioned these things to demonstrate and put beyond question that they
were the work, not of powers which aid us in obtaining life, but of deceitful demons; or, to
take a more favorable view of the philosopher, he adopted this method with the Egyptian
who was wedded to these errors, and was proud of them, that he might not offend him by
assuming the attitude of a teacher, nor discompose his mind by the altercation of a professed
assailant, but, by assuming the character of an inquirer, and the humble attitude of one who
was anxious to learn, might turn his attention to these matters, and show how worthy they

<pb n="440"/>
are to be despised and relinquished. Towards the conclusion of his letter, he requests Anebo
to inform him what the Egyptian wisdom indicates as the way to blessedness. But as to
those who hold intercourse with the gods, and pester them only for the sake of finding a
runaway slave, or acquiring property, or making a bargain of a marriage, or such things, he
declares that their pretensions to wisdom are vain. He adds that these same gods, even
granting that on other points their utterances were true, were yet so ill-advised and unsatisfactory
in their disclosures about blessedness, that they cannot be either gods or good
demons, but are either that spirit who is called the deceiver, or mere fictions of the imagination.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Of the Miracles Wrought by the True God Through the Ministry of
the Holy Angels.</head>
<p>Since by means of these arts wonders are done which quite surpass human power, what
choice have we but to believe that these predictions and operations, which seem to be miraculous
and divine, and which at the same time form no part of the worship of the one God,
in adherence to whom, as the Platonists themselves abundantly testify, all blessedness consists,
are the pastime of wicked spirits, who thus seek to seduce and hinder the truly godly? On
the other hand, we cannot but believe that all miracles, whether wrought by angels or by
other means, so long as they are so done as to commend the worship and religion of the
one God in whom alone is blessedness, are wrought by those who love us in a true and godly
sort, or through their means, God Himself working in them. For we cannot listen to those
who maintain that the invisible God works no visible miracles; for even they believe that
He made the world, which surely they will not deny to be visible. Whatever marvel happens
in this world, it is certainly less marvellous than this whole world itself,—I mean the sky
and earth, and all that is in them,—and these God certainly made. But, as the Creator
Himself is hidden and incomprehensible to man, so also is the manner of creation. Although,
therefore, the standing miracle of this visible world is little thought of, because always before
us, yet, when we arouse ourselves to contemplate it, it is a greater miracle than the rarest
and most unheard-of marvels. For man himself is a greater miracle than any miracle done
through his instrumentality. Therefore God, who made the visible heaven and earth, does
not disdain to work visible miracles in heaven or earth, that He may thereby awaken the
soul which is immersed in things visible to worship Himself, the Invisible. But the place
and time of these miracles are dependent on His unchangeable will, in which things future
are ordered as if already they were accomplished. For He moves things temporal without
Himself moving in time, He does not in one way know things that are to be, and, in another,
things that have been; neither does He listen to those who pray otherwise than as He sees
those that will pray. For, even when His angels hear us, it is He Himself who hears us in
them, as in His true temple not made with hands, as in those men who are His saints; and
His answers, though accomplished in time, have been arranged by His eternal appointment.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Of the Invisible God, Who Has Often Made Himself Visible, Not as
He Really Is, But as the Beholders Could Bear the Sight.</head>
<p>Neither need we be surprised that God, invisible as He is, should often have appeared
visibly to the patriarchs. For as the sound which communicates the thought conceived in
the silence of the mind is not the thought itself, so the form by which God, invisible in His
own nature, became visible, was not God Himself. Nevertheless it is He Himself who was
seen under that form, as that thought itself is heard in the sound of the voice; and the patriarchs
recognized that, though the bodily form was not God, they saw the invisible God.
For, though Moses conversed with God, yet he said, “If I have found grace in Thy sight,
show me Thyself, that I may see and know Thee.”406 And as it was fit that the law, which
was given, not to one man or a few enlightened men, but to the whole of a populous nation,
should be accompanied by awe-inspiring signs, great marvels were wrought, by the ministry
of angels, before the people on the mount where the law was being given to them through
one man, while the multitude beheld the awful appearances. For the people of Israel believed
Moses, not as the Lacedæmonians believed their Lycurgus, because he had received from
Jupiter or Apollo the laws he gave them. For when the law which enjoined the worship of
one God was given to the people, marvellous signs and earthquakes, such as the divine
wisdom judged sufficient, were brought about in the sight of all, that they might know that
it was the Creator who could thus use creation to promulgate His law.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—That the One God is to Be Worshipped Not Only for the Sake of
Eternal Blessings, But Also in Connection with Temporal Prosperity, Because
All Things are Regulated by His Providence.</head>
<p>The education of the human race, represented by the people of God, has advanced, like
that of an individual, through certain epochs, or, as it were, ages, so that it might gradually
rise from earthly to heavenly things, and from the visible to the invisible. This object was
kept so clearly in view, that, even in the period when temporal rewards were promised, the
one God was presented as the object of worship, that men might not acknowledge any other
than the true Creator and Lord of the spirit, even in connection with the earthly blessings
of this transitory life. For he who denies that all things, which either angels or men can give
us, are in the hand of the one Almighty, is a madman. The Platonist Plotinus discourses
concerning providence, and, from the beauty of flowers and foliage, proves that from the
supreme God, whose beauty is unseen and ineffable, providence reaches down even to these
earthly things here below; and he argues that all these frail and perishing things could not
have so exquisite and elaborate a beauty, were they not fashioned by Him whose unseen
and unchangeable beauty continually pervades all things.407 This is proved also by the Lord
Jesus, where He says, “Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.
And yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But
if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven,
how much more shall He clothe you, O ye of little faith.!”408 It was best, therefore, that the
soul of man, which was still weakly desiring earthly things, should be accustomed to seek
from God alone even these petty temporal boons, and the earthly necessaries of this transitory
life, which are contemptible in comparison with eternal blessings, in order that the desire
even of these things might not draw it aside from the worship of Him, to whom we come
by despising and forsaking such things.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Of the Ministry of the Holy Angels, by Which They Fulfill the
Providence of God.</head>
<p>And so it has pleased Divine Providence, as I have said, and as we read in the Acts of
the Apostles,409 that the law enjoining the worship of one God should be given by the disposition
of angels. But among them the person of God Himself visibly appeared, not, indeed,
in His proper substance, which ever remains invisible to mortal eyes, but by the infallible
signs furnished by creation in obedience to its Creator. He made use, too, of the words of
human speech, uttering them syllable by syllable successively, though in His own nature He
speaks not in a bodily but in a spiritual way; not to sense, but to the mind; not in words that
occupy time, but, if I may so say, eternally, neither beginning to speak nor coming to an
end. And what He says is accurately heard, not by the bodily but by the mental ear of His
ministers and messengers, who are immortally blessed in the enjoyment of His unchangeable
truth; and the directions which they in some ineffable way receive, they execute without
delay or difficulty in the sensible and visible world. And this law was given in conformity
with the age of the world, and contained at the first earthly promises, as I have said, which,
however, symbolized eternal ones; and these eternal blessings few understood, though many
took a part in the celebration of their visible signs. Nevertheless, with one consent both the
words and the visible rites of that law enjoin the worship of one God,—not one of a crowd
of gods, but Him who made heaven and earth, and every soul and every spirit which is
other than Himself. He created; all else was created; and, both for being and well-being, all
things need Him who created them.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Whether Those Angels Who Demand that We Pay Them Divine
Honor, or Those Who Teach Us to Render Holy Service, Not to Themselves,
But to God, are to Be Trusted About the Way to Life Eternal.</head>
<p>What angels, then, are we to believe in this matter of blessed and eternal life?—those
who wish to be worshipped with religious rites and observances, and require that men sacrifice
to them; or those who say that all this worship is due to one God, the Creator, and
teach us to render it with true piety to Him, by the vision of whom they are themselves
already blessed, and in whom they promise that we shall be so? For that vision of God is
the beauty of a vision so great, and is so infinitely desirable, that Plotinus does not hesitate
to say that he who enjoys all other blessings in abundance, and has not this, is supremely
miserable.410 Since, therefore, miracles are wrought by some angels to induce us to worship
this God, by others, to induce us to worship themselves; and since the former forbid us to
worship these, while the latter dare not forbid us to worship God, which are we to listen to?
Let the Platonists reply, or any philosophers, or the theurgists, or rather, periurgists,411—for
this name is good enough for those who practise such arts. In short, let all men answer,—if,
at least, there survives in them any spark of that natural perception which, as rational beings,
they possess when created,—let them, I say, tell us whether we should sacrifice to the gods
or angels who order us to sacrifice to them, or to that One to whom we are ordered to sacrifice
by those who forbid us to worship either themselves or these others. If neither the one party
nor the other had wrought miracles, but had merely uttered commands, the one to sacrifice
to themselves, the other forbidding that, and ordering us to sacrifice to God, a godly mind
would have been at no loss to discern which command proceeded from proud arrogance,
and which from true religion. I will say more. If miracles had been wrought only by those
who demand sacrifice for themselves, while those who forbade this, and enjoined sacrificing
to the one God only, thought fit entirely to forego the use of visible miracles, the authority
of the latter was to be preferred by all who would use, not their eyes only, but their reason.
But since God, for the sake of commending to us the oracles of His truth, has, by means of
these immortal messengers, who proclaim His majesty and not their own pride, wrought
miracles of surpassing grandeur, certainty, and distinctness, in order that the weak among
the godly might not be drawn away to false religion by those who require us to sacrifice to
them and endeavor to convince us by stupendous appeals to our senses, who is so utterly
unreasonable as not to choose and follow the truth, when he finds that it is heralded by even
more striking evidences than falsehood?</p>
<p>As for those miracles which history ascribes to the gods of the heathen,—I do not refer
to those prodigies which at intervals happen from some unknown physical causes, and
<note type="footnote">410 Ennead. 1. vi. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">411 Meaning, officious meddlers.</note>

<pb n="446"/>
which are arranged and appointed by Divine Providence, such as monstrous births, and
unusual meteorological phenomena, whether startling only, or also injurious, and which
are said to be brought about and removed by communication with demons, and by their
most deceitful craft,—but I refer to these prodigies which manifestly enough are wrought
by their power and force, as, that the household gods which Æneas carried from Troy in his
flight moved from place to place; that Tarquin cut a whetstone with a razor; that the Epidaurian
serpent attached himself as a companion to Æsculapius on his voyage to Rome;
that the ship in which the image of the Phrygian mother stood, and which could not be
moved by a host of men and oxen, was moved by one weak woman, who attached her girdle
to the vessel and drew it, as proof of her chastity; that a vestal, whose virginity was questioned,
removed the suspicion by carrying from the Tiber a sieve full of water without any of it
dropping: these, then, and the like, are by no means to be compared for greatness and virtue
to those which, we read, were wrought among God’s people. How much less can we compare
those marvels, which even the laws of heathen nations prohibit and punish,—I mean the
magical and theurgic marvels, of which the great part are merely illusions practised upon
the senses, as the drawing down of the moon, “that,” as Lucan says, “it may shed a stronger
influence on the plants?”412 And if some of these do seem to equal those which are wrought
by the godly, the end for which they are wrought distinguishes the two, and shows that ours
are incomparably the more excellent. For those miracles commend the worship of a plurality
of gods, who deserve worship the less the more they demand it; but these of ours commend
the worship of the one God, who, both by the testimony of His own Scriptures, and by the
eventual abolition of sacrifices, proves that He needs no such offerings. If, therefore, any
angels demand sacrifice for themselves, we must prefer those who demand it, not for
themselves, but for God, the Creator of all, whom they serve. For thus they prove how sincerely
they love us, since they wish by sacrifice to subject us, not to themselves, but to Him
by the contemplation of whom they themselves are blessed, and to bring us to Him from
whom they themselves have never strayed. If, on the other hand, any angels wish us to
sacrifice, not to one, but to many, not, indeed, to themselves, but to the gods whose angels
they are, we must in this case also prefer those who are the angels of the one God of gods,
and who so bid us to worship Him as to preclude our worshipping any other. But, further,
if it be the case, as their pride and deceitfulness rather indicate, that they are neither good
angels nor the angels of good gods, but wicked demons, who wish sacrifice to be paid, not
to the one only and supreme God, but to themselves, what better protection against them
can we choose than that of the one God whom the good angels serve, the angels who bid us
sacrifice, not to themselves, but to Him whose sacrifice we ourselves ought to be?</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Concerning the Ark of the Covenant, and the Miraculous Signs
Whereby God Authenticated the Law and the Promise.</head>
<p>On this account it was that the law of God, given by the disposition of angels, and which
commanded that the one God of gods alone receive sacred worship, to the exclusion of all
others, was deposited in the ark, called the ark of the testimony. By this name it is sufficiently
indicated, not that God, who was worshipped by all those rites, was shut up and enclosed
in that place, though His responses emanated from it along with signs appreciable by the
senses, but that His will was declared from that throne. The law itself, too, was engraven
on tables of stone, and, as I have said, deposited in the ark, which the priests carried with
due reverence during the sojourn in the wilderness, along with the tabernacle, which was
in like manner called the tabernacle of the testimony; and there was then an accompanying
sign, which appeared as a cloud by day and as a fire by night; when the cloud moved, the
camp was shifted, and where it stood the camp was pitched. Besides these signs, and the
voices which proceeded from the place where the ark was, there were other miraculous
testimonies to the law. For when the ark was carried across Jordan, on the entrance to the
land of promise, the upper part of the river stopped in its course, and the lower part flowed
on, so as to present both to the ark and the people dry ground to pass over. Then, when it
was carried seven times round the first hostile and polytheistic city they came to, its walls
suddenly fell down, though assaulted by no hand, struck by no battering-ram. Afterwards,
too, when they were now resident in the land of promise, and the ark had, in punishment
of their sin, been taken by their enemies, its captors triumphantly placed it in the temple of
their favorite god, and left it shut up there, but, on opening the temple next day, they found
the image they used to pray to fallen to the ground and shamefully shattered. Then, being
them selves alarmed by portents, and still more shamefully punished, they restored the ark
of the testimony to the people from whom they had taken it. And what was the manner of
its restoration? They placed it on a wagon, and yoked to it cows from which they had taken
the calves, and let them choose their own course, expecting that in this way the divine will
would be indicated; and the cows without any man driving or directing them, steadily pursued
the way to the Hebrews, without regarding the lowing of their calves, and thus restored the
ark to its worshippers. To God these and such like wonders are small, but they are mighty
to terrify and give wholesome instruction to men. For if philosophers, and especially the
Platonists, are with justice esteemed wiser than other men, as I have just been mentioning,
because they taught that even these earthly and insignificant things are ruled by Divine
Providence, inferring this from the numberless beauties which are observable not only in
the bodies of animals, but even in plants and grasses, how much more plainly do these things
attest the presence of divinity which happen at the time predicted, and in which that religion
is commended which forbids the offering of sacrifice to any celestial, terrestrial, or infernal
being, and commands it to be offered to God only, who alone blesses us by His love for us,

<pb n="448"/>
and by our love to Him, and who, by arranging the appointed times of those sacrifices, and
by predicting that they were to pass into a better sacrifice by a better Priest, testified that
He has no appetite for these sacrifices, but through them indicated others of more substantial
blessing,—and all this not that He Himself may be glorified by these honors, but that we
may be stirred up to worship and cleave to Him, being inflamed by His love, which is our

<head>Chapter 18.—Against Those Who Deny that the Books of the Church are to Be Believed
About the Miracles Whereby the People of God Were Educated.</head>
<p>Will some one say that these miracles are false, that they never happened, and that the
records of them are lies? Whoever says so, and asserts that in such matters no records
whatever can be credited, may also say that there are no gods who care for human affairs.
For they have induced men to worship them only by means of miraculous works, which the
heathen histories testify, and by which the gods have made a display of their own power
rather than done any real service. This is the reason why we have not undertaken in this
work, of which we are now writing the tenth book, to refute those who either deny that there
is any divine power, or contend that it does not interfere with human affairs, but those who
prefer their own god to our God, the Founder of the holy and most glorious city, not
knowing that He is also the invisible and unchangeable Founder of this visible and changing
world, and the truest bestower of the blessed life which resides not in things created, but in
Himself. For thus speaks His most trustworthy prophet: “It is good for me to be united to
God.”413 Among philosophers it is a question, what is that end and good to the attainment
of which all our duties are to have a relation? The Psalmist did not say, It is good for me to
have great wealth, or to wear imperial insignia, purple, sceptre, and diadem; or, as some
even of the philosophers have not blushed to say, It is good for me to enjoy sensual pleasure;
or, as the better men among them seemed to say, My good is my spiritual strength; but, “It
is good for me to be united to God.” This he had learned from Him whom the holy angels,
with the accompanying witness of miracles, presented as the sole object of worship. And
hence he himself became the sacrifice of God, whose spiritual love inflamed him, and into
whose ineffable and incorporeal embrace he yearned to cast himself. Moreover, if the worshippers
of many gods (whatever kind of gods they fancy their own to be) believe that the
miracles recorded in their civil histories, or in the books of magic, or of the more respectable
theurgy, were wrought by these gods, what reason have they for refusing to believe the
miracles recorded in those writings, to which we owe a credence as much greater as He is
greater to whom alone these writings teach us to sacrifice?</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—On the Reasonableness of Offering, as the True Religion Teaches, a
Visible Sacrifice to the One True and Invisible God.</head>
<p>As to those who think that these visible sacrifices are suitably offered to other gods, but
that invisible sacrifices, the graces of purity of mind and holiness of will, should be offered,
as greater and better, to the invisible God, Himself greater and better than all others, they
must be oblivious that these visible sacrifices are signs of the invisible, as the words we utter
are the signs of things. And therefore, as in prayer or praise we direct intelligible words to
Him to whom in our heart we offer the very feelings we are expressing, so we are to understand
that in sacrifice we offer visible sacrifice only to Him to whom in our heart we ought
to present ourselves an invisible sacrifice. It is then that the angels, and all those superior
powers who are mighty by their goodness and piety, regard us with pleasure, and rejoice
with us and assist us to the utmost of their power. But if we offer such worship to them,
they decline it; and when on any mission to men they become visible to the senses, they
positively forbid it. Examples of this occur in holy writ. Some fancied they should, by adoration
or sacrifice, pay the same honor to angels as is due to God, and were prevented from
doing so by the angels themselves, and ordered to render it to Him to whom alone they
know it to be due. And the holy angels have in this been imitated by holy men of God. For
Paul and Barnabas, when they had wrought a miracle of healing in Lycaonia, were thought
to be gods, and the Lycaonians desired to sacrifice to them, and they humbly and piously
declined this honor, and announced to them the God in whom they should believe. And
those deceitful and proud spirits, who exact worship, do so simply because they know it to
be due to the true God. For that which they take pleasure in is not, as Porphyry says and
some fancy, the smell of the victims, but divine honors. They have, in fact, plenty odors on
all hands, and if they wished more, they could provide them for themselves. But the spirits
who arrogate to themselves divinity are delighted not with the smoke of carcasses but with
the suppliant spirit which they deceive and hold in subjection, and hinder from drawing
near to God, preventing him from offering himself in sacrifice to God by inducing him to
sacrifice to others.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Of the Supreme and True Sacrifice Which Was Effected by the Mediator

<p>And hence that true Mediator, in so far as, by assuming the form of a servant, He became
the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, though in the form of God He
received sacrifice together with the Father, with whom He is one God, yet in the form of a
servant He chose rather to be than to receive a sacrifice, that not even by this instance any
one might have occasion to suppose that sacrifice should be rendered to any creature. Thus
He is both the Priest who offers and the Sacrifice offered. And He designed that there should
be a daily sign of this in the sacrifice of the Church, which, being His body, learns to offer
herself through Him. Of this true Sacrifice the ancient sacrifices of the saints were the
various and numerous signs; and it was thus variously figured, just as one thing is signified
by a variety of words, that there may be less weariness when we speak of it much. To this
supreme and true sacrifice all false sacrifices have given place.</p>

<head>Chapter 21 .—Of the Power Delegated to Demons for the Trial and Glorification of
the Saints, Who Conquer Not by Propitiating the Spirits of the Air, But by
Abiding in God.</head>
<p>The power delegated to the demons at certain appointed and well-adjusted seasons,
that they may give expression to their hostility to the city of God by stirring up against it
the men who are under their influence, and may not only receive sacrifice from those who
willingly offer it, but may also extort it from the unwilling by violent persecution;—this
power is found to be not merely harmless, but even useful to the Church, completing as it
does the number of martyrs, whom the city of God esteems as all the more illustrious and
honored citizens, because they have striven even to blood against the sin of impiety. If the
ordinary language of the Church allowed it, we might more elegantly call these men our
heroes. For this name is said to be derived from Juno, who in Greek is called Hêrê, and
hence, according to the Greek myths, one of her sons was called Heros. And these fables
mystically signified that Juno was mistress of the air, which they suppose to be inhabited
by the demons and the heroes, understanding by heroes the souls of the well-deserving
dead. But for a quite opposite reason would we call our martyrs heroes,—supposing, as I
said, that the usage of ecclesiastical language would admit of it,—not because they lived
along with the demons in the air, but because they conquered these demons or powers of
the air, and among them Juno herself, be she what she may, not unsuitably represented, as
she commonly is by the poets, as hostile to virtue, and jealous of men of mark aspiring to
the heavens. Virgil, however, unhappily gives way, and yields to her; for, though he represents
her as saying, “I am conquered by Æneas,”414 Helenus gives Æneas himself this religious
advice:
<lg>
<l>“Pay vows to Juno: overbear</l>
<l>Her queenly soul with gift and prayer.”415</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>In conformity with this opinion, Porphyry— expressing, however, not so much his
own views as other people’s—says that a good god or genius cannot come to a man unless
the evil genius has been first of all propitiated, implying that the evil deities had greater
power than the good; for, until they have been appeased and give place, the good can give
no assistance; and if the evil deities oppose, the good can give no help; whereas the evil can
do injury without the good being able to prevent them. This is not the way of the true and
truly holy religion; not thus do our martyrs conquer Juno, that is to say, the powers of the
air, who envy the virtues of the pious. Our heroes, if we could so call them, overcome Hêrê,
not by suppliant gifts, but by divine virtues. As Scipio, who conquered Africa by his valor,

<head>Chapter 22.—Whence the Saints Derive Power Against Demons and True Purification
of Heart.</head>
<p>It is by true piety that men of God cast out the hostile power of the air which opposes
godliness; it is by exorcising it, not by propitiating it; and they overcome all the temptations
of the adversary by praying, not to him, but to their own God against him. For the devil
cannot conquer or subdue any but those who are in league with sin; and therefore he is
conquered in the name of Him who assumed humanity, and that without sin, that Himself
being both Priest and Sacrifice, He might bring about the remission of sins, that is to say,
might bring it about through the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, by
whom we are reconciled to God, the cleansing from sin being accomplished. For men are
separated from God only by sins, from which we are in this life cleansed not by our own
virtue, but by the divine compassion; through His indulgence, not through our own power.
For, whatever virtue we call our own is itself bestowed upon us by His goodness. And we
might attribute too much to ourselves while in the flesh, unless we lived in the receipt of
pardon until we laid it down. This is the reason why there has been vouchsafed to us, through
the Mediator, this grace, that we who are polluted by sinful flesh should be cleansed by the
likeness of sinful flesh. By this grace of God, wherein He has shown His great compassion
toward us, we are both governed by faith in this life, and, after this life, are led onwards to
the fullest perfection by the vision of immutable truth.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Of the Principles Which, According to the Platonists, Regulate the
Purification of the Soul.</head>
<p>Even Porphyry asserts that it was revealed by divine oracles that we are not purified by
any sacrifices416 to sun or moon, meaning it to be inferred that we are not purified by sacrificing
to any gods. For what mysteries can purify, if those of the sun and moon, which are
esteemed the chief of the celestial gods, do not purify? He says, too, in the same place, that
“principles” can purify, lest it should be supposed, from his saying that sacrificing to the
sun and moon cannot purify, that sacrificing to some other of the host of gods might do
so. And what he as a Platonist means by “principles,” we know.417 For he speaks of God
the Father and God the Son, whom he calls (writing in Greek) the intellect or mind of the
Father;418 but of the Holy Spirit he says either nothing, or nothing plainly, for I do not understand
what other he speaks of as holding the middle place between these two. For if, like
Plotinus in his discussion regarding the three principal substances,419 he wished us to understand
by this third the soul of nature, he would certainly not have given it the middle
place between these two, that is, between the Father and the Son. For Plotinus places the
soul of nature after the intellect of the Father, while Porphyry, making it the mean, does not
place it after, but between the others. No doubt he spoke according to his light, or as he
thought expedient; but we assert that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit not of the Father only, nor
of the Son only, but of both. For philosophers speak as they have a mind to, and in the most
difficult matters do not scruple to offend religious ears; but we are bound to speak according
to a certain rule, lest freedom of speech beget impiety of opinion about the matters themselves
of which we speak.</p>
<note type="footnote">416 Teletis.</note>
<note type="footnote">417 The Platonists of the Alexandrian and Athenian schools, from Plotinus to Proclus, are at one in recognizing
in God three principles or hypostases: 1st, the One or the Good, which is the Father; 2nd, the Intelligence or
Word, which is the Son; 3rd, the Soul, which is the universal principle of life. But as to the nature and order of
these hypostases, the Alexandrians are no longer at one with the school of Athens. On the very subtle differences
between the Trinity of Plotinus and that of Porphyry, consult M. Jules Simon, ii. 110, and M. Vacherot, ii.37.—Saisset.</note>

<head>Chapter 24.—Of the One Only True Principle Which Alone Purifies and Renews
Human Nature.</head>
<p>Accordingly, when we speak of God, we do not affirm two or three principles, no more
than we are at liberty to affirm two or three gods; although, speaking of each, of the Father,
or of the Son, or of the Holy Ghost, we confess that each is God: and yet we do not say, as
the Sabellian heretics say, that the Father is the same as the Son, and the Holy Spirit the
same as the Father and the Son; but we say that the Father is the Father of the Son, and the
Son the Son of the Father, and that the Holy Spirit of the Father and the Son is neither the
Father nor the Son. It was therefore truly said that man is cleansed only by a Principle, although
the Platonists erred in speaking in the plural of principles. But Porphyry, being under
the dominion of these envious powers, whose influence he was at once ashamed of and
afraid to throw off, refused to recognize that Christ is the Principle by whose incarnation
we are purified. Indeed he despised Him, because of the flesh itself which He assumed, that
He might offer a sacrifice for our purification,—a great mystery, unintelligible to Porphyry’s
pride, which that true and benignant Redeemer brought low by His humility, manifesting
Himself to mortals by the mortality which He assumed, and which the malignant and deceitful
mediators are proud of wanting, promising, as the boon of immortals, a deceptive
assistance to wretched men. Thus the good and true Mediator showed that it is sin which
is evil, and not the substance or nature of flesh; for this, together with the human soul, could
without sin be both assumed and retained, and laid down in death, and changed to something
better by resurrection. He showed also that death itself, although the punishment of sin,
was submitted to by Him for our sakes without sin, and must not be evaded by sin on our
part, but rather, if opportunity serves, be borne for righteousness’ sake. For he was able to
expiate sins by dying, because He both died, and not for sin of His own. But He has not
been recognized by Porphyry as the Principle, otherwise he would have recognized Him as
the Purifier. The Principle is neither the flesh nor the human soul in Christ but the Word
by which all things were made. The flesh, therefore, does not by its own virtue purify, but
by virtue of the Word by which it was assumed, when “the Word became flesh and dwelt
among us.”420 For speaking mystically of eating His flesh, when those who did not understand
Him were offended and went away, saying, “This is an hard saying, who can hear it?”
He answered to the rest who remained, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
nothing.”421 The Principle, therefore, having assumed a human soul and flesh, cleanses the
soul and flesh of believers. Therefore, when the Jews asked Him who He was, He answered
that He was the Principle.422 And this we carnal and feeble men, liable to sin, and involved

in the darkness of ignorance, could not possibly understand, unless we were cleansed and
healed by Him, both by means of what we were, and of what we were not. For we were men,
but we were not righteous; whereas in His incarnation there was a human nature, but it was
righteous, and not sinful. This is the mediation whereby a hand is stretched to the lapsed
and fallen; this is the seed “ordained by angels,” by whose ministry the law also was given
enjoining the worship of one God, and promising that this Mediator should come.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—That All the Saints, Both Under the Law and Before It, Were Justified
by Faith in the Mystery of Christ’s Incarnation.</head>
<p>It was by faith in this mystery, and godliness of life, that purification was attainable even
by the saints of old, whether before the law was given to the Hebrews (for God and the angels
were even then present as instructors), or in the periods under the law, although the promises
of spiritual things, being presented in figure, seemed to be carnal, and hence the name of
Old Testament. For it was then the prophets lived, by whom, as by angels, the same promise
was announced; and among them was he whose grand and divine sentiment regarding the
end and supreme good of man I have just now quoted, “It is good for me to cleave to
God.”423 In this psalm the distinction between the Old and New Testaments is distinctly
announced. For the Psalmist says, that when he saw that the carnal and earthly promises
were abundantly enjoyed by the ungodly, his feet were almost gone, his steps had well-nigh
slipped; and that it seemed to him as if he had served God in vain, when he saw that those
who despised God increased in that prosperity which he looked for at God’s hand. He says,
too, that, in investigating this matter with the desire of understanding why it was so, he had
labored in vain, until he went into the sanctuary of God, and understood the end of those
whom he had erroneously considered happy. Then he understood that they were cast down
by that very thing, as he says, which they had made their boast, and that they had been
consumed and perished for their inequities; and that that whole fabric of temporal
prosperity had become as a dream when one awaketh, and suddenly finds himself destitute
of all the joys he had imaged in sleep. And, as in this earth or earthy city they seemed to
themselves to be great, he says, “O Lord, in Thy city Thou wilt reduce their image to nothing.”
He also shows how beneficial it had been for him to seek even earthly blessings only
from the one true God, in whose power are all things, for he says, “As a beast was I before
Thee, and I am always with Thee.” “As a beast,” he says, meaning that he was stupid. For
I ought to have sought from Thee such things as the ungodly could not enjoy as well as I,
and not those things which I saw them enjoying in abundance, and hence concluded I was
serving Thee in vain, because they who declined to serve Thee had what I had not. Nevertheless,
“I am always with Thee,” because even in my desire for such things I did not pray
to other gods. And consequently he goes on, “Thou hast holden me by my right hand, and
by Thy counsel Thou hast guided me, and with glory hast taken me up;” as if all earthly advantages
were left-hand blessings, though, when he saw them enjoyed by the wicked, his
feet had almost gone. “For what,” he says, “have I in heaven, and what have I desired from
Thee upon earth?” He blames himself, and is justly displeased with himself; because, though
he had in heaven so vast a possession (as he afterwards understood), he yet sought from his
God on earth a transitory and fleeting happiness;—a happiness of mire, we may say. “My
<note type="footnote">423 Ps. lxxiii. 28.</note>

<pb n="459"/>
heart and my flesh,” he says, “fail, O God of my heart.” Happy failure, from things below
to things above! And hence in another psalm He says, “My soul longeth, yea, even faileth,
for the courts of the Lord.”424 Yet, though he had said of both his heart and his flesh that
they were failing, he did not say, O God of my heart and my flesh, but, O God of my heart;
for by the heart the flesh is made clean. Therefore, says the Lord, “Cleanse that which is
within, and the outside shall be clean also.”425 He then says that God Himself,—not anything
received from Him, but Himself,—is his portion. “The God of my heart, and my portion
for ever.” Among the various objects of human choice, God alone satisfied him. “For, lo,”
he says, “they that are far from Thee shall perish: Thou destroyest all them that go awhoring
from Thee,”—that is, who prostitute themselves to many gods. And then follows
the verse for which all the rest of the psalm seems to prepare: “It is good for me to cleave
to God,”—not to go far off; not to go a-whoring with a multitude of gods. And then shall
this union with God be perfected, when all that is to be redeemed in us has been redeemed.
But for the present we must, as he goes on to say, “place our hope in God.” “For that which
is seen,” says the apostle, “is not hope. For what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But
if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.”426 Being, then, for the
present established in this hope, let us do what the Psalmist further indicates, and become
in our measure angels or messengers of God, declaring His will, and praising His glory and
His grace. For when he had said, “To place my hope in God,” he goes on, “that I may declare
all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.” This is the most glorious city of God;
this is the city which knows and worships one God: she is celebrated by the holy angels,
who invite us to their society, and desire us to become fellow-citizens with them in this city;
for they do not wish us to worship them as our gods, but to join them in worshipping their
God and ours; nor to sacrifice to them, but, together with them, to become a sacrifice to
God. Accordingly, whoever will lay aside malignant obstinacy, and consider these things,
shall be assured that all these blessed and immortal spirits, who do not envy us (for if they
envied they were not blessed), but rather love us, and desire us to be as blessed as themselves,
look on us with greater pleasure, and give us greater assistance, when we join them in worshipping
one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, than if we were to offer to themselves sacrifice
and worship.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—Of Porphyry’s Weakness in Wavering Between the Confession of the
True God and the Worship of Demons.</head>
<p>I know not how it is so, but it seems to me that Porphyry blushed for his friends the
theurgists; for he knew all that I have adduced, but did not frankly condemn polytheistic
worship. He said, in fact, that there are some angels who visit earth, and reveal divine truth
to theurgists, and others who publish on earth the things that belong to the Father, His
height and depth. Can we believe, then, that the angels whose office it is to declare the will
of the Father, wish us to be subject to any but Him whose will they declare? And hence,
even this Platonist himself judiciously observes that we should rather imitate than invoke
them. We ought not, then, to fear that we may offend these immortal and happy subjects
of the one God by not sacrificing to them; for this they know to be due only to the one true
God, in allegiance to whom they themselves find their blessedness, and therefore they will
not have it given to them, either in figure or in the reality, which the mysteries of sacrifice
symbolized. Such arrogance belongs to proud and wretched demons, whose disposition is
diametrically opposite to the piety of those who are subject to God, and whose blessedness
consists in attachment to Him. And, that we also may attain to this bliss, they aid us, as is
fit, with sincere kindliness, and usurp over us no dominion, but declare to us Him under
whose rule we are then fellow-subjects. Why, then, O philosopher, do you still fear to speak
freely against the powers which are inimical both to true virtue and to the gifts of the true
God? Already you have discriminated between the angels who proclaim God’s will, and
those who visit theurgists, drawn down by I know not what art. Why do you still ascribe
to these latter the honor of declaring divine truth? If they do not declare the will of the
Father, what divine revelations can they make? Are not these the evil spirits who were bound
over by the incantations of an envious man,427 that they should not grant purity of soul to
another, and could not, as you say, be set free from these bonds by a good man anxious for
purity, and recover power over their own actions? Do you still doubt whether these are
wicked demons; or do you, perhaps, feign ignorance, that you may not give offence to the
theurgists, who have allured you by their secret rites, and have taught you, as a mighty boon,
these insane and pernicious devilries? Do you dare to elevate above the air, and even to
heaven, these envious powers, or pests, let me rather call them, less worthy of the name of
sovereign than of slave, as you yourself own; and are you not ashamed to place them even
among your sidereal gods, and so put a slight upon the stars themselves?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Of the Impiety of Porphyry, Which is Worse Than Even the Mistake
of Apuleius.</head>
<p>How much more tolerable and accordant with human feeling is the error of your Platonist
co-sectary Apuleius! for he attributed the diseases and storms of human passions only
to the demons who occupy a grade beneath the moon, and makes even this avowal as by
constraint regarding gods whom he honors; but the superior and celestial gods, who inhabit
the ethereal regions, whether visible, as the sun, moon, and other luminaries, whose brilliancy
makes them conspicuous, or invisible, but believed in by him, he does his utmost to remove
beyond the slightest stain of these perturbations. It is not, then, from Plato, but from your
Chaldæan teachers you have learned to elevate human vices to the ethereal and empyreal
regions of the world and to the celestial firmament, in order that your theurgists might be
able to obtain from your gods divine revelations; and yet you make yourself superior to
these divine revelations by your intellectual life, which dispenses with these theurgic purifications
as not needed by a philosopher. But, by way of rewarding your teachers, you recommend
these arts to other men, who, not being philosophers, may be persuaded to use
what you acknowledge to be useless to yourself, who are capable of higher things; so that
those who cannot avail themselves of the virtue of philosophy, which is too arduous for the
multitude, may, at your instigation, betake themselves to theurgists by whom they may be
purified, not, indeed, in the intellectual, but in the spiritual part of the soul. Now, as the
persons who are unfit for philosophy form incomparably the majority of mankind, more
may be compelled to consult these secret and illicit teachers of yours than frequent the Platonic
schools. For these most impure demons, pretending to be ethereal gods, whose herald
and messenger you have become, have promised that those who are purified by theurgy in
the spiritual part of their soul shall not indeed return to the Father, but shall dwell among
the ethereal gods above the aerial regions. But such fancies are not listened to by the multitudes
of men whom Christ came to set free from the tyranny of demons. For in Him they
have the most gracious cleansing, in which mind, spirit, and body alike participate. For, in
order that He might heal the whole man from the plague of sin, He took without sin the
whole human nature. Would that you had known Him, and would that you had committed
yourself for healing to Him rather than to your own frail and infirm human virtue, or to
pernicious and curious arts! He would not have deceived you; for Him your own oracles,
on your own showing, acknowledged holy and immortal. It is of Him, too, that the most
famous poet speaks, poetically indeed, since he applies it to the person of another, yet truly,
if you refer it to Christ , saying, “Under thine auspices, if any traces of our crimes remain,

<pb n="462"/>
they shall be obliterated, and earth freed from its perpetual fear.”428 By which he indicates
that, by reason of the infirmity which attaches to this life, the greatest progress in virtue and
righteousness leaves room for the existence, if not of crimes, yet of the traces of crimes,
which are obliterated only by that Saviour of whom this verse speaks. For that he did not
say this at the prompting of his own fancy, Virgil tells us in almost the last verse of that 4th
Eclogue, when he says, “The last age predicted by the Cumæan sibyl has now arrived;”
whence it plainly appears that this had been dictated by the Cumæan sibyl. But those theurgists,
or rather demons, who assume the appearance and form of gods, pollute rather than
purify the human spirit by false appearances and the delusive mockery of unsubstantial
forms. How can those whose own spirit is unclean cleanse the spirit of man? Were they

neither be afraid nor grudge to bestow that hollow boon which they promise. But it is sufficient
for our purpose that you acknowledge that the intellectual soul, that is, our mind,
cannot be justified by theurgy; and that even the spiritual or inferior part of our soul cannot
by this act be made eternal and immortal, though you maintain that it can be purified by
it. Christ, however, promises life eternal; and therefore to Him the world flocks, greatly to
your indignation, greatly also to your astonishment and confusion. What avails your forced
avowal that theurgy leads men astray, and deceives vast numbers by its ignorant and foolish
teaching, and that it is the most manifest mistake to have recourse by prayer and sacrifice
to angels and principalities, when at the same time, to save yourself from the charge of
spending labor in vain on such arts, you direct men to the theurgists, that by their means
men, who do not live by the rule of the intellectual soul, may have their spiritual soul purified?</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—How It is that Porphyry Has Been So Blind as Not to Recognize the
True Wisdom—Christ.</head>
<p>You drive men, therefore, into the most palpable error. And yet you are not ashamed
of doing so much harm, though you call yourself a lover of virtue and wisdom. Had you
been true and faithful in this profession, you would have recognized Christ, the virtue of
God and the wisdom of God, and would not, in the pride of vain science, have revolted from
His wholesome humility. Nevertheless you acknowledge that the spiritual part of the soul
can be purified by the virtue of chastity without the aid of those theurgic arts and mysteries
which you wasted your time in learning. You even say, sometimes, that these mysteries do
not raise the soul after death, so that, after the termination of this life, they seem to be of no
service even to the part you call spiritual; and yet you recur on every opportunity to these
arts, for no other purpose, so far as I see, than to appear an accomplished theurgist, and
gratify those who are curious in illicit arts, or else to inspire others with the same curiosity.
But we give you all praise for saying that this art is to be feared, both on account of the legal
enactments against it, and by reason of the danger involved in the very practice of it. And
would that in this, at least, you were listened to by its wretched votaries, that they might be
withdrawn from entire absorption in it, or might even be preserved from tampering with
it at all! You say, indeed, that ignorance, and the numberless vices resulting from it, cannot
be removed by any mysteries, but only by the πατρικὸς νοῦς, that is, the Father’s mind or
intellect conscious of the Father’s will. But that Christ is this mind you do not believe; for
Him you despise on account of the body He took of a woman and the shame of the cross;
for your lofty wisdom spurns such low and contemptible things, and soars to more exalted
regions. But He fulfills what the holy prophets truly predicted regarding Him: “I will destroy
the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nought the prudence of the prudent.”429 For He does
not destroy and bring to nought His own gift in them, but what they arrogate to themselves,
and do not hold of Him. And hence the apostle, having quoted this testimony from the
prophet, adds, “Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world?
Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God,
the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save
them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom; but we
preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the
wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of
<note type="footnote">429 Isa. xxix. 14.</note>

<pb n="464"/>
God is stronger than men.”430 This is despised as a weak and foolish thing by those who
are wise and strong in themselves; yet this is the grace which heals the weak, who do not
proudly boast a blessedness of their own, but rather humbly acknowledge their real misery.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—Of the Incarnation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Which the Platonists in
Their Impiety Blush to Acknowledge.</head>
<p>You proclaim the Father and His Son, whom you call the Father’s intellect or mind, and
between these a third, by whom we suppose you mean the Holy Spirit, and in your own
fashion you call these three Gods. In this, though your expressions are inaccurate, you do
in some sort, and as through a veil, see what we should strive towards; but the incarnation
of the unchangeable Son of God, whereby we are saved, and are enabled to reach the things
we believe, or in part understand, this is what you refuse to recognize. You see in a fashion,
although at a distance, although with filmy eye, the country in which we should abide; but
the way to it you know not. Yet you believe in grace, for you say it is granted to few to reach
God by virtue of intelligence. For you do not say, “Few have thought fit or have wished,”
but, “It has been granted to few,”—distinctly acknowledging God’s grace, not man’s sufficiency.
You also use this word more expressly, when, in accordance with the opinion of
Plato, you make no doubt that in this life a man cannot by any means attain to perfect wisdom,
but that whatever is lacking is in the future life made up to those who live intellectually,
by God’s providence and grace. Oh, had you but recognized the grace of God in Jesus Christ
our Lord, and that very incarnation of His, wherein He assumed a human soul and body,
you might have seemed the brightest example of grace!431 But what am I doing? I know it
is useless to speak to a dead man,—useless, at least, so far as regards you, but perhaps not
in vain for those who esteem you highly, and love you on account of their love of wisdom
or curiosity about those arts which you ought not to have learned; and these persons I address
in your name. The grace of God could not have been more graciously commended to us
than thus, that the only Son of God, remaining unchangeable in Himself, should assume
humanity, and should give us the hope of His love, by means of the mediation of a human
nature, through which we, from the condition of men, might come to Him who was so far
off,—the immortal from the mortal; the unchangeable from the changeable; the just from
the unjust; the blessed from the wretched. And, as He had given us a natural instinct to
desire blessedness and immortality, He Himself continuing to be blessed; but assuming
mortality, by enduring what we fear, taught us to despise it, that what we long for He might
bestow upon us.</p>
<p>But in order to your acquiescence in this truth, it is lowliness that is requisite, and to
this it is extremely difficult to bend you. For what is there incredible, especially to men like
you, accustomed to speculation, which might have predisposed you to believe in this,—what
is there incredible, I say, in the assertion that God assumed a human soul and body? You
yourselves ascribe such excellence to the intellectual soul, which is, after all, the human soul,
that you maintain that it can become consubstantial with that intelligence of the Father
<note type="footnote">431 According to another reading, “You might have seen it to be,” etc.</note>

<pb n="466"/>
whom you believe in as the Son of God. What incredible thing is it, then, if some one soul
be assumed by Him in an ineffable and unique manner for the salvation of many? Moreover,
our nature itself testifies that a man is incomplete unless a body be united with the soul.
This certainly would be more incredible, were it not of all things the most common; for we
should more easily believe in a union between spirit and spirit, or, to use your own terminology,
between the incorporeal and the incorporeal, even though the one were human, the
other divine, the one changeable and the other unchangeable, than in a union between the
corporeal and the incorporeal. But perhaps it is the unprecedented birth of a body from a
virgin that staggers you? But, so far from this being a difficulty, it ought rather to assist you
to receive our religion, that a miraculous person was born miraculously. Or, do you find a
difficulty in the fact that, after His body had been given up to death, and had been changed
into a higher kind of body by resurrection, and was now no longer mortal but incorruptible,
He carried it up into heavenly places? Perhaps you refuse to believe this, because you remember
that Porphyry, in these very books from which I have cited so much, and which
treat of the return of the soul, so frequently teaches that a body of every kind is to be escaped
from, in order that the soul may dwell in blessedness with God. But here, in place of following
Porphyry, you ought rather to have corrected him, especially since you agree with him in
believing such incredible things about the soul of this visible world and huge material frame.
For, as scholars of Plato, you hold that the world is an animal, and a very happy animal,
which you wish to be also everlasting. How, then, is it never to be loosed from a body, and
yet never lose its happiness, if, in order to the happiness of the soul, the body must be left
behind? The sun, too, and the other stars, you not only acknowledge to be bodies, in which
you have the cordial assent of all seeing men, but also, in obedience to what you reckon a
profounder insight, you declare that they are very blessed animals, and eternal, together
with their bodies. Why is it, then, that when the Christian faith is pressed upon you, you
forget, or pretend to ignore, what you habitually discuss or teach? Why is it that you refuse
to be Christians, on the ground that you hold opinions which, in fact, you yourselves demolish?
Is it not because Christ came in lowliness, and ye are proud? The precise nature of the
resurrection bodies of the saints may sometimes occasion discussion among those who are
best read in the Christian Scriptures; yet there is not among us the smallest doubt that they
shall be everlasting, and of a nature exemplified in the instance of Christ’s risen body. But
whatever be their nature, since we maintain that they shall be absolutely incorruptible and
immortal, and shall offer no hindrance to the soul’s contemplation, by which it is fixed in
God, and as you say that among the celestials the bodies of the eternally blessed are eternal,
why do you maintain that, in order to blessedness, every body must be escaped from? Why
do you thus seek such a plausible reason for escaping from the Christian faith, if not because,
as I again say, Christ is humble and ye proud? Are ye ashamed to be corrected? This is the
vice of the proud. It is, forsooth, a degradation for learned men to pass from the school of

Plato to the discipleship of Christ, who by His Spirit taught a fisherman to think and to say,
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The
same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was
not anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And
the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”432 The old saint
Simplicianus, afterwards bishop of Milan, used to tell me that a certain Platonist was in the
habit of saying that this opening passage of the holy gospel, entitled, According to John,
should be written in letters of gold, and hung up in all churches in the most conspicuous
place. But the proud scorn to take God for their Master, because “the Word was made flesh
and dwelt among us.”433 So that, with these miserable creatures, it is not enough that they
are sick, but they boast of their sickness, and are ashamed of the medicine which could heal
them. And, doing so, they secure not elevation, but a more disastrous fall.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—Porphyry’s Emendations and Modifications of Platonism.</head>
<p>If it is considered unseemly to emend anything which Plato has touched, why did Porphyry
himself make emendations, and these not a few? for it is very certain that Plato wrote
that the souls of men return after death to the bodies of beasts.434 Plotinus also, Porphyry’s
teacher, held this opinion;435 yet Porphyry justly rejected it. He was of opinion that human
souls return indeed into human bodies, but not into the bodies they had left, but other new
bodies. He shrank from the other opinion, lest a woman who had returned into a mule
might possibly carry her own son on her back. He did not shrink, however, from a theory
which admitted the possibility of a mother coming back into a girl and marrying her own
son. How much more honorable a creed is that which was taught by the holy and truthful
angels, uttered by the prophets who were moved by God’s Spirit, preached by Him who was
foretold as the coming Saviour by His forerunning heralds, and by the apostles whom He
sent forth, and who filled the whole world with the gospel,—how much more honorable, I
say, is the belief that souls return once for all to their own bodies, than that they return again
and again to divers bodies? Nevertheless Porphyry, as I have said, did considerably improve
upon this opinion, in so far, at least, as he maintained that human souls could transmigrate
only into human bodies, and made no scruple about demolishing the bestial prisons into
which Plato had wished to cast them. He says, too, that God put the soul into the world
that it might recognize the evils of matter, and return to the Father, and be for ever emancipated
from the polluting contact of matter. And although here is some inappropriate
thinking (for the soul is rather given to the body that it may do good; for it would not learn
evil unless it did it), yet he corrects the opinion of other Platonists, and that on a point of
no small importance, inasmuch as he avows that the soul, which is purged from all evil and
received to the Father’s presence, shall never again suffer the ills of this life. By this opinion
he quite subverted the favorite Platonic dogma, that as dead men are made out of living
ones, so living men are made out of dead ones; and he exploded the idea which Virgil seems
to have adopted from Plato, that the purified souls which have been sent into the Elysian
fields (the poetic name for the joys of the blessed) are summoned to the river Lethe, that is,
to the oblivion of the past,
<lg>
<l>“That earthward they may pass once more,</l>
<l>Remembering not the things before,</l>
<l>And with a blind propension yearn</l>
<l>To fleshly bodies to return.”436</l>

<pb n="469"/>
<p>This found no favor with Porphyry, and very justly; for it is indeed foolish to believe
that souls should desire to return from that life, which cannot be very blessed unless by the
assurance of its permanence, and to come back into this life, and to the pollution of corruptible
bodies, as if the result of perfect purification were only to make defilement desirable.
For if perfect purification effects the oblivion of all evils, and the oblivion of evils creates a
desire for a body in which the soul may again be entangled with evils, then the supreme felicity
will be the cause of infelicity, and the perfection of wisdom the cause of foolishness,
and the purest cleansing the cause of defilement. And, however long the blessedness of the
soul last, it cannot be founded on truth, if, in order to be blessed, it must be deceived. For
it cannot be blessed unless it be free from fear. But, to be free from fear, it must be under
the false impression that it shall be always blessed,—the false impression, for it is destined
to be also at some time miserable. How, then, shall the soul rejoice in truth, whose joy is
founded on falsehood? Porphyry saw this, and therefore said that the purified soul returns
to the Father, that it may never more be entangled in the polluting contact with evil. The
opinion, therefore, of some Platonists, that there is a necessary revolution carrying souls
away and bringing them round again to the same things, is false. But, were it true, what
were the advantage of knowing it? Would the Platonists presume to allege their superiority
to us, because we were in this life ignorant of what they themselves were doomed to be ignorant
of when perfected in purity and wisdom in another and better life, and which they
must be ignorant of if they are to be blessed? If it were most absurd and foolish to say so,
then certainly we must prefer Porphyry’s opinion to the idea of a circulation of souls through
constantly alternating happiness and misery. And if this is just, here is a Platonist emending
Plato, here is a man who saw what Plato did not see, and who did not shrink from correcting
so illustrious a master, but preferred truth to Plato.</p>

<pb n="470"/>
<head>Chapter 31.—Against the Arguments on Which the Platonists Ground Their Assertion
that the Human Soul is Co-Eternal with God.</head>
<p>Why, then, do we not rather believe the divinity in those matters, which human talent
cannot fathom? Why do we not credit the assertion of divinity, that the soul is not coeternal
with God, but is created, and once was not? For the Platonists seemed to themselves
to allege an adequate reason for their rejection of this doctrine, when they affirmed that
nothing could be everlasting which had not always existed. Plato, however, in writing concerning
the world and the gods in it, whom the Supreme made, most expressly states that
they had a beginning and yet would have no end, but, by the sovereign will of the Creator,
would endure eternally. But, by way of interpreting this, the Platonists have discovered that
he meant a beginning, not of time, but of cause. “For as if a foot,” they say, “had been always
from eternity in dust, there would always have been a print underneath it; and yet no one
would doubt that this print was made by the pressure of the foot, nor that, though the one
was made by the other, neither was prior to the other; so,” they say, “the world and the gods
created in it have always been, their Creator always existing, and yet they were made.” If,
then, the soul has always existed, are we to say that its wretchedness has always existed?
For if there is something in it which was not from eternity, but began in time, why is it impossible
that the soul itself, though not previously existing, should begin to be in time? Its
blessedness, too, which, as he owns, is to be more stable, and indeed endless, after the soul’s
experience of evils,—this undoubtedly has a beginning in time, and yet is to be always,
though previously it had no existence. This whole argumentation, therefore, to establish
that nothing can be endless except that which has had no beginning, falls to the ground.
For here we find the blessedness of the soul, which has a beginning, and yet has no end.
And, therefore, let the incapacity of man give place to the authority of God; and let us take
our belief regarding the true religion from the ever-blessed spirits, who do not seek for
themselves that honor which they know to be due to their God and ours, and who do not
command us to sacrifice save only to Him, whose sacrifice, as I have often said already, and
must often say again, we and they ought together to be, offered through that Priest who
offered Himself to death a sacrifice for us, in that human nature which He assumed, and
according to which He desired to be our Priest.</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—Of the Universal Way of the Soul’s Deliverance, Which Porphyry Did
Not Find Because He Did Not Rightly Seek It, and Which the Grace of Christ
Has Alone Thrown Open.</head>
<p>This is the religion which possesses the universal way for delivering the soul; for except
by this way, none can be delivered. This is a kind of royal way, which alone leads to a
kingdom which does not totter like all temporal dignities, but stands firm on eternal
foundations. And when Porphyry says, towards the end of the first book De Regressu Animoe,
that no system of doctrine which furnishes the universal way for delivering the soul has as
yet been received, either from the truest philosophy, or from the ideas and practices of the
Indians, or from the reasoning437 of the Chaldæans, or from any source whatever, and that
no historical reading had made him acquainted with that way, he manifestly acknowledges
that there is such a way, but that as yet he was not acquainted with it. Nothing of all that
he had so laboriously learned concerning the deliverance of the soul, nothing of all that he
seemed to others, if not to himself, to know and believe, satisfied him. For he perceived
that there was still wanting a commanding authority which it might be right to follow in a
matter of such importance. And when he says that he had not learned from any truest
philosophy a system which possessed the universal way of the soul’s deliverance, he shows
plainly enough, as it seems to me, either that the philosophy of which he was a disciple was
not the truest, or that it did not comprehend such a way. And how can that be the truest
philosophy which does not possess this way? For what else is the universal way of the soul’s
deliverance than that by which all souls universally are delivered, and without which,
therefore, no soul is delivered? And when he says, in addition, “or from the ideas and
practices of the Indians, or from the reasoning of the Chaldæans, or from any source
whatever,” he declares in the most unequivocal language that this universal way of the soul’s
deliverance was not embraced in what he had learned either from the Indians or the
Chaldæans; and yet he could not forbear stating that it was from the Chaldæans he had derived
these divine oracles of which he makes such frequent mention. What, therefore, does
he mean by this universal way of the soul’s deliverance, which had not yet been made known
by any truest philosophy, or by the doctrinal systems of those nations which were considered
to have great insight in things divine, because they indulged more freely in a curious and
fanciful science and worship of angels? What is this universal way of which he acknowledges
his ignorance, if not a way which does not belong to one nation as its special property, but
is common to all, and divinely bestowed? Porphyry, a man of no mediocre abilities, does
not question that such a way exists; for he believes that Divine Providence could not have
left men destitute of this universal way of delivering the soul. For he does not say that this
way does not exist, but that this great boon and assistance has not yet been discovered, and
<note type="footnote">437 Inductio.</note>

<pb n="472"/>
has not come to his knowledge. And no wonder; for Porphyry lived in an age when this
universal way of the soul’s deliverance,—in other words, the Christian religion,—was exposed
to the persecutions of idolaters and demon-worshippers, and earthly rulers,438 that the
number of martyrs or witnesses for the truth might be completed and consecrated, and that
by them proof might be given that we must endure all bodily sufferings in the cause of the
holy faith, and for the commendation of the truth. Porphyry, being a witness of these persecutions,
concluded that this way was destined to a speedy extinction, and that it, therefore,
was not the universal way of the soul’s deliverance, and did not see that the very thing that
thus moved him, and deterred him from becoming a Christian, contributed to the confirmation
and more effectual commendation of our religion.</p>
<p>This, then, is the universal way of the soul’s deliverance, the way that is granted by the
divine compassion to the nations universally. And no nation to which the knowledge of it
has already come, or may hereafter come, ought to demand, Why so soon? or, Why so
late?—for the design of Him who sends it is impenetrable by human capacity. This was felt
by Porphyry when he confined himself to saying that this gift of God was not yet received,
and had not yet come to his knowledge. For though this was so, he did not on that account
pronounce that the way it self had no existence. This, I say, is the universal way for the
deliverance of believers, concerning which the faithful Abraham received the divine assurance,
“In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.”439 He, indeed, was by birth a Chaldæan; but, that
he might receive these great promises, and that there might be propagated from him a seed
“disposed by angels in the hand of a Mediator,”440 in whom this universal way, thrown open
to all nations for the deliverance of the soul, might be found, he was ordered to leave his
country, and kindred, and father’s house. Then was he himself, first of all, delivered from
the Chaldæan superstitions, and by his obedience worshipped the one true God, whose
promises he faithfully trusted. This is the universal way, of which it is said in holy prophecy,
“God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us; that Thy way
may be known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations.”441 And hence, when our
Saviour, so long after, had taken flesh of the seed of Abraham, He says of Himself, “I am
the way, the truth, and the life.”442 This is the universal way, of which so long before it had
been predicted, “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s
house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills;
and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us

go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us
of His ways, and we will walk in His paths: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”443 This way, therefore, is not the property of one, but
of all nations. The law and the word of the Lord did not remain in Zion and Jerusalem, but
issued thence to be universally diffused. And therefore the Mediator Himself, after His resurrection,
says to His alarmed disciples, “These are the words which I spake unto you while
I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses,
and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me. Then opened He their understandings
that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”
444 This is the universal way of the soul’s deliverance, which the holy angels and
the holy prophets formerly disclosed where they could among the few men who found the
grace of God, and especially in the Hebrew nation, whose commonwealth was, as it were,
consecrated to prefigure and fore-announce the city of God which was to be gathered from
all nations, by their tabernacle, and temple, and priesthood, and sacrifices. In some explicit
statements, and in many obscure foreshadowings, this way was declared; but latterly came
the Mediator Himself in the flesh, and His blessed apostles, revealing how the grace of the
New Testament more openly explained what had been obscurely hinted to preceding generations,
in conformity with the relation of the ages of the human race, and as it pleased
God in His wisdom to appoint, who also bore them witness with signs and miracles some
of which I have cited above. For not only were there visions of angels, and words heard
from those heavenly ministrants, but also men of God, armed with the word of simple piety,
cast out unclean spirits from the bodies and senses of men, and healed deformities and
sicknesses; the wild beasts of earth and sea, the birds of air, inanimate things, the elements,
the stars, obeyed their divine commands; the powers of hell gave way before them, the dead
were restored to life. I say nothing of the miracles peculiar and proper to the Saviour’s own
person, especially the nativity and the resurrection; in the one of which He wrought only
the mystery of a virgin maternity, while in the other He furnished an instance of the resurrection
which all shall at last experience. This way purifies the whole man, and prepares
the mortal in all his parts for immortality. For, to prevent us from seeking for one purgation
for the part which Porphyry calls intellectual, and another for the part he calls spiritual, and
another for the body itself, our most mighty and truthful Purifier and Saviour assumed the
whole human nature. Except by this way, which has been present among men both during
<note type="footnote">443 Isa. ii. 2, 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">444 Luke xxiv. 44–47.</note>

<pb n="474"/>
the period of the promises and of the proclamation of their fulfillment, no man has been
delivered, no man is delivered, no man shall be delivered.</p>
<p>As to Porphyry’s statement that the universal way of the soul’s deliverance had not yet
come to his knowledge by any acquaintance he had with history, I would ask, what more
remarkable history can be found than that which has taken possession of the whole world
by its authoritative voice? or what more trustworthy than that which narrates past events,
and predicts the future with equal clearness, and in the unfulfilled predictions of which we
are constrained to believe by those that are already fulfilled? For neither Porphyry nor any
Platonists can despise divination and prediction, even of things that pertain to this life and
earthly matters, though they justly despise ordinary soothsaying and the divination that is
connected with magical arts. They deny that these are the predictions of great men, or are
to be considered important, and they are right; for they are founded, either on the foresight
of subsidiary causes, as to a professional eye much of the course of a disease is foreseen by
certain pre-monitory symptoms, or the unclean demons predict what they have resolved
to do, that they may thus work upon the thoughts and desires of the wicked with an appearance
of authority, and incline human frailty to imitate their impure actions. It is not such
things that the saints who walk in the universal way care to predict as important, although,
for the purpose of commending the faith, they knew and often predicted even such things
as could not be detected by human observation, nor be readily verified by experience. But
there were other truly important and divine events which they predicted, in so far as it was
given them to know the will of God. For the incarnation of Christ, and all those important
marvels that were accomplished in Him, and done in His name; the repentance of men and
the conversion of their wills to God; the remission of sins, the grace of righteousness, the
faith of the pious, and the multitudes in all parts of the world who believe in the true divinity;
the overthrow of idolatry and demon worship, and the testing of the faithful by trials; the
purification of those who persevered, and their deliverance from all evil; the day of judgment,
the resurrection of the dead, the eternal damnation of the community of the ungodly, and
the eternal kingdom of the most glorious city of God, ever-blessed in the enjoyment of the
vision of God,—these things were predicted and promised in the Scriptures of this way; and
of these we see so many fulfilled, that we justly and piously trust that the rest will also come
to pass. As for those who do not believe, and consequently do not understand, that this is
the way which leads straight to the vision of God and to eternal fellowship with Him, according
to the true predictions and statements of the Holy Scriptures, they may storm at our
position, but they cannot storm it.</p>
<p>And therefore, in these ten books, though not meeting, I dare say, the expectation of
some, yet I have, as the true God and Lord has vouchsafed to aid me, satisfied the desire of
certain persons, by refuting the objections of the ungodly, who prefer their own gods to the
Founder of the holy city, about which we undertook to speak. Of these ten books, the first

blessings of this life, and the second five against those who think we should worship them
for the sake of the life which is to be after death. And now, in fulfillment of the promise I
made in the first book, I shall go on to say, as God shall aid me, what I think needs to be
said regarding the origin, history, and deserved ends of the two cities, which, as already remarked,

<head>Chapter 1.—Of This Part of the Work, Wherein We Begin to Explain the Origin
and End of the Two Cities.</head>
<p>The city of God we speak of is the same to which testimony is borne by that Scripture,
which excels all the writings of all nations by its divine authority, and has brought under its
influence all kinds of minds, and this not by a casual intellectual movement, but obviously
by an express providential arrangement. For there it is written, “Glorious things are spoken
of thee, O city of God.”446 And in another psalm we read, “Great is the Lord, and greatly
to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness, increasing the joy of
the whole earth.”447 And, a little after, in the same psalm, “As we have heard, so have we
seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God. God has established it for ever.”
And in another, “There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of our God,
the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. God is in the midst of her, she shall not
be moved.”448 From these and similar testimonies, all of which it were tedious to cite, we
have learned that there is a city of God, and its Founder has inspired us with a love which
makes us covet its citizenship. To this Founder of the holy city the citizens of the earthly
city prefer their own gods, not knowing that He is the God of gods, not of false, i.e., of impious
and proud gods, who, being deprived of His unchangeable and freely communicated light,
and so reduced to a kind of poverty-stricken power, eagerly grasp at their own private
privileges, and seek divine honors from their deluded subjects; but of the pious and holy
gods, who are better pleased to submit themselves to one, than to subject many to themselves,
and who would rather worship God than be worshipped as God. But to the enemies of this
city we have replied in the ten preceding books, according to our ability and the help afforded
by our Lord and King. Now, recognizing what is expected of me, and not unmindful of my
promise, and relying, too, on the same succor, I will endeavor to treat of the origin, and
progress, and deserved destinies of the two cities (the earthly and the heavenly, to wit),
which, as we said, are in this present world commingled, and as it were entangled together.
And, first, I will explain how the foundations of these two cities were originally laid, in the
difference that arose among the angels.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Of the Knowledge of God, to Which No Man Can Attain Save Through
the Mediator Between God and Men, the Man Christ Jesus.</head>
<p>It is a great and very rare thing for a man, after he has contemplated the whole creation,
corporeal and incorporeal, and has discerned its mutability, to pass beyond it, and, by the
continued soaring of his mind, to attain to the unchangeable substance of God, and, in that
height of contemplation, to learn from God Himself that none but He has made all that is
not of the divine essence. For God speaks with a man not by means of some audible creature
dinning in his ears, so that atmospheric vibrations connect Him that makes with him that
hears the sound, nor even by means of a spiritual being with the semblance of a body, such
as we see in dreams or similar states; for even in this case He speaks as if to the ears of the
body, because it is by means of the semblance of a body He speaks, and with the appearance
of a real interval of space,—for visions are exact representations of bodily objects. Not by
these, then, does God speak, but by the truth itself, if any one is prepared to hear with the
mind rather than with the body. For He speaks to that part of man which is better than all
else that is in him, and than which God Himself alone is better. For since man is most
properly understood (or, if that cannot be, then, at least, believed) to be made in God’s image,
no doubt it is that part of him by which he rises above those lower parts he has in common
with the beasts, which brings him nearer to the Supreme. But since the mind itself, though
naturally capable of reason and intelligence is disabled by besotting and inveterate vices not
merely from delighting and abiding in, but even from tolerating His unchangeable light,
until it has been gradually healed, and renewed, and made capable of such felicity, it had,
in the first place, to be impregnated with faith, and so purified. And that in this faith it
might advance the more confidently towards the truth, the truth itself, God, God’s Son, assuming
humanity without destroying His divinity,449 established and founded this faith,
that there might be a way for man to man’s God through a God-man. For this is the Mediator
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. For it is as man that He is the Mediator
and the Way. Since, if the way lieth between him who goes, and the place whither he goes,
there is hope of his reaching it; but if there be no way, or if he know not where it is, what
boots it to know whither he should go? Now the only way that is infallibly secured against
all mistakes, is when the very same person is at once God and man, God our end, man our
way.450</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Of the Authority of the Canonical Scriptures Composed by the Divine
Spirit.</head>
<p>This Mediator, having spoken what He judged sufficient first by the prophets, then by
His own lips, and afterwards by the apostles, has besides produced the Scripture which is
called canonical, which has paramount authority, and to which we yield assent in all matters
of which we ought not to be ignorant, and yet cannot know of ourselves. For if we attain
the knowledge of present objects by the testimony of our own senses,451 whether internal
or external, then, regarding objects remote from our own senses, we need others to bring
their testimony, since we cannot know them by our own, and we credit the persons to whom
the objects have been or are sensibly present. Accordingly, as in the case of visible objects
which we have not seen, we trust those who have, (and likewise with all sensible objects,)
so in the case of things which are perceived452 by the mind and spirit, i.e., which are remote
from our own interior sense, it behoves us to trust those who have seen them set in that incorporeal
light, or abidingly contemplate them.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—That the World is Neither Without Beginning, Nor Yet Created by a
New Decree of God, by Which He Afterwards Willed What He Had Not Before
Willed.</head>
<p>Of all visible things, the world is the greatest; of all invisible, the greatest is God. But,
that the world is, we see; that God is, we believe. That God made the world, we can believe
from no one more safely than from God Himself. But where have we heard Him? Nowhere
more distinctly than in the Holy Scriptures, where His prophet said, “In the beginning God
created the heavens and the earth.”453 Was the prophet present when God made the heavens
and the earth? No; but the wisdom of God, by whom all things were made, was there,454
and wisdom insinuates itself into holy souls, and makes them the friends of God and His
prophets, and noiselessly informs them of His works. They are taught also by the angels of
God, who always behold the face of the Father,455 and announce His will to whom it befits.
Of these prophets was he who said and wrote, “In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth.” And so fit a witness was he of God, that the same Spirit of God, who revealed
these things to him, enabled him also so long before to predict that our faith also would be
forthcoming.</p>
<p>But why did God choose then to create the heavens and earth which up to that time He
had not made?456 If they who put this question wish to make out that the world is eternal
and without beginning, and that consequently it has not been made by God, they are strangely
deceived, and rave in the incurable madness of impiety. For, though the voices of the
prophets were silent, the world itself, by its well-ordered changes and movements, and by
the fair appearance of all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has been
created, and also that it could not have been created save by God, whose greatness and
beauty are unutterable and invisible. As for those457 who own, indeed, that it was made by
God, and yet ascribe to it not a temporal but only a creational beginning, so that in some
scarcely intelligible way the world should always have existed a created world they make an
assertion which seems to them to defend God from the charge of arbitrary hastiness, or of
suddenly conceiving the idea of creating the world as a quite new idea, or of casually changing
His will, though He be unchangeable. But I do not see how this supposition of theirs can
stand in other respects, and chiefly in respect of the soul; for if they contend that it is co-

eternal with God, they will be quite at a loss to explain whence there has accrued to it new
misery, which through a previous eternity had not existed. For if they said that its happiness
and misery ceaselessly alternate, they must say, further, that this alternation will continue
for ever; whence will result this absurdity, that, though the soul is called blessed, it is not so
in this, that it foresees its own misery and disgrace. And yet, if it does not foresee it, and
supposes that it will be neither disgraced nor wretched, but always blessed, then it is blessed
because it is deceived; and a more foolish statement one cannot make. But if their idea is
that the soul’s misery has alternated with its bliss during the ages of the past eternity, but
that now, when once the soul has been set free, it will return henceforth no more to misery,
they are nevertheless of opinion that it has never been truly blessed before, but begins at
last to enjoy a new and uncertain happiness; that is to say, they must acknowledge that some
new thing, and that an important and signal thing, happens to the soul which never in a
whole past eternity happened it before. And if they deny that God’s eternal purpose included
this new experience of the soul, they deny that He is the Author of its blessedness, which is
unspeakable impiety. If, on the other hand, they say that the future blessedness of the soul
is the result of a new decree of God, how will they show that God is not chargeable with that
mutability which displeases them? Further, if they acknowledge that it was created in time,
but will never perish in time,—that it has, like number,458 a beginning but no end,—and
that, therefore, having once made trial of misery, and been delivered from it, it will never
again return thereto, they will certainly admit that this takes place without any violation of
the immutable counsel of God. Let them, then, in like manner believe regarding the world
that it too could be made in time, and yet that God, in making it, did not alter His eternal
design.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—That We Ought Not to Seek to Comprehend the Infinite Ages of Time
Before the World, Nor the Infinite Realms of Space.</head>
<p>Next, we must see what reply can be made to those who agree that God is the Creator
of the world, but have difficulties about the time of its creation, and what reply, also, they
can make to difficulties we might raise about the place of its creation. For, as they demand
why the world was created then and no sooner, we may ask why it was created just here
where it is, and not elsewhere. For if they imagine infinite spaces of time before the world,
during which God could not have been idle, in like manner they may conceive outside the
world infinite realms of space, in which, if any one says that the Omnipotent cannot hold
His hand from working, will it not follow that they must adopt Epicurus’ dream of innumerable
worlds? with this difference only, that he asserts that they are formed and destroyed by
the fortuitous movements of atoms, while they will hold that they are made by God’s hand,
if they maintain that, throughout the boundless immensity of space, stretching interminably
in every direction round the world, God cannot rest, and that the worlds which they suppose
Him to make cannot be destroyed. For here the question is with those who, with ourselves,
believe that God is spiritual, and the Creator of all existences but Himself. As for others, it
is a condescension to dispute with them on a religious ques tion, for they have acquired a
reputation only among men who pay divine honors to a number of gods, and have become
conspicuous among the other philosophers for no other reason than that, though they are
still far from the truth, they are near it in comparison with the rest. While these, then,
neither confine in any place, nor limit, nor distribute the divine substance, but, as is worthy
of God, own it to be wholly though spiritually present everywhere, will they perchance say
that this substance is absent from such immense spaces outside the world, and is occupied
in one only, (and that a very little one compared with the infinity beyond), the one, namely,
in which is the world? I think they will not proceed to this absurdity. Since they maintain
that there is but one world, of vast material bulk, indeed, yet finite, and in its own determinate
position, and that this was made by the working of God, let them give the same account
of God’s resting in the infinite times before the world as they give of His resting in the infinite
spaces outside of it. And as it does not follow that God set the world in the very spot it occupies
and no other by accident rather than by divine reason, although no human reason
can comprehend why it was so set, and though there was no merit in the spot chosen to give
it the precedence of infinite others, so neither does it follow that we should suppose that
God was guided by chance when He created the world in that and no earlier time, although
previous times had been running by during an infinite past, and though there was no difference
by which one time could be chosen in preference to another. But if they say that the
thoughts of men are idle when they conceive infinite places, since there is no place beside
the world, we reply that, by the same showing, it is vain to conceive of the past times of
God’s rest, since there is no time before the world.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—That the World and Time Had Both One Beginning, and the One Did
Not Anticipate the Other.</head>
<p>For if eternity and time are rightly distinguished by this, that time does not exist without
some movement and transition, while in eternity there is no change, who does not see that
there could have been no time had not some creature been made, which by some motion
could give birth to change,—the various parts of which motion and change, as they cannot
be simultaneous, succeed one another,—and thus, in these shorter or longer intervals of
duration, time would begin? Since then, God, in whose eternity is no change at all, is the
Creator and Ordainer of time, I do not see how He can be said to have created the world
after spaces of time had elapsed, unless it be said that prior to the world there was some
creature by whose movement time could pass. And if the sacred and infallible Scriptures
say that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, in order that it may be
understood that He had made nothing previously,—for if He had made anything before the
rest, this thing would rather be said to have been made “in the beginning,”—then assuredly
the world was made, not in time, but simultaneously with time. For that which is made in
time is made both after and before some time,—after that which is past, before that which
is future. But none could then be past, for there was no creature by whose movements its
duration could be measured. But simultaneously with time the world was made, if in the
world’s creation change and motion were created, as seems evident from the order of the
first six or seven days. For in these days the morning and evening are counted, until, on
the sixth day, all things which God then made were finished, and on the seventh the rest of
God was mysteriously and sublimely signalized. What kind of days these were it is extremely
difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to conceive, and how much more to say!</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Of the Nature of the First Days, Which are Said to Have Had Morning
and Evening, Before There Was a Sun.</head>
<p>We see, indeed, that our ordinary days have no evening but by the setting, and no
morning but by the rising, of the sun; but the first three days of all were passed without sun,
since it is reported to have been made on the fourth day. And first of all, indeed, light was
made by the word of God, and God, we read, separated it from the darkness, and called the
light Day, and the darkness Night; but what kind of light that was, and by what periodic
movement it made evening and morning, is beyond the reach of our senses; neither can we
understand how it was, and yet must unhesitatingly believe it. For either it was some material
light, whether proceeding from the upper parts of the world, far removed from our sight,
or from the spot where the sun was afterwards kindled; or under the name of light the holy
city was signified, composed of holy angels and blessed spirits, the city of which the apostle
says, “Jerusalem which is above is our eternal mother in heaven;”459 and in another place,
“For ye are all the children of the light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night,
nor of darkness.”460 Yet in some respects we may appropriately speak of a morning and
evening of this day also. For the knowledge of the creature is, in comparison of the knowledge
of the Creator, but a twilight; and so it dawns and breaks into morning when the creature
is drawn to the praise and love of the Creator; and night never falls when the Creator is not
forsaken through love of the creature. In fine, Scripture, when it would recount those days
in order, never mentions the word night. It never says, “Night was,” but “The evening and
the morning were the first day.” So of the second and the rest. And, indeed, the knowledge
of created things contemplated by themselves is, so to speak, more colorless than when they
are seen in the wisdom of God, as in the art by which they were made. Therefore evening
is a more suitable figure than night; and yet, as I said, morning returns when the creature
returns to the praise and love of the Creator. When it does so in the knowledge of itself,
that is the first day; when in the knowledge of the firmament, which is the name given to
the sky between the waters above and those beneath, that is the second day; when in the
knowledge of the earth, and the sea, and all things that grow out of the earth, that is the
third day; when in the knowledge of the greater and less luminaries, and all the stars, that
is the fourth day; when in the knowledge of all animals that swim in the waters and that fly
in the air, that is the fifth day; when in the knowledge of all animals that live on the earth,
and of man himself, that is the sixth day.461</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—What We are to Understand of God’s Resting on the Seventh Day, After
the Six Days’ Work.</head>
<p>When it is said that God rested on the seventh day from all His works, and hallowed it,
we are not to conceive of this in a childish fashion, as if work were a toil to God, who “spake
and it was done,”—spake by the spiritual and eternal, not audible and transitory word. But
God’s rest signifies the rest of those who rest in God, as the joy of a house means the joy of
those in the house who rejoice, though not the house, but something else, causes the joy.
How much more intelligible is such phraseology, then, if the house itself, by its own beauty,
makes the inhabitants joyful! For in this case we not only call it joyful by that figure of
speech in which the thing containing is used for the thing contained (as when we say, “The
theatres applaud,” “The meadows low,” meaning that the men in the one applaud, and the
oxen in the other low), but also by that figure in which the cause is spoken of as if it were
the effect, as when a letter is said to be joyful, because it makes its readers so. Most appropriately,
therefore, the sacred narrative states that God rested, meaning thereby that those
rest who are in Him, and whom He makes to rest. And this the prophetic narrative promises
also to the men to whom it speaks, and for whom it was written, that they themselves, after
those good works which God does in and by them, if they have managed by faith to get near
to God in this life, shall enjoy in Him eternal rest. This was pre-figured to the ancient people
of God by the rest enjoined in their sabbath law, of which, in its own place, I shall speak
more at large.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—What the Scriptures Teach Us to Believe Concerning the Creation of
the Angels.</head>
<p>At present, since I have undertaken to treat of the origin of the holy city, and first of the
holy angels, who constitute a large part of this city, and indeed the more blessed part, since
they have never been expatriated, I will give myself to the task of explaining, by God’s help,
and as far as seems suitable, the Scriptures which relate to this point. Where Scripture speaks
of the world’s creation, it is not plainly said whether or when the angels were created; but
if mention of them is made, it is implicitly under the name of “heaven,” when it is said, “In
the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,” or perhaps rather under the name
of “light,” of which presently. But that they were wholly omitted, I am unable to believe,
because it is written that God on the seventh day rested from all His works which He made;
and this very book itself begins, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,”
so that before heaven and earth God seems to have made nothing. Since, therefore, He
began with the heavens and the earth,—and the earth itself, as Scripture adds, was at first
invisible and formless, light not being as yet made, and darkness covering the face of the
deep (that is to say, covering an undefined chaos of earth and sea, for where light is not,
darkness must needs be),—and then when all things, which are recorded to have been
completed in six days, were created and arranged, how should the angels be omitted, as if
they were not among the works of God, from which on the seventh day He rested? Yet,
though the fact that the angels are the work of God is not omitted here, it is indeed not explicitly
mentioned; but elsewhere Holy Scripture asserts it in the clearest manner. For in
the Hymn of the Three Children in the Furnace it was said, “O all ye works of the Lord bless
ye the Lord;”462 and among these works mentioned afterwards in detail, the angels are
named. And in the psalm it is said, “Praise ye the Lord from the heavens, praise Him in the
heights. Praise ye Him, all His angels; praise ye Him, all His hosts. Praise ye Him, sun and
moon; praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise Him, ye heaven of heavens; and ye waters that
be above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord; for He commanded, and they
were created.”463 Here the angels are most expressly and by divine authority said to have
been made by God, for of them among the other heavenly things it is said, “He commanded,
and they were created.” Who, then, will be bold enough to suggest that the angels were
made after the six days’ creation? If any one is so foolish, his folly is disposed of by a scripture
of like authority, where God says, “When the stars were made, the angels praised me with
a loud voice.”464 The angels therefore existed before the stars; and the stars were made the
fourth day. Shall we then say that they were made the third day? Far from it; for we know

<pb n="487"/>
what was made that day. The earth was separated from the water, and each element took
its own distinct form, and the earth produced all that grows on it. On the second day, then?
Not even on this; for on it the firmament was made between the waters above and beneath,
and was called “Heaven,” in which firmament the stars were made on the fourth day. There
is no question, then, that if the angels are included in the works of God during these six
days, they are that light which was called “Day,” and whose unity Scripture signalizes by
calling that day not the “first day,” but “one day.”465 For the second day, the third, and the
rest are not other days; but the same “one” day is repeated to complete the number six or
seven, so that there should be knowledge both of God’s works and of His rest. For when
God said, “Let there be light, and there was light,” if we are justified in understanding in
this light the creation of the angels, then certainly they were created partakers of the eternal
light which is the unchangeable Wisdom of God, by which all things were made, and whom
we call the only-begotten Son of God; so that they, being illumined by the Light that created
them, might themselves become light and be called “Day,” in participation of that unchangeable
Light and Day which is the Word of God, by whom both themselves and all else were
made. “The true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,”466—this
Light lighteth also every pure angel, that he may be light not in himself, but in God; from
whom if an angel turn away, he becomes impure, as are all those who are called unclean
spirits, and are no longer light in the Lord, but darkness in themselves, being deprived of
the participation of Light eternal. For evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has
received the name “evil.”467</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Of the Simple and Unchangeable Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
One God, in Whom Substance and Quality are Identical.</head>
<p>There is, accordingly, a good which is alone simple, and therefore alone unchangeable,
and this is God. By this Good have all others been created, but not simple, and therefore
not unchangeable. “Created,” I say,—that is, made, not begotten. For that which is begotten
of the simple Good is simple as itself, and the same as itself. These two we call the Father
and the Son; and both together with the Holy Spirit are one God; and to this Spirit the epithet
Holy is in Scripture, as it were, appropriated. And He is another than the Father and the
Son, for He is neither the Father nor the Son. I say “another,” not “another thing,” because
He is equally with them the simple Good, unchangeable and co-eternal. And this Trinity
is one God; and none the less simple because a Trinity. For we do not say that the nature
of the good is simple, because the Father alone possesses it, or the Son alone, or the Holy
Ghost alone; nor do we say, with the Sabellian heretics, that it is only nominally a Trinity,
and has no real distinction of persons; but we say it is simple, because it is what it has, with
the exception of the relation of the persons to one another. For, in regard to this relation,
it is true that the Father has a Son, and yet is not Himself the Son; and the Son has a Father,
and is not Himself the Father. But, as regards Himself, irrespective of relation to the other,
each is what He has; thus, He is in Himself living, for He has life, and is Himself the Life
which He has.</p>
<p>It is for this reason, then, that the nature of the Trinity is called simple, because it has
not anything which it can lose, and because it is not one thing and its contents another, as
a cup and the liquor, or a body and its color, or the air and the light or heat of it, or a mind
and its wisdom. For none of these is what it has: the cup is not liquor, nor the body color,
nor the air light and heat, nor the mind wisdom. And hence they can be deprived of what
they have, and can be turned or changed into other qualities and states, so that the cup may
be emptied of the liquid of which it is full, the body be discolored, the air darken, the mind
grow silly. The incorruptible body which is promised to the saints in the resurrection cannot,
indeed, lose its quality of incorruption, but the bodily substance and the quality of incorruption
are not the same thing. For the quality of incorruption resides entire in each several
part, not greater in one and less in another; for no part is more incorruptible than another.
The body, indeed, is itself greater in whole than in part; and one part of it is larger, another
smaller, yet is not the larger more incorruptible than the smaller. The body, then, which is
not in each of its parts a whole body, is one thing; incorruptibility, which is throughout
complete, is another thing;—for every part of the incorruptible body, however unequal to
the rest otherwise, is equally incorrupt. For the hand, e.g., is not more incorrupt than the
finger because it is larger than the finger; so, though finger and hand are unequal, their incorruptibility
is equal. Thus, although incorruptibility is inseparable from an incorruptible
body, yet the substance of the body is one thing, the quality of incorruption another. And

<pb n="489"/>
therefore the body is not what it has. The soul itself, too, though it be always wise (as it will
be eternally when it is redeemed), will be so by participating in the unchangeable wisdom,
which it is not; for though the air be never robbed of the light that is shed abroad in it, it is
not on that account the same thing as the light. I do not mean that the soul is air, as has
been supposed by some who could not conceive a spiritual nature;468 but, with much dissimilarity,
the two things have a kind of likeness, which makes it suitable to say that the
immaterial soul is illumined with the immaterial light of the simple wisdom of God, as the
material air is irradiated with material light, and that, as the air, when deprived of this light,
grows dark, (for material darkness is nothing else than air wanting light,469) so the soul,
deprived of the light of wisdom, grows dark.</p>
<p>According to this, then, those things which are essentially and truly divine are called
simple, because in them quality and substance are identical, and because they are divine, or
wise, or blessed in themselves, and without extraneous supplement. In Holy Scripture, it
is true, the Spirit of wisdom is called “manifold”470 because it contains many things in it;
but what it contains it also is, and it being one is all these things. For neither are there many
wisdoms, but one, in which are untold and infinite treasures of things intellectual, wherein
are all invisible and unchangeable reasons of things visible and changeable which were created
by it.471 For God made nothing unwittingly; not even a human workman can be said to do
so. But if He knew all that He made, He made only those things which He had known.
Whence flows a very striking but true conclusion, that this world could not be known to us
unless it existed, but could not have existed unless it had been known to God.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Whether the Angels that Fell Partook of the Blessedness Which the
Holy Angels Have Always Enjoyed from the Time of Their Creation.</head>
<p>And since these things are so, those spirits whom we call angels were never at any time
or in any way darkness, but, as soon as they were made, were made light; yet they were not
so created in order that they might exist and live in any way whatever, but were enlightened
that they might live wisely and blessedly. Some of them, having turned away from this light,
have not won this wise and blessed life, which is certainly eternal, and accompanied with
the sure confidence of its eternity; but they have still the life of reason, though darkened
with folly, and this they cannot lose even if they would. But who can determine to what
extent they were partakers of that wisdom before they fell? And how shall we say that they
participated in it equally with those who through it are truly and fully blessed, resting in a
true certainty of eternal felicity? For if they had equally participated in this true knowledge,
then the evil angels would have remained eternally blessed equally with the good, because
they were equally expectant of it. For, though a life be never so long, it cannot be truly called
eternal if it is destined to have an end; for it is called life inasmuch as it is lived, but eternal
because it has no end. Wherefore, although everything eternal is not therefore blessed (for
hell-fire is eternal), yet if no life can be truly and perfectly blessed except it be eternal, the
life of these angels was not blessed, for it was doomed to end, and therefore not eternal,
whether they knew it or not. In the one case fear, in the other ignorance, prevented them
from being blessed. And even if their ignorance was not so great as to breed in them a
wholly false expectation, but left them wavering in uncertainty whether their good would
be eternal or would some time terminate, this very doubt concerning so grand a destiny was
incompatible with the plenitude of blessedness which we believe the holy angels enjoyed.
For we do not so narrow and restrict the application of the term “blessedness” as to apply
it to God only,472 though doubtless He is so truly blessed that greater blessedness cannot
be; and, in comparison of His blessedness, what is that of the angels, though, according to
their capacity, they be perfectly blessed?</p>
<note type="footnote">472 Vives remarks that the ancients defined blessedness as an absolutely perfect state in all good, peculiar to
God. Perhaps Augustin had a reminiscence of the remarkable discussion in the Tusc. Disp. lib. v., and the
definition, Neque ulla alia huic verbo, quum beatum dicimus, subjecta notio est, nisi, secretis malis omnibus, cumulata
bonorum complexio.</note>

<head>Chapter 12.—A Comparison of the Blessedness of the Righteous, Who Have Not
Yet Received the Divine Reward, with that of Our First Parents in Paradise.</head>
<p>And the angels are not the only members of the rational and intellectual creation whom
we call blessed. For who will take upon him to deny that those first men in Paradise were
blessed previously to sin, although they were uncertain how long their blessedness was to
last, and whether it would be eternal (and eternal it would have been had they not
sinned),—who, I say, will do so, seeing that even now we not unbecomingly call those blessed
whom we see leading a righteous and holy life, in hope of immortality, who have no harrowing
remorse of conscience, but obtain readily divine remission of the sins of their present
infirmity? These, though they are certain that they shall be rewarded if they persevere, are
not certain that they will persevere. For what man can know that he will persevere to the
end in the exercise and increase of grace, unless he has been certified by some revelation
from Him who, in His just and secret judgment, while He deceives none, informs few regarding
this matter? Accordingly, so far as present comfort goes, the first man in Paradise
was more blessed than any just man in this insecure state; but as regards the hope of future
good, every man who not merely supposes, but certainly knows that he shall eternally enjoy
the most high God in the company of angels, and beyond the reach of ill,—this man, no
matter what bodily torments afflict him, is more blessed than was he who, even in that great
felicity of Paradise, was uncertain of his fate.473</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Whether All the Angels Were So Created in One Common State of
Felicity, that Those Who Fell Were Not Aware that They Would Fall, and that
Those Who Stood Received Assurance of Their Own Perseverance After the
Ruin of the Fallen.</head>
<p>From all this, it will readily occur to any one that the blessedness which an intelligent
being desires as its legitimate object results from a combination of these two things, namely,
that it uninterruptedly enjoy the unchangeable good, which is God; and that it be delivered
from all dubiety, and know certainly that it shall eternally abide in the same enjoyment.
That it is so with the angels of light we piously believe; but that the fallen angels, who by
their own default lost that light, did not enjoy this blessedness even before they sinned,
reason bids us conclude. Yet if their life was of any duration before they fell, we must allow
them a blessedness of some kind, though not that which is accompanied with foresight. Or,
if it seems hard to believe that, when the angels were created, some were created in ignorance
either of their perseverance or their fall, while others were most certainly assured of the
eternity of their felicity,—if it is hard to believe that they were not all from the beginning
on an equal footing, until these who are now evil did of their own will fall away from the
light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to believe that the holy angels are now uncertain
of their eternal blessedness, and do not know regarding themselves as much as we have been
able to gather regarding them from the Holy Scriptures. For what catholic Christian does
not know that no new devil will ever arise among the good angels, as he knows that this
present devil will never again return into the fellowship of the good? For the truth in the
gospel promises to the saints and the faithful that they will be equal to the angels of God;
and it is also promised them that they will “go away into life eternal.”474 But if we are certain
that we shall never lapse from eternal felicity, while they are not certain, then we shall not
be their equals, but their superiors. But as the truth never deceives, and as we shall be their
equals, they must be certain of their blessedness. And because the evil angels could not be
certain of that, since their blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either that
the angels were unequal, or that, if equal, the good angels were assured of the eternity of
their blessedness after the perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say that
the words of the Lord about the devil “He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
not in the truth,”475 are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning
of the human race, when man, whom he could kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he
did not abide in the truth from the time of his own creation, and was accordingly never
blessed with the holy angels, but refused to submit to his Creator, and proudly exulted as if
<note type="footnote">474 Matt. xxv. 46.</note>

<pb n="493"/>
in a private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived and deceiving. For the dominion
of the Almighty cannot be eluded; and he who will not piously submit himself to things as
they are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things that does not exist; so that
what the blessed Apostle John says thus becomes intelligible: “The devil sinneth from the
beginning,”476—that is, from the time he was created he refused righteousness, which none
but a will piously subject to God can enjoy. Whoever adopts this opinion at least disagrees
with those heretics the Manichees, and with any other pestilential sect that may suppose
that the devil has derived from some adverse evil principle a nature proper to himself. These
persons are so befooled by error, that, although they acknowledge with ourselves the authority
of the gospels, they do not notice that the Lord did not say, “The devil was naturally a stranger
to the truth,” but “The devil abode not in the truth,” by which He meant us to understand
that he had fallen from the truth, in which, if he had abode, he would have become a partaker
of it, and have remained in blessedness along with the holy angels.477</p>

<p>Moreover, as if we had been inquiring why the devil did not abide in the truth, our Lord
subjoins the reason, saying, “because the truth is not in him.” Now, it would be in him had
he abode in it. But the phraseology is unusual. For, as the words stand, “He abode not in
the truth, because the truth is not in him,” it seems as if the truth’s not being in him were
the cause of his not abiding in it; whereas his not abiding in the truth is rather the cause of
its not being in him. The same form of speech is found in the psalm: “I have called upon
Thee, for Thou hast heard me, O God,”478 where we should expect it to be said, Thou hast
heard me, O God, for I have called upon Thee. But when he had said, “I have called,” then,
as if some one were seeking proof of this, he demonstrates the effectual earnestness of his
prayer by the effect of God’s hearing it; as if he had said, The proof that I have prayed is that
Thou hast heard me.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—How We are to Understand the Words, “The Devil Sinneth from the
Beginning.”</head>
<p>As for what John says about the devil, “The devil sinneth from the beginning”479 they480
who suppose it is meant hereby that the devil was made with a sinful nature, misunderstand
it; for if sin be natural, it is not sin at all. And how do they answer the prophetic
proofs,—either what Isaiah says when he represents the devil under the person of the king
of Babylon, “How art thou fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning!”481 or what Ezekiel says,
“Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering,”482
where it is meant that he was some time without sin; for a little after it is still more explicitly
said, “Thou wast perfect in thy ways?” And if these passages cannot well be otherwise interpreted,
we must understand by this one also, “He abode not in the truth,” that he was once
in the truth, but did not remain in it. And from this passage, “The devil sinneth from the
beginning,” it is not to be supposed that he sinned from the beginning of his created existence,
but from the beginning of his sin, when by his pride he had once commenced to sin. There
is a passage, too, in the Book of Job, of which the devil is the subject: “This is the beginning
of the creation of God, which He made to be a sport to His angels,”483 which agrees with
the psalm, where it is said, “There is that dragon which Thou hast made to be a sport
therein.”484 But these passages are not to lead us to suppose that the devil was originally
created to be the sport of the angels, but that he was doomed to this punishment after his
sin. His beginning, then, is the handiwork of God; for there is no nature, even among the
least, and lowest, and last of the beasts, which was not the work of Him from whom has
proceeded all measure, all form, all order, without which nothing can be planned or conceived.
How much more, then, is this angelic nature, which surpasses in dignity all else that
He has made, the handiwork of the Most High!</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Of the Ranks and Differences of the Creatures, Estimated by Their
Utility, or According to the Natural Gradations of Being.</head>
<p>For, among those beings which exist, and which are not of God the Creator’s essence,
those which have life are ranked above those which have none; those that have the power
of generation, or even of desiring, above those which want this faculty. And, among things
that have life, the sentient are higher than those which have no sensation, as animals are
ranked above trees. And, among the sentient, the intelligent are above those that have not
intelligence,—men, e.g., above cattle. And, among the intelligent, the immortal such as the
angels, above the mortal, such as men. These are the gradations according to the order of
nature; but according to the utility each man finds in a thing, there are various standards
of value, so that it comes to pass that we prefer some things that have no sensation to some
sentient beings. And so strong is this preference, that, had we the power, we would abolish
the latter from nature altogether, whether in ignorance of the place they hold in nature, or,
though we know it, sacrificing them to our own convenience. Who, e.g., would not rather
have bread in his house than mice, gold than fleas? But there is little to wonder at in this,
seeing that even when valued by men themselves (whose nature is certainly of the highest
dignity), more is often given for a horse than for a slave, for a jewel than for a maid. Thus
the reason of one contemplating nature prompts very different judgments from those dictated
by the necessity of the needy, or the desire of the voluptuous; for the former considers what
value a thing in itself has in the scale of creation, while necessity considers how it meets its
need; reason looks for what the mental light will judge to be true, while pleasure looks for
what pleasantly titilates the bodily sense. But of such consequence in rational natures is the
weight, so to speak, of will and of love, that though in the order of nature angels rank above
men, yet, by the scale of justice, good men are of greater value than bad angels.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—That the Flaw of Wickedness is Not Nature, But Contrary to Nature,
and Has Its Origin, Not in the Creator, But in the Will.</head>
<p>It is with reference to the nature, then, and not to the wickedness of the devil, that we
are to understand these words, “This is the beginning of God’s handiwork;”485 for, without
doubt, wickedness can be a flaw or vice486 only where the nature previously was not vitiated.
Vice, too, is so contrary to nature, that it cannot but damage it. And therefore departure
from God would be no vice, unless in a nature whose property it was to abide with God.
So that even the wicked will is a strong proof of the goodness of the nature. But God, as He
is the supremely good Creator of good natures, so is He of evil wills the most just Ruler; so
that, while they make an ill use of good natures, He makes a good use even of evil wills.
Accordingly, He caused the devil (good by God’s creation, wicked by his own will) to be
cast down from his high position, and to become the mockery of His angels,—that is, He
caused his temptations to benefit those whom he wishes to injure by them. And because
God, when He created him, was certainly not ignorant of his future malignity, and foresaw
the good which He Himself would bring out of his evil, therefore says the psalm, “This leviathan
whom Thou hast made to be a sport therein,”487 that we may see that, even while
God in His goodness created him good, He yet had already foreseen and arranged how He
would make use of him when he became wicked.</p>

More Brilliant by the Opposition of Contraries.</head>
<p>For God would never have created any, I do not say angel, but even man, whose future
wickedness He foreknew, unless He had equally known to what uses in behalf of the good
He could turn him, thus embellishing, the course of the ages, as it were an exquisite poem
set off with antitheses. For what are called antitheses are among the most elegant of the
ornaments of speech. They might be called in Latin “oppositions,” or, to speak more accurately,
“contrapositions;” but this word is not in common use among us,488 though the Latin,
and indeed the languages of all nations, avail themselves of the same ornaments of style.
In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians the Apostle Paul also makes a graceful use of antithesis,
in that place where he says, “By the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on
the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and
yet possessing all things.”489 As, then, these oppositions of contraries lend beauty to the
language, so the beauty of the course of this world is achieved by the opposition of contraries,
arranged, as it were, by an eloquence not of words, but of things. This is quite plainly stated
in the Book of Ecclesiasticus, in this way: “Good is set against evil, and life against death:
so is the sinner against the godly. So look upon all the works of the Most High, and these
are two and two, one against another.”490</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—What, Seemingly, We are to Understand by the Words, “God Divided
the Light from the Darkness.”</head>
<p>Accordingly, though the obscurity of the divine word has certainly this advantage, that
it causes many opinions about the truth to be started and discussed, each reader seeing some
fresh meaning in it, yet, whatever is said to be meant by an obscure passage should be either
confirmed by the testimony of obvious facts, or should be asserted in other and less ambiguous
texts. This obscurity is beneficial, whether the sense of the author is at last reached after
the discussion of many other interpretations, or whether, though that sense remain concealed,
other truths are brought out by the discussion of the obscurity. To me it does not seem incongruous
with the working of God, if we understand that the angels were created when
that first light was made, and that a separation was made between the holy and the unclean
angels, when, as is said, “God divided the light from the darkness; and God called the light
Day, and the darkness He called Night.” For He alone could make this discrimination, who
was able also before they fell, to foreknow that they would fall, and that, being deprived of
the light of truth, they would abide in the darkness of pride. For, so far as regards the day
and night, with which we are familiar, He commanded those luminaries of heaven that are
obvious to our senses to divide between the light and the darkness. “Let there be,” He says,
“lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night;” and shortly after
He says, “And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser
light to rule the night: the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to
give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light
from the darkness.”491 But between that light, which is the holy company of the angels
spiritually radiant with the illumination of the truth, and that opposing darkness, which is
the noisome foulness of the spiritual condition of those angels who are turned away from
the light of righteousness, only He Himself could divide, from whom their wickedness (not
of nature, but of will), while yet it was future, could not be hidden or uncertain.</p>

“And God Saw the Light that It Was Good.”</head>
<p>Then, we must not pass from this passage of Scripture without noticing that when God
said, “Let there be light, and there was light,” it was immediately added, “And God saw the
light that it was good.” No such expression followed the statement that He separated the
light from the darkness, and called the light Day and the darkness Night, lest the seal of His
approval might seem to be set on such darkness, as well as on the light. For when the
darkness was not subject of disapprobation, as when it was divided by the heavenly bodies
from this light which our eyes discern, the statement that God saw that it was good is inserted,
not before, but after the division is recorded. “And God set them,” so runs the passage, “in
the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over
the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.” For
He approved of both, because both were sinless. But where God said, “Let there be light,
and there was light; and God saw the light that it was good;” and the narrative goes on, “and
God divided the light from the darkness! and God called the light Day, and the darkness
He called Night,” there was not in this place subjoined the statement, “And God saw that
it was good,” lest both should be designated good, while one of them was evil, not by nature,
but by its own fault. And therefore, in this case, the light alone received the approbation of
the Creator, while the angelic darkness, though it had been ordained, was yet not approved.</p>

Result.</head>
<p>For what else is to be understood by that invariable refrain, “And God saw that it was
good,” than the approval of the work in its design, which is the wisdom of God? For certainly
God did not in the actual achievement of the work first learn that it was good, but, on the
contrary, nothing would have been made had it not been first known by Him. While,
therefore, He sees that that is good which, had He not seen it before it was made, would
never have been made, it is plain that He is not discovering, but teaching that it is good.
Plato, indeed, was bold enough to say that, when the universe was completed, God was, as
it were, elated with joy.492 And Plato was not so foolish as to mean by this that God was
rendered more blessed by the novelty of His creation; but he wished thus to indicate that
the work now completed met with its Maker’s approval, as it had while yet in design. It is
not as if the knowledge of God were of various kinds, knowing in different ways things
which as yet are not, things which are, and things which have been. For not in our fashion
does He look forward to what is future, nor at what is present, nor back upon what is past;
but in a manner quite different and far and profoundly remote from our way of thinking.
For He does not pass from this to that by transition of thought, but beholds all things with
absolute unchangeableness; so that of those things which emerge in time, the future, indeed,
are not yet, and the present are now, and the past no longer are; but all of these are by Him
comprehended in His stable and eternal presence. Neither does He see in one fashion by
the eye, in another by the mind, for He is not composed of mind and body; nor does His
present knowledge differ from that which it ever was or shall be, for those variations of time,
past, present, and future, though they alter our knowledge, do not affect His, “with whom
is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”493 Neither is there any growth from thought
to thought in the conceptions of Him in whose spiritual vision all things which He knows
are at once embraced. For as without any movement that time can measure, He Himself
moves all temporal things, so He knows all times with a knowledge that time cannot measure.
And therefore He saw that what He had made was good, when He saw that it was good to
make it. And when He saw it made, He had not on that account a twofold nor any way increased
knowledge of it; as if He had less knowledge before He made what He saw. For
certainly He would not be the perfect worker He is, unless His knowledge were so perfect
as to receive no addition from His finished works. Wherefore, if the only object had been

to inform us who made the light, it had been enough to say, “God made the light;” and if
further information regarding the means by which it was made had been intended, it would
have sufficed to say, “And God said, Let there be light, and there was light,” that we might
know not only that God had made the world, but also that He had made it by the word.
But because it was right that three leading truths regarding the creature be intimated to us,
viz., who made it, by what means, and why, it is written, “God said, Let there be light, and
there was light. And God saw the light that it was good.” If, then, we ask who made it, it
was “God.” If, by what means, He said “Let it be,” and it was. If we ask, why He made it,
“it was good.” Neither is there any author more excellent than God, nor any skill more efficacious
than the word of God, nor any cause better than that good might be created by
the good God. This also Plato has assigned as the most sufficient reason for the creation of
the world, that good works might be made by a good God;494 whether he read this passage,
or, perhaps, was informed of these things by those who had read them, or, by his quicksighted
genius, penetrated to things spiritual and invisible through the things that are created,
or was instructed regarding them by those who had discerned them.</p>

being free from envy, He desired that all things should, as much as possible, resemble Himself.”</note>

<head>Chapter 22.—Of Those Who Do Not Approve of Certain Things Which are a Part
of This Good Creation of a Good Creator, and Who Think that There is Some
Natural Evil.</head>
<p>This cause, however, of a good creation, namely, the goodness of God,—this cause, I
say, so just and fit, which, when piously and carefully weighed, terminates all the controversies
of those who inquire into the origin of the world, has not been recognized by some
heretics,495 because there are, forsooth, many things, such as fire, frost, wild beasts, and so
forth, which do not suit but injure this thin blooded and frail mortality of our flesh, which
is at present under just punishment. They do not consider how admirable these things are
in their own places, how excellent in their own natures, how beautifully adjusted to the rest
of creation, and how much grace they contribute to the universe by their own contributions
as to a commonwealth; and how serviceable they are even to ourselves, if we use them with
a knowledge of their fit adaptations,—so that even poisons, which are destructive when used
injudiciously, become wholesome and medicinal when used in conformity with their qualities
and design; just as, on the other hand, those things which give us pleasure, such as food,
drink, and the light of the sun, are found to be hurtful when immoderately or unseasonably
used. And thus divine providence admonishes us not foolishly to vituperate things, but to
investigate their utility with care; and, where our mental capacity or infirmity is at fault, to
believe that there is a utility, though hidden, as we have experienced that there were other
things which we all but failed to discover. For this concealment of the use of things is itself
either an exercise of our humility or a levelling of our pride; for no nature at all is evil, and
this is a name for nothing but the want of good. But from things earthly to things heavenly,
from the visible to the invisible, there are some things better than others; and for this purpose
are they unequal, in order that they might all exist. Now God is in such sort a great worker
in great things, that He is not less in little things,—for these little things are to be measured
not by their own greatness (which does not exist), but by the wisdom of their Designer; as,
in the visible appearance of a man, if one eyebrow be shaved off, how nearly nothing is taken
from the body, but how much from the beauty!—for that is not constituted by bulk, but by
the proportion and arrangement of the members. But we do not greatly wonder that persons,
who suppose that some evil nature has been generated and propagated by a kind of opposing
principle proper to it, refuse to admit that the cause of the creation was this, that the good
God produced a good creation. For they believe that He was driven to this enterprise of
creation by the urgent necessity of repulsing the evil that warred against Him, and that He
mixed His good nature with the evil for the sake of restraining and conquering it; and that
this nature of His, being thus shamefully polluted, and most cruelly oppressed and held
captive, He labors to cleanse and deliver it, and with all His pains does not wholly succeed;
<note type="footnote">495 The Manichæans, to wit.</note>

<pb n="504"/>
but such part of it as could not be cleansed from that defilement is to serve as a prison and
chain of the conquered and incarcerated enemy. The Manichæans would not drivel, or
rather, rave in such a style as this, if they believed the nature of God to be, as it is, unchangeable
and absolutely incorruptible, and subject to no injury; and if, moreover, they held in
Christian sobriety, that the soul which has shown itself capable of being altered for the worse
by its own will, and of being corrupted by sin, and so, of being deprived of the light of
eternal truth,—that this soul, I say, is not a part of God, nor of the same nature as God, but
is created by Him, and is far different from its Creator.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Of the Error in Which the Doctrine of Origen is Involved.</head>
<p>But it is much more surprising that some even of those who, with ourselves, believe that
there is one only source of all things, and that no nature which is not divine can exist unless
originated by that Creator, have yet refused to accept with a good and simple faith this so
good and simple a reason of the world’s creation, that a good God made it good; and that
the things created, being different from God, were inferior to Him, and yet were good, being
created by none other than He. But they say that souls, though not, indeed, parts of God,
but created by Him, sinned by abandoning God; that, in proportion to their various sins,
they merited different degrees of debasement from heaven to earth, and diverse bodies as
prison-houses; and that this is the world, and this the cause of its creation, not the production
of good things, but the restraining of evil. Origen is justly blamed for holding this opinion.
For in the books which he entitles περὶ αρχῶν, that is, Of Origins, this is his sentiment, this
his utterance. And I can not sufficiently express my astonishment, that a man so erudite
and well versed in ecclesiastical literature, should not have observed, in the first place, how
opposed this is to the meaning of this authoritative Scripture, which, in recounting all the
works of God, regularly adds, “And God saw that it was good;” and, when all were completed,
inserts the words, “And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very
good.”496 Was it not obviously meant to be understood that there was no other cause of
the world’s creation than that good creatures should be made by a good God? In this creation,
had no one sinned, the world would have been filled and beautified with natures good
without exception; and though there is sin, all things are not therefore full of sin, for the
great majority of the heavenly inhabitants preserve their nature’s integrity. And the sinful
will though it violated the order of its own nature, did not on that account escape the laws
of God, who justly orders all things for good. For as the beauty of a picture is increased by
well-managed shadows, so, to the eye that has skill to discern it, the universe is beautified
even by sinners, though, considered by themselves, their deformity is a sad blemish.</p>
<p>In the second place, Origen, and all who think with him, ought to have seen that if it
were the true opinion that the world was created in order that souls might, for their sins,
be accommodated with bodies in which they should be shut up as in houses of correction,
the more venial sinners receiving lighter and more ethereal bodies, while the grosser and
graver sinners received bodies more crass and grovelling, then it would follow that the
devils, who are deepest in wickedness, ought, rather than even wicked men, to have earthly
bodies, since these are the grossest and least ethereal of all. But in point of fact, that we
might see that the deserts of souls are not to be estimated by the qualities of bodies, the
wickedest devil possesses an ethereal body, while man, wicked, it is true, but with a
wickedness small and venial in comparison with his, received even before his sin a body of
<note type="footnote">496 Gen. i. 31.</note>

<pb n="506"/>
clay. And what more foolish assertion can be advanced than that God, by this sun of ours,
did not design to benefit the material creation, or lend lustre to its loveliness, and therefore
created one single sun for this single world, but that it so happened that one soul only had
so sinned as to deserve to be enclosed in such a body as it is? On this principle, if it had
chanced that not one, but two, yea, or ten, or a hundred had sinned similarly, and with a
like degree of guilt, then this world would have one hundred suns. And that such is not the
case, is due not to the considerate foresight of the Creator, contriving the safety and beauty
of things material, but rather to the fact that so fine a quality of sinning was hit upon by
only one soul, so that it alone has merited such a body. Manifestly persons holding such
opinions should aim at confining, not souls of which they know not what they say, but
themselves, lest they fall, and deservedly, far indeed from the truth. And as to these three
answers which I formerly recommended when in the case of any creature the questions are
put, Who made it? By what means? Why? that it should be replied, God, By the Word, Because
it was good,—as to these three answers, it is very questionable whether the Trinity itself
is thus mystically indicated, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, or whether
there is some good reason for this acceptation in this passage of Scripture,—this, I say, is
questionable, and one can’t be expected to explain everything in one volume.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Of the Divine Trinity, and the Indications of Its Presence Scattered
Everywhere Among Its Works.</head>
<p>We believe, we maintain, we faithfully preach, that the Father begat the Word, that is,
Wisdom, by which all things were made, the only-begotten Son, one as the Father is one,
eternal as the Father is eternal, and, equally with the Father, supremely good; and that the
Holy Spirit is the Spirit alike of Father and of Son, and is Himself consubstantial and coeternal
with both; and that this whole is a Trinity by reason of the individuality497 of the
persons, and one God by reason of the indivisible divine substance, as also one Almighty
by reason of the indivisible omnipotence; yet so that, when we inquire regarding each singly,
it is said that each is God and Almighty; and, when we speak of all together, it is said that
there are not three Gods, nor three Almighties, but one God Almighty; so great is the indivisible
unity of these Three, which requires that it be so stated. But, whether the Holy
Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, who are both good, can be with propriety called the
goodness of both, because He is common to both, I do not presume to determine hastily.
Nevertheless, I would have less hesitation in saying that He is the holiness of both, not as
if He were a divine attribute merely, but Himself also the divine substance, and the third
person in the Trinity. I am the rather emboldened to make this statement, because, though
the Father is a spirit, and the Son a spirit, and the Father holy, and the Son holy, yet the
third person is distinctively called the Holy Spirit, as if He were the substantial holiness
consubstantial with the other two. But if the divine goodness is nothing else than the divine
holiness, then certainly it is a reasonable studiousness, and not presumptuous intrusion, to
inquire whether the same Trinity be not hinted at in an enigmatical mode of speech, by
which our inquiry is stimulated, when it is written who made each creature, and by what
means, and why. For it is the Father of the Word who said, Let there be. And that which
was made when He spoke was certainly made by means of the Word. And by the words,
“God saw that it was good,” it is sufficiently intimated that God made what was made not
from any necessity, nor for the sake of supplying any want, but solely from His own goodness,
i.e., because it was good. And this is stated after the creation had taken place, that there
might be no doubt that the thing made satisfied the goodness on account of which it was
made. And if we are right in understanding; that this goodness is the Holy Spirit, then the
whole Trinity is revealed to us in the creation. In this, too, is the origin, the enlightenment,
the blessedness of the holy city which is above among the holy angels. For if we inquire
whence it is, God created it; or whence its wisdom, God illumined it; or whence its
blessedness, God is its bliss. It has its form by subsisting in Him; its enlightenment by

<head>Chapter 25.—Of the Division of Philosophy into Three Parts.</head>
<p>As far as one can judge, it is for the same reason that philosophers have aimed at a
threefold division of science, or rather, were enabled to see that there was a threefold division
(for they did not invent, but only discovered it), of which one part is called physical, another
logical, the third ethical. The Latin equivalents of these names are now naturalized in the
writings of many authors, so that these divisions are called natural, rational, and moral, on
which I have touched slightly in the eighth book. Not that I would conclude that these
philosophers, in this threefold division, had any thought of a trinity in God, although Plato
is said to have been the first to discover and promulgate this distribution, and he saw that
God alone could be the author of nature, the bestower of intelligence, and the kindler of
love by which life becomes good and blessed. But certain it is that, though philosophers
disagree both regarding the nature of things, and the mode of investigating truth, and of
the good to which all our actions ought to tend, yet in these three great general questions
all their intellectual energy is spent. And though there be a confusing diversity of opinion,
every man striving to establish his own opinion in regard to each of these questions, yet no
one of them all doubts that nature has some cause, science some method, life some end and
aim. Then, again, there are three things which every artificer must possess if he is to effect
anything,—nature, education, practice. Nature is to be judged by capacity, education by
knowledge, practice by its fruit. I am aware that, properly speaking, fruit is what one enjoys,
use [practice] what one uses. And this seems to be the difference between them, that we
are said to enjoy that which in itself, and irrespective of other ends, delights us; to use that
which we seek for the sake of some end beyond. For which reason the things of time are to
be used rather than enjoyed, that we may deserve to enjoy things eternal; and not as those
perverse creatures who would fain enjoy money and use God,—not spending money for
God’s sake, but worshipping God for money’s sake. However, in common parlance, we
both use fruits and enjoy uses. For we correctly speak of the “fruits of the field,” which
certainly we all use in the present life. And it was in accordance with this usage that I said
that there were three things to be observed in a man, nature, education, practice. From
these the philosophers have elaborated, as I said, the threefold division of that science by
which a blessed life is attained: the natural having respect to nature, the rational to education,
the moral to practice. If, then, we were ourselves the authors of our nature, we should have
generated knowledge in ourselves, and should not require to reach it by education, i.e., by
learning it from others. Our love, too, proceeding from ourselves and returning to us, would
suffice to make our life blessed, and would stand in need of no extraneous enjoyment. But
now, since our nature has God as its requisite author, it is certain that we must have Him
for our teacher that we may be wise; Him, too, to dispense to us spiritual sweetness that we
may be blessed.</p>

<pb n="510"/>
<head>Chapter 26.—Of the Image of the Supreme Trinity, Which We Find in Some Sort
in Human Nature Even in Its Present State.</head>
<p>And we indeed recognize in ourselves the image of God, that is, of the supreme Trinity,
an image which, though it be not equal to God, or rather, though it be very far removed
from Him,—being neither co-eternal, nor, to say all in a word, consubstantial with Him,—is
yet nearer to Him in nature than any other of His works, and is destined to be yet restored,
that it may bear a still closer resemblance. For we both are, and know that we are, and delight
in our being, and our knowledge of it. Moreover, in these three things no true-seeming illusion
disturbs us; for we do not come into contact with these by some bodily sense, as we
perceive the things outside of us,—colors, e.g., by seeing, sounds by hearing, smells by
smelling, tastes by tasting, hard and soft objects by touching,—of all which sensible objects
it is the images resembling them, but not themselves which we perceive in the mind and
hold in the memory, and which excite us to desire the objects. But, without any delusive
representation of images or phantasms, I am most certain that I am, and that I know and
delight in this. In respect of these truths, I am not at all afraid of the arguments of the
Academicians, who say, What if you are deceived? For if I am deceived, I am.498 For he
who is not, cannot be deceived; and if I am deceived, by this same token I am. And since I
am if I am deceived, how am I deceived in believing that I am? for it is certain that I am if
I am deceived. Since, therefore, I, the person deceived, should be, even if I were deceived,
certainly I am not deceived in this knowledge that I am. And, consequently, neither am I
deceived in knowing that I know. For, as I know that I am, so I know this also, that I know.
And when I love these two things, I add to them a certain third thing, namely, my love,
which is of equal moment. For neither am I deceived in this, that I love, since in those things
which I love I am not deceived; though even if these were false, it would still be true that I
loved false things. For how could I justly be blamed and prohibited from loving false things,
if it were false that I loved them? But, since they are true and real, who doubts that when
they are loved, the love of them is itself true and real? Further, as there is no one who does
not wish to be happy, so there is no one who does not wish to be. For how can he be happy,
if he is nothing?</p>

<p>And truly the very fact of existing is by some natural spell so pleasant, that even the
wretched are, for no other reason, unwilling to perish; and, when they feel that they are
wretched, wish not that they themselves be annihilated, but that their misery be so. Take
even those who, both in their own esteem, and in point of fact, are utterly wretched, and
who are reckoned so, not only by wise men on account of their folly, but by those who count
themselves blessed, and who think them wretched because they are poor and destitute,—if
any one should give these men an immortality, in which their misery should be deathless,
and should offer the alternative, that if they shrank from existing eternally in the same misery
they might be annihilated, and exist nowhere at all, nor in any condition, on the instant
they would joyfully, nay exultantly, make election to exist always, even in such a condition,
rather than not exist at all. The well-known feeling of such men witnesses to this. For when
we see that they fear to die, and will rather live in such misfortune than end it by death, is
it not obvious enough how nature shrinks from annihilation? And, accordingly, when they
know that they must die, they seek, as a great boon, that this mercy be shown them, that
they may a little longer live in the same misery, and delay to end it by death. And so they
indubitably prove with what glad alacrity they would accept immortality, even though it
secured to them endless destruction. What! do not even all irrational animals, to whom
such calculations are unknown, from the huge dragons down to the least worms, all testify
that they wish to exist, and therefore shun death by every movement in their power? Nay,
the very plants and shrubs, which have no such life as enables them to shun destruction by
movements we can see, do not they all seek in their own fashion to conserve their existence,
by rooting themselves more and more deeply in the earth, that so they may draw nourishment,
and throw out healthy branches towards the sky? In fine, even the lifeless bodies,
which want not only sensation but seminal life, yet either seek the upper air or sink deep,
or are balanced in an intermediate position, so that they may protect their existence in that
situation where they can exist in most accordance with their nature.</p>
<p>And how much human nature loves the knowledge of its existence, and how it shrinks
from being deceived, will be sufficiently understood from this fact, that every man prefers
to grieve in a sane mind, rather than to be glad in madness. And this grand and wonderful
instinct belongs to men alone of all animals; for, though some of them have keener eyesight
than ourselves for this world’s light, they cannot attain to that spiritual light with which our
mind is somehow irradiated, so that we can form right judgments of all things. For our
power to judge is proportioned to our acceptance of this light. Nevertheless, the irrational
animals, though they have not knowledge, have certainly something resembling knowledge;
whereas the other material things are said to be sensible, not because they have senses, but
because they are the objects of our senses. Yet among plants, their nourishment and generation
have some resemblance to sensible life. However, both these and all material things

<pb n="512"/>
have their causes hidden in their nature; but their outward forms, which lend beauty to this
visible structure of the world, are perceived by our senses, so that they seem to wish to
compensate for their own want of knowledge by providing us with knowledge. But we
perceive them by our bodily senses in such a way that we do not judge of them by these
senses. For we have another and far superior sense, belonging to the inner man, by which
we perceive what things are just, and what unjust,—just by means of an intelligible idea,
unjust by the want of it. This sense is aided in its functions neither by the eyesight, nor by
the orifice of the ear, nor by the air-holes of the nostrils, nor by the palate’s taste, nor by any
bodily touch. By it I am assured both that I am, and that I know this; and these two I love,
and in the same manner I am assured that I love them.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Whether We Ought to Love the Love Itself with Which We Love Our
Existence and Our Knowledge of It, that So We May More Nearly Resemble the
Image of the Divine Trinity.</head>
<p>We have said as much as the scope of this work demands regarding these two things,
to wit, our existence, and our knowledge of it, and how much they are loved by us, and how
there is found even in the lower creatures a kind of likeness of these things, and yet with a
difference. We have yet to speak of the love wherewith they are loved, to determine
whether this love itself is loved. And doubtless it is; and this is the proof. Because in men
who are justly loved, it is rather love itself that is loved; for he is not justly called a good man
who knows what is good, but who loves it. Is it not then obvious that we love in ourselves
the very love wherewith we love whatever good we love? For there is also a love wherewith
we love that which we ought not to love; and this love is hated by him who loves that
wherewith he loves what ought to be loved. For it is quite possible for both to exist in one
man. And this co-existence is good for a man, to the end that this love which conduces to
our living well may grow, and the other, which leads us to evil may decrease, until our whole
life be perfectly healed and transmuted into good. For if we were beasts, we should love the
fleshly and sensual life, and this would be our sufficient good; and when it was well with us
in respect of it, we should seek nothing beyond. In like manner, if we were trees, we could
not, indeed, in the strict sense of the word, love anything; nevertheless we should seem, as
it were, to long for that by which we might become more abundantly and luxuriantly fruitful.
If we were stones, or waves, or wind, or flame, or anything of that kind, we should want,
indeed, both sensation and life, yet should possess a kind of attraction towards our own
proper position and natural order. For the specific gravity of bodies is, as it were, their love,
whether they are carried downwards by their weight, or upwards by their levity. For the
body is borne by its gravity, as the spirit by love, whithersoever it is borne.499 But we are
men, created in the image of our Creator, whose eternity is true, and whose truth is eternal,
whose love is eternal and true, and who Himself is the eternal, true, and adorable Trinity,
without confusion, without separation; and, therefore, while, as we run over all the works
which He has established, we may detect, as it were, His footprints, now more and now less
distinct even in those things that are beneath us, since they could not so much as exist, or
be bodied forth in any shape, or follow and observe any law, had they not been made by
Him who supremely is, and is supremely good and supremely wise; yet in ourselves beholding
His image, let us, like that younger son of the gospel, come to ourselves, and arise and return
to Him from whom by our sin we had departed. There our being will have no death, our
knowledge no error, our love no mishap. But now, though we are assured of our possession
of these three things, not on the testimony of others, but by our own consciousness of their

presence, and because we see them with our own most truthful interior vision, yet, as we
cannot of our selves know how long they are to continue, and whether they shall never
cease to be, and what issue their good or bad use will lead to, we seek for others who can
acquaint us of these things, if we have not already found them. Of the trustworthiness of
these witnesses, there will, not now, but subsequently, be an opportunity of speaking. But
in this book let us go on as we have begun, with God’s help, to speak of the city of God, not
in its state of pilgrimage and mortality, but as it exists ever immortal in the heavens,—that
is, let us speak of the holy angels who maintain their allegiance to God, who never were, nor
ever shall be, apostate, between whom and those who forsook light eternal and became
darkness, God, as we have already said, made at the first a separation.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—Of the Knowledge by Which the Holy Angels Know God in His Essence,
and by Which They See the Causes of His Works in the Art of the Worker, Before
They See Them in the Works of the Artist.</head>
<p>Those holy angels come to the knowledge of God not by audible words, but by the
presence to their souls of immutable truth, i.e., of the only-begotten Word of God; and they
know this Word Himself, and the Father, and their Holy Spirit, and that this Trinity is indivisible,
and that the three persons of it are one substance, and that there are not three Gods
but one God; and this they so know that it is better understood by them than we are by
ourselves. Thus, too, they know the creature also, not in itself, but by this better way, in the
wisdom of God, as if in the art by which it was created; and, consequently, they know
themselves better in God than in themselves, though they have also this latter knowledge.
For they were created, and are different from their Creator. In Him, therefore, they have,
as it were, a noonday knowledge; in themselves, a twilight knowledge, according to our
former explanations.500 For there is a great difference between knowing a thing in the
design in conformity to which it was made, and knowing it in itself,—e.g., the straightness
of lines and correctness of figures is known in one way when mentally conceived, in another
when described on paper; and justice is known in one way in the unchangeable truth, in
another in the spirit of a just man. So is it with all other things,—as, the firmament between
the water above and below, which was called the heaven; the gathering of the waters beneath,
and the laying bare of the dry land, and the production of plants and trees; the creation of
sun, moon, and stars; and of the animals out of the waters, fowls, and fish, and monsters of
the deep; and of everything that walks or creeps on the earth, and of man himself, who excels
all that is on the earth,—all these things are known in one way by the angels in the Word
of God, in which they see the eternally abiding causes and reasons according to which they
were made, and in another way in themselves: in the former, with a clearer knowledge; in
the latter, with a knowledge dimmer, and rather of the bare works than of the design. Yet,
when these works are referred to the praise and adoration of the Creator Himself, it is as if
morning dawned in the minds of those who contemplate them.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—Of the Perfection of the Number Six, Which is the First of the Numbers
Which is Composed of Its Aliquot Parts.</head>
<p>These works are recorded to have been completed in six days (the same day being six
times repeated), because six is a perfect number,—not because God required a protracted
time, as if He could not at once create all things, which then should mark the course of time
by the movements proper to them, but because the perfection of the works was signified by
the number six. For the number six is the first which is made up of its own501 parts, i.e.,
of its sixth, third, and half, which are respectively one, two, and three, and which make a
total of six. In this way of looking at a number, those are said to be its parts which exactly
divide it, as a half, a third, a fourth, or a fraction with any denominator, e.g., four is a part
of nine, but not therefore an aliquot part; but one is, for it is the ninth part; and three is, for
it is the third. Yet these two parts, the ninth and the third, or one and three, are far from
making its whole sum of nine. So again, in the number ten, four is a part, yet does not divide
it; but one is an aliquot part, for it is a tenth; so it has a fifth, which is two; and a half, which
is five. But these three parts, a tenth, a fifth, and a half, or one, two, and five, added together,
do not make ten, but eight. Of the number twelve, again, the parts added together exceed
the whole; for it has a twelfth, that is, one; a sixth, or two; a fourth, which is three; a third,
which is four; and a half, which is six. But one, two, three, four, and six make up, not twelve,
but more, viz., sixteen. So much I have thought fit to state for the sake of illustrating the
perfection of the number six, which is, as I said, the first which is exactly made up of its own
parts added together; and in this number of days God finished His work.502 And, therefore,
we must not despise the science of numbers, which, in many passages of holy Scripture, is
found to be of eminent service to the careful interpreter.503 Neither has it been without
reason numbered among God’s praises, “Thou hast ordered all things in number, and
measure, and weight.”504</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Of the Seventh Day, in Which Completeness and Repose are Celebrated.</head>
<p>But, on the seventh day (i.e., the same day repeated seven times, which number is also
a perfect one, though for another reason), the rest of God is set forth, and then, too, we first
hear of its being hallowed. So that God did not wish to hallow this day by His works, but
by His rest, which has no evening, for it is not a creature; so that, being known in one way
in the Word of God, and in another in itself, it should make a twofold knowledge, daylight
and dusk (day and evening). Much more might be said about the perfection of the number
seven, but this book is already too long, and I fear lest I should seem to catch at an opportunity
of airing my little smattering of science more childishly than profitably. I must speak,
therefore, in moderation and with dignity, lest, in too keenly following “number,” I be accused
of forgetting “weight” and “measure.” Suffice it here to say, that three is the first whole
number that is odd, four the first that is even, and of these two, seven is composed. On this
account it is often put for all numbers together, as, “A just man falleth seven times, and riseth
up again,”505—that is, let him fall never so often, he will not perish (and this was meant to
be understood not of sins, but of afflictions conducing to lowliness). Again, “Seven times
a day will I praise Thee,”506 which elsewhere is expressed thus, “I will bless the Lord at all
times.”507 And many such instances are found in the divine authorities, in which the
number seven is, as I said, commonly used to express the whole, or the completeness of
anything. And so the Holy Spirit, of whom the Lord says, “He will teach you all truth,”508
is signified by this number.509 In it is the rest of God, the rest His people find in Him. For
rest is in the whole, i.e., in perfect completeness, while in the part there is labor. And thus
we labor as long as we know in part; “but when that which is perfect is come, then that which
is in part shall be done away.”510 It is even with toil we search into the Scriptures themselves.
But the holy angels, towards whose society and assembly we sigh while in this our toilsome
pilgrimage, as they already abide in their eternal home, so do they enjoy perfect facility of
knowledge and felicity of rest. It is without difficulty that they help us; for their spiritual
movements, pure and free, cost them no effort.</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—Of the Opinion that the Angels Were Created Before the World.</head>
<p>But if some one oppose our opinion, and say that the holy angels are not referred to
when it is said, “Let there be light, and there was light;” if he suppose or teach that some
material light, then first created, was meant, and that the angels were created, not only before
the firmament dividing the waters and named “the heaven,” but also before the time signified
in the words, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;” if he allege that this
phrase, “In the beginning,” does not mean that nothing was made before (for the angels
were), but that God made all things by His Wisdom or Word, who is named in Scripture
“the Beginning,” as He Himself, in the gospel, replied to the Jews when they asked Him who
He was, that He was the Beginning;511—I will not contest the point, chiefly because it gives
me the liveliest satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated in the very beginning of the book
of Genesis. For having said “In the Beginning God created the heaven and the earth,”
meaning that the Father made them in the Son (as the psalm testifies where it says, “How
manifold are Thy works, O Lord! in Wisdom hast Thou made them all”512), a little afterwards
mention is fitly made of the Holy Spirit also. For, when it had been told us what kind of
earth God created at first, or what the mass or matter was which God, under the name of
“heaven and earth,” had provided for the construction of the world, as is told in the additional
words, “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face
of the deep,” then, for the sake of completing the mention of the Trinity, it is immediately
added, “And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” Let each one, then, take
it as he pleases; for it is so profound a passage, that it may well suggest, for the exercise of
the reader’s tact, many opinions, and none of them widely departing from the rule of faith.
At the same time, let none doubt that the holy angels in their heavenly abodes are, though
not, indeed, co-eternal with God, yet secure and certain of eternal and true felicity. To their
company the Lord teaches that His little ones belong; and not only says, “They shall be equal
to the angels of God,”513 but shows, too, what blessed contemplation the angels themselves
enjoy, saying, “Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, that
in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.”514</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—Of the Two Different and Dissimilar Communities of Angels, Which
are Not Inappropriately Signified by the Names Light and Darkness.</head>
<p>That certain angels sinned, and were thrust down to the lowest parts of this world, where
they are, as it were, incarcerated till their final damnation in the day of judgment, the Apostle
Peter very plainly declares, when he says that “God spared not the angels that sinned, but
cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved into
judgment.”515 Who, then, can doubt that God, either in foreknowledge or in act, separated
between these and the rest? And who will dispute that the rest are justly called “light?” For
even we who are yet living by faith, hoping only and not yet enjoying equality with them,
are already called “light” by the apostle: “For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
light in the Lord.”516 But as for these apostate angels, all who understand or believe them
to be worse than unbelieving men are well aware that they are called “darkness.” Wherefore,
though light and darkness are to be taken in their literal signification in these passages of
Genesis in which it is said, “God said, Let there be light, and there was light,” and “God divided
the light from the darkness,” yet, for our part, we understand these two societies of
angels,—the one enjoying God, the other swelling with pride; the one to whom it is said,
“Praise ye Him, all His angels,”517 the other whose prince says, “All these things will I give
Thee if Thou wilt fall down and worship me;”518 the one blazing with the holy love of God,
the other reeking with the unclean lust of self-advancement. And since, as it is written,
“God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,”519 we may say, the one
dwelling in the heaven of heavens, the other cast thence, and raging through the lower regions
of the air; the one tranquil in the brightness of piety, the other tempest-tossed with beclouding
desires; the one, at God’s pleasure, tenderly succoring, justly avenging,—the other, set on
by its own pride, boiling with the lust of subduing and hurting; the one the minister of God’s
goodness to the utmost of their good pleasure, the other held in by God’s power from doing
the harm it would; the former laughing at the latter when it does good unwillingly by its
persecutions, the latter envying the former when it gathers in its pilgrims. These two angelic
communities, then, dissimilar and contrary to one another, the one both by nature good
and by will upright, the other also good by nature but by will depraved, as they are exhibited
in other and more explicit passages of holy writ, so I think they are spoken of in this book
of Genesis under the names of light and darkness; and even if the author perhaps had a
different meaning, yet our discussion of the obscure language has not been wasted time;

<pb n="520"/>
for, though we have been unable to discover his meaning, yet we have adhered to the rule
of faith, which is sufficiently ascertained by the faithful from other passages of equal authority.
For, though it is the material works of God which are here spoken of, they have certainly
a resemblance to the spiritual, so that Paul can say, “Ye are all the children of light, and the
children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.”520 If, on the other hand, the
author of Genesis saw in the words what we see, then our discussion reaches this more satisfactory
conclusion, that the man of God, so eminently and divinely wise, or rather, that
the Spirit of God who by him recorded God’s works which were finished on the sixth day,
may be supposed not to have omitted all mention of the angels whether he included them
in the words “in the beginning,” because He made them first, or, which seems most likely,
because He made them in the only-begotten Word. And, under these names heaven and
earth, the whole creation is signified, either as divided into spiritual and material, which
seems the more likely, or into the two great parts of the world in which all created things
are contained, so that, first of all, the creation is presented in sum, and then its parts are
enumerated according to the mystic number of the days.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—Of the Idea that the Angels Were Meant Where the Separation of the
Waters by the Firmament is Spoken Of, and of that Other Idea that the Waters
Were Not Created.</head>
<p>Some,521 however, have supposed that the angelic hosts are somehow referred to under
the name of waters, and that this is what is meant by “Let there be a firmament in the midst
of the waters:”522 that the waters above should be understood of the angels, and those below
either of the visible waters, or of the multitude of bad angels, or of the nations of men. If
this be so, then it does not here appear when the angels were created, but when they were
separated. Though there have not been wanting men foolish and wicked enough523 to deny
that the waters were made by God, because it is nowhere written, “God said, Let there be
waters.” With equal folly they might say the same of the earth, for nowhere do we read,
“God said, Let the earth be.” But, say they, it is written, “In the beginning God created the
heaven and the earth.” Yes, and there the water is meant, for both are included in one word.
For “the sea is His,” as the psalm says, “and He made it; and His hands formed the dry
land.”524 But those who would understand the angels by the waters above the skies have a
difficulty about the specific gravity of the elements, and fear that the waters, owing to their
fluidity and weight, could not be set in the upper parts of the world. So that, if they were
to construct a man upon their own principles, they would not put in his head any moist
humors, or “phlegm” as the Greeks call it, and which acts the part of water among the elements
of our body. But, in God’s handiwork, the head is the seat of the phlegm, and surely
most fitly; and yet, according to their supposition, so absurdly that if we were not aware of
the fact, and were informed by this same record that God had put a moist and cold and
therefore heavy humor in the uppermost part of man’s body, these world-weighers would
refuse belief. And if they were confronted with the authority of Scripture, they would
maintain that something else must be meant by the words. But, were we to investigate and
discover all the details which are written in this divine book regarding the creation of the
world, we should have much to say, and should widely digress from the proposed aim of
this work. Since, then, we have now said what seemed needful regarding these two diverse
and contrary communities of angels, in which the origin of the two human communities
(of which we intend to speak anon) is also found, let us at once bring this book also to a
conclusion.</p>

<p>Argument—Augustin first institutes two inquiries regarding the angels; namely, whence
is there in some a good, and in others an evil will? and, what is the reason of the blessedness
of the good, and the misery of the evil? Afterwards he treats of the creation of man, and teaches
that he is not from eternity, but was created, and by none other than God.</p>
            
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="523"/>
<head>Chapter 1.—That the Nature of the Angels, Both Good and Bad, is One and the
Same.</head>
<p>It has already, in the preceding book, been shown how the two cities originated among
the angels. Before I speak of the creation of man, and show how the cities took their rise so
far as regards the race of rational mortals I see that I must first, so far as I can, adduce what
may demonstrate that it is not incongruous and unsuitable to speak of a society composed
of angels and men together; so that there are not four cities or societies,—two, namely, of
angels, and as many of men,—but rather two in all, one composed of the good, the other of
the wicked, angels or men indifferently.</p>
<p>That the contrary propensities in good and bad angels have arisen, not from a difference
in their nature and origin, since God, the good Author and Creator of all essences, created
them both, but from a difference in their wills and desires, it is impossible to doubt. While
some steadfastly continued in that which was the common good of all, namely, in God
Himself, and in His eternity, truth, and love; others, being enamored rather of their own
power, as if they could be their own good, lapsed to this private good of their own, from
that higher and beatific good which was common to all, and, bartering the lofty dignity of
eternity for the inflation of pride, the most assured verity for the slyness of vanity, uniting
love for factious partisanship, they became proud, deceived, envious. The cause, therefore,
of the blessedness of the good is adherence to God. And so the cause of the others’ misery
will be found in the contrary, that is, in their not adhering to God. Wherefore, if when the
question is asked, why are the former blessed, it is rightly answered, because they adhere to
God; and when it is asked, why are the latter miserable, it is rightly answered, because they
do not adhere to God,—then there is no other good for the rational or intellectual creature
save God only. Thus, though it is not every creature that can be blessed (for beasts, trees,
stones, and things of that kind have not this capacity), yet that creature which has the capacity
cannot be blessed of itself, since it is created out of nothing, but only by Him by whom it
has been created. For it is blessed by the possession of that whose loss makes it miserable.
He, then, who is blessed not in another, but in himself, cannot be miserable, because he
cannot lose himself.</p>
<p>Accordingly we say that there is no unchangeable good but the one, true, blessed God;
that the things which He made are indeed good because from Him, yet mutable because
made not out of Him, but out of nothing. Although, therefore, they are not the supreme
good, for God is a greater good, yet those mutable things which can adhere to the immutable
good, and so be blessed, are very good; for so completely is He their good, that without Him
they cannot but be wretched. And the other created things in the universe are not better
on this account, that they cannot be miserable. For no one would say that the other members

<pb n="524"/>
of the body are superior to the eyes, because they cannot be blind. But as the sentient nature,
even when it feels pain, is superior to the stony, which can feel none, so the rational nature,
even when wretched, is more excellent than that which lacks reason or feeling, and can
therefore experience no misery. And since this is so, then in this nature which has been
created so excellent, that though it be mutable itself, it can yet secure its blessedness by adhering
to the immutable good, the supreme God; and since it is not satisfied unless it be
perfectly blessed, and cannot be thus blessed save in God,—in this nature, I say, not to adhere
to God, is manifestly a fault.525 Now every fault injures the nature, and is consequently
contrary to the nature. The creature, therefore, which cleaves to God, differs from those
who do not, not by nature, but by fault; and yet by this very fault the nature itself is proved
to be very noble and admirable. For that nature is certainly praised, the fault of which is
justly blamed. For we justly blame the fault because it mars the praiseworthy nature. As,
then, when we say that blindness is a defect of the eyes, we prove that sight belongs to the
nature of the eyes; and when we say that deafness is a defect of the ears, hearing is thereby
proved to belong to their nature;—so, when we say that it is a fault of the angelic creature
that it does not cleave to God, we hereby most plainly declare that it pertained to its nature
to cleave to God. And who can worthily conceive or express how great a glory that is, to
cleave to God, so as to live to Him, to draw wisdom from Him, to delight in Him, and to
enjoy this so great good, without death, error, or grief? And thus, since every vice is an injury
of the nature, that very vice of the wicked angels, their departure from God, is sufficient
proof that God created their nature so good, that it is an injury to it not to be with God.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—That There is No Entity526 Contrary to the Divine, Because Nonentity
Seems to Be that Which is Wholly Opposite to Him Who Supremely and Always
is.</head>
<p>This may be enough to prevent any one from supposing, when we speak of the apostate
angels, that they could have another nature, derived, as it were, from some different origin,
and not from God. From the great impiety of this error we shall disentangle ourselves the
more readily and easily, the more distinctly we understand that which God spoke by the
angel when He sent Moses to the children of Israel: “I am that I am.”527 For since God is
the supreme existence, that is to say, supremely is, and is therefore unchangeable, the things
that He made He empowered to be, but not to be supremely like Himself. To some He
communicated a more ample, to others a more limited existence, and thus arranged the
natures of beings in ranks. For as from sapere comes sapientia, so from esse comes essentia,—
a new word indeed, which the old Latin writers did not use, but which is naturalized
in our day,528 that our language may not want an equivalent for the Greek οὐσία. For this
is expressed word for word by essentia. Consequently, to that nature which supremely is,
and which created all else that exists, no nature is contrary save that which does not exist.
For nonentity is the contrary of that which is. And thus there is no being contrary to God,
the Supreme Being, and Author of all beings whatsoever.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—That the Enemies of God are So, Not by Nature, But by Will, Which,
as It Injures Them, Injures a Good Nature; For If Vice Does Not Injure, It is Not
Vice.</head>
<p>In Scripture they are called God’s enemies who oppose His rule, not by nature, but by
vice; having no power to hurt Him, but only themselves. For they are His enemies, not
through their power to hurt, but by their will to oppose Him. For God is unchangeable,
and wholly proof against injury. Therefore the vice which makes those who are called His
enemies resist Him, is an evil not to God, but to themselves. And to them it is an evil, solely
because it corrupts the good of their nature. It is not nature, therefore, but vice, which is
contrary to God. For that which is evil is contrary to the good. And who will deny that God
is the supreme good? Vice, therefore, is contrary to God, as evil to good. Further, the nature
it vitiates is a good, and therefore to this good also it is contrary. But while it is contrary to
God only as evil to good, it is contrary to the nature it vitiates, both as evil and as hurtful.
For to God no evils are hurtful; but only to natures mutable and corruptible, though, by the
testimony of the vices themselves, originally good. For were they not good, vices could not
hurt them. For how do they hurt them but by depriving them of integrity, beauty, welfare,
virtue, and, in short, whatever natural good vice is wont to diminish or destroy? But if there
be no good to take away, then no injury can be done, and consequently there can be no
vice. For it is impossible that there should be a harmless vice. Whence we gather, that
though vice cannot injure the unchangeable good, it can injure nothing but good; because
it does not exist where it does not injure. This, then, may be thus formulated: Vice cannot
be in the highest good, and cannot be but in some good. Things solely good, therefore, can
in some circumstances exist; things solely evil, never; for even those natures which are vitiated
by an evil will, so far indeed as they are vitiated, are evil, but in so far as they are natures
they are good. And when a vitiated nature is punished, besides the good it has in being a
nature, it has this also, that it is not unpunished.529 For this is just, and certainly everything
just is a good. For no one is punished for natural, but for voluntary vices. For even the vice
which by the force of habit and long continuance has become a second nature, had its origin
in the will. For at present we are speaking of the vices of the nature, which has a mental
capacity for that enlightenment which discriminates between what is just and what is unjust.</p>
<note type="footnote">529 With this may be compared the argument of Socrates in the Gorgias, in which it is shown that to escape

<head>Chapter 4.—Of the Nature of Irrational and Lifeless Creatures, Which in Their Own
Kind and Order Do Not Mar the Beauty of the Universe.</head>
<p>But it is ridiculous to condemn the faults of beasts and trees, and other such mortal and
mutable things as are void of intelligence, sensation, or life, even though these faults should
destroy their corruptible nature; for these creatures received, at their Creator’s will, an existence
fitting them, by passing away and giving place to others, to secure that lowest form of
beauty, the beauty of seasons, which in its own place is a requisite part of this world. For
things earthly were neither to be made equal to things heavenly, nor were they, though inferior,
to be quite omitted from the universe. Since, then, in those situations where such
things are appropriate, some perish to make way for others that are born in their room, and
the less succumb to the greater, and the things that are overcome are transformed into the
quality of those that have the mastery, this is the appointed order of things transitory. Of
this order the beauty does not strike us, because by our mortal frailty we are so involved in
a part of it, that we cannot perceive the whole, in which these fragments that offend us are
harmonized with the most accurate fitness and beauty. And therefore, where we are not so
well able to perceive the wisdom of the Creator, we are very properly enjoined to believe it,
lest in the vanity of human rashness we presume to find any fault with the work of so great
an Artificer. At the same time, if we attentively consider even these faults of earthly things,
which are neither voluntary nor penal, they seem to illustrate the excellence of the natures
themselves, which are all originated and created by God; for it is that which pleases us in
this nature which we are displeased to see removed by the fault,—unless even the natures
themselves displease men, as often happens when they become hurtful to them, and then
men estimate them not by their nature, but by their utility; as in the case of those animals
whose swarms scourged the pride of the Egyptians. But in this way of estimating, they may
find fault with the sun itself; for certain criminals or debtors are sentenced by the judges to
be set in the sun. Therefore it is not with respect to our convenience or discomfort, but
with respect to their own nature, that the creatures are glorifying to their Artificer. Thus
even the nature of the eternal fire, penal though it be to the condemned sinners, is most assuredly
worthy of praise. For what is more beautiful than fire flaming, blazing, and shining?
What more useful than fire for warming, restoring, cooking, though nothing is more destructive
than fire burning and consuming? The same thing, then, when applied in one
way, is destructive, but when applied suitably, is most beneficial. For who can find words
to tell its uses throughout the whole world? We must not listen, then, to those who praise
the light of fire but find fault with its heat, judging it not by its nature, but by their convenience
or discomfort. For they wish to see, but not to be burnt. But they forget that this very
light which is so pleasant to them, disagrees with and hurts weak eyes; and in that heat which
is disagreeable to them, some animals find the most suitable conditions of a healthy life.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—That in All Natures, of Every Kind and Rank, God is Glorified.</head>
<p>All natures, then, inasmuch as they are, and have therefore a rank and species of their
own, and a kind of internal harmony, are certainly good. And when they are in the places
assigned to them by the order of their nature, they preserve such being as they have received.
And those things which have not received everlasting being, are altered for better or for
worse, so as to suit the wants and motions of those things to which the Creator’s law has
made them subservient; and thus they tend in the divine providence to that end which is
embraced in the general scheme of the government of the universe. So that, though the
corruption of transitory and perishable things brings them to utter destruction, it does not
prevent their producing that which was designed to be their result. And this being so, God,
who supremely is, and who therefore created every being which has not supreme existence
(for that which was made of nothing could not be equal to Him, and indeed could not be
at all had He not made it), is not to be found fault with on account of the creature’s faults,
but is to be praised in view of the natures He has made.</p>

<pb n="529"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—What the Cause of the Blessedness of the Good Angels Is, and What
the Cause of the Misery of the Wicked.</head>
<p>Thus the true cause of the blessedness of the good angels is found to be this, that they
cleave to Him who supremely is. And if we ask the cause of the misery of the bad, it occurs
to us, and not unreasonably, that they are miserable because they have forsaken Him who
supremely is, and have turned to themselves who have no such essence. And this vice, what
else is it called than pride? For “pride is the beginning of sin.”530 They were unwilling,
then, to preserve their strength for God; and as adherence to God was the condition of their
enjoying an ampler being, they diminished it by preferring themselves to Him. This was
the first defect, and the first impoverishment, and the first flaw of their nature, which was
created, not indeed supremely existent, but finding its blessedness in the enjoyment of the
Supreme Being; whilst by abandoning Him it should become, not indeed no nature at all,
but a nature with a less ample existence, and therefore wretched.</p>
<p>If the further question be asked, What was the efficient cause of their evil will? there is
none. For what is it which makes the will bad, when it is the will itself which makes the action
bad? And consequently the bad will is the cause of the bad action, but nothing is the efficient
cause of the bad will. For if anything is the cause, this thing either has or has not a will. If
it has, the will is either good or bad. If good, who is so left to himself as to say that a good
will makes a will bad? For in this case a good will would be the cause of sin; a most absurd
supposition. On the other hand, if this hypothetical thing has a bad will, I wish to know
what made it so; and that we may not go on forever, I ask at once, what made the first evil
will bad? For that is not the first which was itself corrupted by an evil will, but that is the
first which was made evil by no other will. For if it were preceded by that which made it
evil, that will was first which made the other evil. But if it is replied, “Nothing made it evil;
it always was evil,” I ask if it has been existing in some nature. For if not, then it did not
exist at all; and if it did exist in some nature, then it vitiated and corrupted it, and injured
it, and consequently deprived it of good. And therefore the evil will could not exist in an
evil nature, but in a nature at once good and mutable, which this vice could injure. For if
it did no injury, it was no vice; and consequently the will in which it was, could not be called
evil. But if it did injury, it did it by taking away or diminishing good. And therefore there
could not be from eternity, as was suggested, an evil will in that thing in which there had
been previously a natural good, which the evil will was able to diminish by corrupting it.
If, then, it was not from eternity, who, I ask, made it? The only thing that can be suggested
in reply is, that something which itself had no will, made the will evil. I ask, then, whether
this thing was superior, inferior, or equal to it? If superior, then it is better. How, then, has
it no will, and not rather a good will? The same reasoning applies if it was equal; for so long
<note type="footnote">530 Eccles. x. 13.</note>

<pb n="530"/>
as two things have equally a good will, the one cannot produce in the other an evil will.
Then remains the supposition that that which corrupted the will of the angelic nature which
first sinned, was itself an inferior thing without a will. But that thing, be it of the lowest and
most earthly kind, is certainly itself good, since it is a nature and being, with a form and
rank of its own in its own kind and order. How, then, can a good thing be the efficient cause
of an evil will? How, I say, can good be the cause of evil? For when the will abandons what
is above itself, and turns to what is lower, it becomes evil—not because that is evil to which
it turns, but because the turning itself is wicked. Therefore it is not an inferior thing which
has made the will evil, but it is itself which has become so by wickedly and inordinately desiring
an inferior thing. For if two men, alike in physical and moral constitution, see the
same corporal beauty, and one of them is excited by the sight to desire an illicit enjoyment
while the other steadfastly maintains a modest restraint of his will, what do we suppose
brings it about, that there is an evil will in the one and not in the other? What produces it
in the man in whom it exists? Not the bodily beauty, for that was presented equally to the
gaze of both, and yet did not produce in both an evil will. Did the flesh of the one cause the
desire as he looked? But why did not the flesh of the other? Or was it the disposition? But
why not the disposition of both? For we are supposing that both were of a like temperament
of body and soul. Must we, then, say that the one was tempted by a secret suggestion of the
evil spirit? As if it was not by his own will that he consented to this suggestion and to any
inducement whatever! This consent, then, this evil will which he presented to the evil
suasive influence,—what was the cause of it, we ask? For, not to delay on such a difficulty
as this, if both are tempted equally and one yields and consents to the temptation while the
other remains unmoved by it, what other account can we give of the matter than this, that
the one is willing, the other unwilling, to fall away from chastity? And what causes this but
their own wills, in cases at least such as we are supposing, where the temperament is
identical? The same beauty was equally obvious to the eyes of both; the same secret
temptation pressed on both with equal violence. However minutely we examine the case,
therefore, we can discern nothing which caused the will of the one to be evil. For if we say
that the man himself made his will evil, what was the man himself before his will was evil
but a good nature created by God, the unchangeable good? Here are two men who, before
the temptation, were alike in body and soul, and of whom one yielded to the tempter who
persuaded him, while the other could not be persuaded to desire that lovely body which was
equally before the eyes of both. Shall we say of the successfully tempted man that he corrupted
his own will, since he was certainly good before his will became bad? Then, why did he
do so? Was it because his will was a nature, or because it was made of nothing? We shall
find that the latter is the case. For if a nature is the cause of an evil will, what else can we
say than that evil arises from good or that good is the cause of evil? And how can it come

<pb n="531"/>
to pass that a nature, good though mutable, should produce any evil—that is to say, should
make the will itself wicked?</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—That We Ought Not to Expect to Find Any Efficient Cause of the Evil
Will.</head>
<p>Let no one, therefore, look for an efficient cause of the evil will; for it is not efficient,
but deficient, as the will itself is not an effecting of something, but a defect. For defection
from that which supremely is, to that which has less of being,—this is to begin to have an
evil will. Now, to seek to discover the causes of these defections,—causes, as I have said,
not efficient, but deficient,—is as if some one sought to see darkness, or hear silence. Yet
both of these are known by us, and the former by means only of the eye, the latter only by
the ear; but not by their positive actuality,531 but by their want of it. Let no one, then seek
to know from me what I know that I do not know; unless he perhaps wishes to learn to be
ignorant of that of which all we know is, that it cannot be known. For those things which
are known not by their actuality, but by their want of it, are known, if our expression may
be allowed and understood, by not knowing them, that by knowing them they may be not
known. For when the eyesight surveys objects that strike the sense, it nowhere sees darkness
but where it begins not to see. And so no other sense but the ear can perceive silence, and
yet it is only perceived by not hearing. Thus, too, our mind perceives intelligible forms by
understanding them; but when they are deficient, it knows them by not knowing them; for
“who can understand defects?”532</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Of the Misdirected Love Whereby the Will Fell Away from the Immutable
to the Mutable Good.</head>
<p>This I do know, that the nature of God can never, nowhere, nowise be defective, and
that natures made of nothing can. These latter, however, the more being they have, and the
more good they do (for then they do something positive), the more they have efficient causes;
but in so far as they are defective in being, and consequently do evil (for then what is their
work but vanity?), they have deficient causes. And I know likewise, that the will could not
become evil, were it unwilling to become so; and therefore its failings are justly punished,
being not necessary, but voluntary. For its defections are not to evil things, but are themselves
evil; that is to say, are not towards things that are naturally and in themselves evil, but the
defection of the will is evil, because it is contrary to the order of nature, and an abandonment
of that which has supreme being for that which has less. For avarice is not a fault inherent
in gold, but in the man who inordinately loves gold, to the detriment of justice, which ought
to be held in incomparably higher regard than gold. Neither is luxury the fault of lovely
and charming objects, but of the heart that inordinately loves sensual pleasures, to the neglect
of temperance, which attaches us to objects more lovely in their spirituality, and more delectable
by their incorruptibility. Nor yet is boasting the fault of human praise, but of the
soul that is inordinately fond of the applause of men, and that makes light of the voice of
conscience. Pride, too, is not the fault of him who delegates power, nor of power itself, but
of the soul that is inordinately enamored of its own power, and despises the more just
dominion of a higher authority. Consequently he who inordinately loves the good which
any nature possesses, even though he obtain it, himself becomes evil in the good, and
wretched because deprived of a greater good.</p>

<pb n="534"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—Whether the Angels, Besides Receiving from God Their Nature, Received
from Him Also Their Good Will by the Holy Spirit Imbuing Them with Love.</head>
<p>There is, then, no natural efficient cause or, if I may be allowed the expression, no essential
cause, of the evil will, since itself is the origin of evil in mutable spirits, by which the
good of their nature is diminished and corrupted; and the will is made evil by nothing else
than defection from God,—a defection of which the cause, too, is certainly deficient. But
as to the good will, if we should say that there is no efficient cause of it, we must beware of
giving currency to the opinion that the good will of the good angels is not created, but is
co-eternal with God. For if they themselves are created, how can we say that their good will
was eternal? But if created, was it created along with themselves, or did they exist for a time
without it? If along with themselves, then doubtless it was created by Him who created
them, and, as soon as ever they were created, they attached themselves to Him who created
them, with the love He created in them. And they are separated from the society of the rest,
because they have continued in the same good will; while the others have fallen away to
another will, which is an evil one, by the very fact of its being a falling away from the good;
from which, we may add, they would not have fallen away had they been unwilling to do
so. But if the good angels existed for a time without a good will, and produced it in themselves
without God’s interference, then it follows that they made themselves better than He
made them. Away with such a thought! For without a good will, what were they but evil?
Or if they were not evil, because they had not an evil will any more than a good one (for
they had not fallen away from that which as yet they had not begun to enjoy), certainly they
were not the same, not so good, as when they came to have a good will. Or if they could
not make themselves better than they were made by Him who is surpassed by none in His
work, then certainly, without His helpful operation, they could not come to possess that
good will which made them better. And though their good will effected that they did not
turn to themselves, who had a more stinted existence, but to Him who supremely is, and
that, being united to Him, their own being was enlarged, and they lived a wise and blessed
life by His communications to them, what does this prove but that the will, however good
it might be, would have continued helplessly only to desire Him, had not He who had made
their nature out of nothing, and yet capable of enjoying Him, first stimulated it to desire
Him, and then filled it with Himself, and so made it better?</p>
<p>Besides, this too has to be inquired into, whether, if the good angels made their own
will good, they did so with or without will? If without, then it was not their doing. If with,
was the will good or bad? If bad, how could a bad will give birth to a good one? If good,
then already they had a good will. And who made this will, which already they had, but He
who created them with a good will, or with that chaste love by which they cleaved to Him,
in one and the same act creating their nature, and endowing it with grace? And thus we are
driven to believe that the holy angels never existed without a good will or the love of God.

<pb n="535"/>
But the angels who, though created good, are yet evil now, became so by their own will.
And this will was not made evil by their good nature, unless by its voluntary defection from
good; for good is not the cause of evil, but a defection from good is. These angels, therefore,
either received less of the grace of the divine love than those who persevered in the same;
or if both were created equally good, then, while the one fell by their evil will, the others
were more abundantly assisted, and attained to that pitch of blessedness at which they became
certain they should never fall from it,—as we have already shown in the preceding book.533
We must therefore acknowledge, with the praise due to the Creator, that not only of holy
men, but also of the holy angels, it can be said that “the love of God is shed abroad in their
hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto them.”534 And that not only of men, but
primarily and principally of angels it is true, as it is written, “It is good to draw near to
God.”535 And those who have this good in common, have, both with Him to whom they
draw near, and with one another, a holy fellowship, and form one city of God—His living
sacrifice, and His living temple. And I see that, as I have now spoken of the rise of this city
among the angels, it is time to speak of the origin of that part of it which is hereafter to be
united to the immortal angels, and which at present is being gathered from among mortal
men, and is either sojourning on earth, or, in the persons of those who have passed through
death, is resting in the secret receptacles and abodes of disembodied spirits. For from one
man, whom God created as the first, the whole human race descended, according to the
faith of Holy Scripture, which deservedly is of wonderful authority among all nations
throughout the world; since, among its other true statements, it predicted, by its divine
foresight, that all nations would give credit to it.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years
to the World’s Past.</head>
<p>Let us, then, omit the conjectures of men who know not what they say, when they speak
of the nature and origin of the human race. For some hold the same opinion regarding men
that they hold regarding the world itself, that they have always been. Thus Apuleius says
when he is describing our race, “Individually they are mortal, but collectively, and as a race,
they are immortal.”536 And when they are asked, how, if the human race has always been,
they vindicate the truth of their history, which narrates who were the inventors, and what
they invented, and who first instituted the liberal studies and the other arts, and who first
inhabited this or that region, and this or that island? they reply,537 that most, if not all lands,
were so desolated at intervals by fire and flood, that men were greatly reduced in numbers,
and from these, again, the population was restored to its former numbers, and that thus
there was at intervals a new beginning made, and though those things which had been interrupted
and checked by the severe devastations were only renewed, yet they seemed to be
originated then; but that man could not exist at all save as produced by man. But they say
what they think, not what they know.</p>
<p>They are deceived, too, by those highly mendacious documents which profess to give
the history of many thousand years, though, reckoning by the sacred writings, we find that
not 6000 years have yet passed.538 And, not to spend many words in exposing the baselessness
of these documents, in which so many thousands of years are accounted for, nor in
proving that their authorities are totally inadequate, let me cite only that letter which Alexander
the Great wrote to his mother Olympias,539 giving her the narrative he had from an
Egyptian priest, which he had extracted from their sacred archives, and which gave an account
of kingdoms mentioned also by the Greek historians. In this letter of Alexander’s a term
of upwards of 5000 years is assigned to the kingdom of Assyria; while in the Greek history
only 1300 years are reckoned from the reign of Bel himself, whom both Greek and Egyptian
agree in counting the first king of Assyria. Then to the empire of the Persians and Macedonians
this Egyptian assigned more than 8000 years, counting to the time of Alexander, to
whom he was speaking; while among the Greeks, 485 years are assigned to the Macedonians
down to the death of Alexander, and to the Persians 233 years, reckoning to the termination
of his conquests. Thus these give a much smaller number of years than the Egyptians; and
<note type="footnote">536 De Deo Socrates.</note>
<note type="footnote">537 Augustin no doubt refers to the interesting account given by Critias, near the beginning of the Timæus,
of the conversation of Solon with the Egyptian priests.</note>
<note type="footnote">538 Augustin here follows the chronology of Eusebius, who reckons 5611 years from the Creation to the
taking of Rome by the Goths; adopting the Septuagint version of the Patriarchal ages.</note>
<note type="footnote">539 See above, viii. 5.</note>

<pb n="537"/>
indeed, though multiplied three times, the Greek chronology would still be shorter. For the
Egyptians are said to have formerly reckoned only four months to their year;540 so that one
year, according to the fuller and truer computation now in use among them as well as among
ourselves, would comprehend three of their old years. But not even thus, as I said, does the
Greek history correspond with the Egyptian in its chronology. And therefore the former
must receive the greater credit, because it does not exceed the true account of the duration
of the world as it is given by our documents, which are truly sacred. Further, if this letter
of Alexander, which has become so famous, differs widely in this matter of chronology from
the probable credible account, how much less can we believe these documents which, though
full of fabu lous and fictitious antiquities, they would fain oppose to the authority of our
well-known and divine books, which predicted that the whole world would believe them,
and which the whole world accordingly has believed; which proved, too, that it had truly
narrated past events by its prediction of future events, which have so exactly come to pass!</p>
<note type="footnote">540 It is not apparent to what Augustin refers. The Arcadians, according to Macrobius (Saturn. i. 7), divided
their year into three months, and the Egyptians divided theirs into three seasons: each of these seasons having
four months, it is possible that Augustin may have referred to this. See Wilkinson’s excursus on the Egyptian
year, in Rawlinson’s Herod. Book ii.</note>

<head>Chapter 12.—How These Persons are to Be Answered, Who Find Fault with the
Creation of Man on the Score of Its Recent Date.</head>
<p>As to those who are always asking why man was not created during these countless ages
of the infinitely extended past, and came into being so lately that, according to Scripture,
less than 6000 years have elapsed since He began to be, I would reply to them regarding the
creation of man, just as I replied regarding the origin of the world to those who will not
believe that it is not eternal, but had a beginning, which even Plato himself most plainly
declares, though some think his statement was not consistent with his real opinion.542 If
it offends them that the time that has elapsed since the creation of man is so short, and his
years so few according to our authorities, let them take this into consideration, that nothing
that has a limit is long, and that all the ages of time being finite, are very little, or indeed
nothing at all, when compared to the interminable eternity. Consequently, if there had
elapsed since the creation of man, I do not say five or six, but even sixty or six hundred
thousand years, or sixty times as many, or six hundred or six hundred thousand times as
many, or this sum multiplied until it could no longer be expressed in numbers, the same
question could still be put, Why was he not made before? For the past and boundless
eternity during which God abstained from creating man is so great, that, compare it with
what vast and untold number of ages you please, so long as there is a definite conclusion of
this term of time, it is not even as if you compared the minutest drop of water with the ocean
that everywhere flows around the globe. For of these two, one indeed is very small, the
other incomparably vast, yet both are finite; but that space of time which starts from some
beginning, and is limited by some termination, be it of what extent it may, if you compare
it with that which has no beginning, I know not whether to say we should count it the very
minutest thing, or nothing at all. For, take this limited time, and deduct from the end of it,
one by one, the briefest moments (as you might take day by day from a man’s life, beginning
at the day in which he now lives, back to that of his birth), and though the number of moments
you must subtract in this backward movement be so great that no word can express
it, yet this subtraction will sometime carry you to the beginning. But if you take away from
a time which has no beginning, I do not say brief moments one by one, nor yet hours, or
days, or months, or years even in quantities, but terms of years so vast that they cannot be
named by the most skillful arithmeticians,—take away terms of years as vast as that which
we have supposed to be gradually consumed by the deduction of moments,—and take them
away not once and again repeatedly, but always, and what do you effect, what do you make
by your deduction, since you never reach the beginning, which has no existence? Wherefore,
that which we now demand after five thousand odd years, our descendants might with like

curiosity demand after six hundred thousand years, supposing these dying generations of
men continue so long to decay and be renewed, and supposing posterity continues as weak
and ignorant as ourselves. The same question might have been asked by those who have
lived before us and while man was even newer upon earth. The first man himself in short
might the day after or the very day of his creation have asked why he was created no sooner.
And no matter at what earlier or later period he had been created, this controversy about
the commencement of this world’s history would have had precisely the same difficulties
as it has now.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Of the Revolution of the Ages, Which Some Philosophers Believe Will
Bring All Things Round Again, After a Certain Fixed Cycle, to the Same Order
and Form as at First.</head>
<p>This controversy some philosophers have seen no other approved means of solving
than by introducing cycles of time, in which there should be a constant renewal and repetition
of the order of nature;543 and they have therefore asserted that these cycles will ceaselessly
recur, one passing away and another coming, though they are not agreed as to whether one
permanent world shall pass through all these cycles, or whether the world shall at fixed intervals
die out, and be renewed so as to exhibit a recurrence of the same phenomena—the
things which have been, and those which are to be, coinciding. And from this fantastic vicissitude
they exempt not even the immortal soul that has attained wisdom, consigning it
to a ceaseless transmigration between delusive blessedness and real misery. For how can
that be truly called blessed which has no assurance of being so eternally, and is either in ignorance
of the truth, and blind to the misery that is approaching, or, knowing it, is in misery
and fear? Or if it passes to bliss, and leaves miseries forever, then there happens in time a
new thing which time shall not end. Why not, then, the world also? Why may not man,
too, be a similar thing? So that, by following the straight path of sound doctrine, we escape,
I know not what circuitous paths, discovered by deceiving and deceived sages.</p>
<p>Some, too, in advocating these recurring cycles that restore all things to their original
cite in favor of their supposition what Solomon says in the book of Ecclesiastes: “What is
that which hath been? It is that which shall be. And what is that which is done? It is that
which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Who can speak and say, See,
this is new? It hath been already of old time, which was before us.”544 This he said either
of those things of which he had just been speaking—the succession of generations, the orbit
of the sun, the course of rivers,—or else of all kinds of creatures that are born and die. For
men were before us, are with us, and shall be after us; and so all living things and all plants.
Even monstrous and irregular productions, though differing from one another, and though
some are reported as solitary instances, yet resemble one another generally, in so far as they
are miraculous and monstrous, and, in this sense, have been, and shall be, and are no new
and recent things under the sun. However, some would understand these words as meaning
that in the predestination of God all things have already existed, and that thus there is no
new thing under the sun. At all events, far be it from any true believer to suppose that by
these words of Solomon those cycles are meant, in which, according to those philosophers,
the same periods and events of time are repeated; as if, for example, the philosopher Plato,
<note type="footnote">543 Antoninus says (ii. 14): “All things from eternity are of like forms, and come round in a circle.” Cf. also
ix. 28, and the references to more ancient philosophical writers in Gataker’s notes in these passages.</note>
<note type="footnote">544 Eccles. i. 9, 10. So Origen, de Prin. iii. 5, and ii. 3.</note>

<pb n="542"/>
having taught in the school at Athens which is called the Academy, so, numberless ages
before, at long but certain intervals, this same Plato and the same school, and the same disciples
existed, and so also are to be repeated during the countless cycles that are yet to be,—far
be it, I say, from us to believe this. For once Christ died for our sins; and, rising from the
dead, He dieth no more. “Death hath no more dominion over Him;545 and we ourselves
after the resurrection shall be “ever with the Lord,”546 to whom we now say, as the sacred
Psalmist dictates, “Thou shall keep us, O Lord, Thou shall preserve us from this generation.”
547 And that too which follows, is, I think, appropriate enough: “The wicked walk in
a circle,” not because their life is to recur by means of these circles, which these philosophers
imagine, but because the path in which their false doctrine now runs is circuitous.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Creation of the Human Race in Time, and How This Was Effected
Without Any New Design or Change of Purpose on God’s Part.</head>
<p>What wonder is it if, entangled in these circles, they find neither entrance nor egress?
For they know not how the human race, and this mortal condition of ours, took its origin,
nor how it will be brought to an end, since they cannot penetrate the inscrutable wisdom
of God. For, though Himself eternal, and without beginning, yet He caused time to have
a beginning; and man, whom He had not previously made He made in time, not from a new
and sudden resolution, but by His unchangeable and eternal design. Who can search out
the unsearchable depth of this purpose, who can scrutinize the inscrutable wisdom, wherewith
God, without change of will, created man, who had never before been, and gave him an existence
in time, and increased the human race from one individual? For the Psalmist himself,
when he had first said, “Thou shalt keep us, O Lord, Thou shall preserve us from this generation
for ever,” and had then rebuked those whose foolish and impious doctrine preserves
for the soul no eternal deliverance and blessedness adds immediately, “The wicked walk in
a circle.” Then, as if it were said to him, “What then do you believe, feel, know? Are we to
believe that it suddenly occurred to God to create man, whom He had never before made
in a past eternity,—God, to whom nothing new can occur, and in whom is no changeableness?”
the Psalmist goes on to reply, as if addressing God Himself, “According to the depth
of Thy wisdom Thou hast multiplied the children of men.” Let men, he seems to say, fancy
what they please, let them conjecture and dispute as seems good to them, but Thou hast
multiplied the children of men according to the depth of thy wisdom, which no man can
comprehend. For this is a depth indeed, that God always has been, and that man, whom
He had never made before, He willed to make in time, and this without changing His design
and will.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Whether We are to Believe that God, as He Has Always Been Sovereign
Lord, Has Always Had Creatures Over Whom He Exercised His Sovereignty;
And in What Sense We Can Say that the Creature Has Always Been, and Yet
Cannot Say It is Co-Eternal.</head>
<p>For my own part, indeed, as I dare not say that there ever was a time when the Lord
God was not Lord,548 so I ought not to doubt that man had no existence before time, and
was first created in time. But when I consider what God could be the Lord of, if there was
not always some creature, I shrink from making any assertion, remembering my own insignificance,
and that it is written, “What man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who
can think what the will of the Lord is? For the thoughts of mortal men are timid, and our
devices are but uncertain. For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly
tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.”549 Many things certainly
do I muse upon in this earthly tabernacle, because the one thing which is true among
the many, or beyond the many, I cannot find. If, then, among these many thoughts, I say
that there have always been creatures for Him to be Lord of, who is always and ever has
been Lord, but that these creatures have not always been the same, but succeeded one another
(for we would not seem to say that any is co-eternal with the Creator, an assertion condemned
equally by faith and sound reason), I must take care lest I fall into the absurd and ignorant
error of maintaining that by these successions and changes mortal creatures have always
existed, whereas the immortal creatures had not begun to exist until the date of our own
world, when the angels were created; if at least the angels are intended by that light which
was first made, or, rather, by that heaven of which it is said, “In the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth.”550 The angels, at least did not exist before they were created;
for if we say that they have always existed, we shall seem to make them co-eternal with the
Creator. Again, if I say that the angels were not created in time, but existed before all times,
as those over whom God, who has ever been Sovereign, exercised His sovereignty, then I
shall be asked whether, if they were created before all time, they, being creatures, could
possibly always exist. It may perhaps be replied, Why not always, since that which is in all
time may very properly be said to be “always?” Now so true is it that these angels have existed
in all time that even before time was they were created; if at least time began with the heavens,
and the angels existed before the heavens. And if time was even before the heavenly bodies,
not indeed marked by hours, days, months, and years,—for these measures of time’s periods
which are commonly and properly called times, did manifestly begin with the motion of
<note type="footnote">548 Cf. de Trin. v. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">549 Wisdom ix. 13–15.</note>

<pb n="545"/>
the heavenly bodies, and so God said, when He appointed them, “Let them be for signs, and
for seasons, and for days, and for years,”551—if, I say, time was before these heavenly bodies
by some changing movement, whose parts succeeded one another and could not exist simultaneously,
and if there was some such movement among the angels which necessitated
the existence of time, and that they from their very creation should be subject to these
temporal changes, then they have existed in all time, for time came into being along with
them. And who will say that what was in all time, was not always?</p>
<p>But if I make such a reply, it will be said to me, How, then, are they not co-eternal with
the Creator, if He and they always have been? How even can they be said to have been created,
if we are to understand that they have always existed? What shall we reply to this?
Shall we say that both statements are true? that they always have been, since they have been
in all time, they being created along with time, or time along with them, and yet that also
they were created? For, similarly, we will not deny that time itself was created, though no
one doubts that time has been in all time; for if it has not been in all time, then there was a
time when there was no time. But the most foolish person could not make such an assertion.
For we can reasonably say there was a time when Rome was not; there was a time when
Jerusalem was not; there was a time when Abraham was not; there was a time when man
was not, and so on: in fine, if the world was not made at the commencement of time, but
after some time had elapsed, we can say there was a time when the world was not. But to
say there was a time when time was not, is as absurd as to say there was a man when there
was no man; or, this world was when this world was not. For if we are not referring to the
same object, the form of expression may be used, as, there was another man when this man
was not. Thus we can reasonably say there was another time when this time was not; but
not the merest simpleton could say there was a time when there was no time. As, then, we
say that time was created, though we also say that it always has been, since in all time time
has been, so it does not follow that if the angels have always been, they were therefore not
created. For we say that they have always been, because they have been in all time; and we
say they have been in all time, because time itself could no wise be without them. For where
there is no creature whose changing movements admit of succession, there cannot be time
at all. And consequently, even if they have always existed, they were created; neither, if they
have always existed, are they therefore co-eternal with the Creator. For He has always existed
in unchangeable eternity; while they were created, and are said to have been always, because
they have been in all time, time being impossible without the creature. But time passing
away by its changefulness, cannot be co-eternal with changeless eternity. And consequently,
though the immortality of the angels does not pass in time, does not become past as if now
it were not, nor has a future as if it were not yet, still their movements, which are the basis
<note type="footnote">551 Gen. i. 14.</note>

<pb n="546"/>
of time, do pass from future to past; and therefore they cannot be co-eternal with the Creator,
in whose movement we cannot say that there has been that which now is not, or shall be
that which is not yet. Wherefore, if God always has been Lord, He has always had creatures
under His dominion,—creatures, however, not begotten of Him, but created by Him out of
nothing; nor co-eternal with Him, for He was before them though at no time without them,
because He preceded them, not by the lapse of time, but by His abiding eternity. But if I
make this reply to those who demand how He was always Creator, always Lord, if there
were not always a subject creation; or how this was created, and not rather co-eternal with
its Creator, if it always was, I fear I may be accused of recklessly affirming what I know not,
instead of teaching what I know. I return, therefore, to that which our Creator has seen fit
that we should know; and those things which He has allowed the abler men to know in this
life, or has reserved to be known in the next by the perfected saints, I acknowledge to be
beyond my capacity. But I have thought it right to discuss these matters without making
positive assertions, that they who read may be warned to abstain from hazardous questions,
and may not deem themselves fit for everything. Let them rather endeavor to obey the
wholesome injunction of the apostle, when he says, “For I say, through the grace given unto
me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of
faith.”552 For if an infant receive nourishment suited to its strength, it becomes capable, as
it grows, of taking more; but if its strength and capacity be overtaxed, it dwines away in
place of growing.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—How We are to Understand God’s Promise of Life Eternal, Which
Was Uttered Before the “Eternal Times.”</head>
<p>I own that I do not know what ages passed before the human race was created, yet I
have no doubt that no created thing is co-eternal with the Creator. But even the apostle
speaks of time as eternal, and this with reference, not to the future, but, which is more surprising,
to the past. For he says, “In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised
before the eternal times, but hath in due times manifested His word.”553 You see he says
that in the past there have been eternal times, which, however, were not co-eternal with
God. And since God before these eternal times not only existed, but also, “promised” life
eternal, which He manifested in its own times (that is to say, in due times), what else is this
than His word? For this is life eternal. But then, how did He promise; for the promise was
made to men, and yet they had no existence before eternal times? Does this not mean that,
in His own eternity, and in His co-eternal word, that which was to be in its own time was
already predestined and fixed?</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—What Defence is Made by Sound Faith Regarding God’s Unchangeable
Counsel and Will, Against the Reasonings of Those Who Hold that the Works
of God are Eternally Repeated in Revolving Cycles that Restore All Things as
They Were.</head>
<p>Of this, too, I have no doubt, that before the first man was created, there never had been
a man at all, neither this same man himself recurring by I know not what cycles, and having
made I know not how many revolutions, nor any other of similar nature. From this belief
I am not frightened by philosophical arguments, among which that is reckoned the most
acute which is founded on the assertion that the infinite cannot be comprehended by any
mode of knowledge. Consequently, they argue, God has in his own mind finite conceptions
of all finite things which He makes. Now it cannot be supposed that His goodness was ever
idle; for if it were, there should be ascribed to Him an awakening to activity in time, from
a past eternity of inactivity, as if He repented of an idleness that had no beginning, and
proceeded, therefore, to make a beginning of work. This being the case, they say it must be
that the same things are always repeated, and that as they pass, so they are destined always
to return, whether amidst all these changes the world remains the same,—the world which
has always been, and yet was created,—or that the world in these revolutions is perpetually
dying out and being renewed; otherwise, if we point to a time when the works of God were
begun, it would be believed that He considered His past eternal leisure to be inert and indolent,
and therefore condemned and altered it as displeasing to Himself. Now if God is supposed
to have been indeed always making temporal things, but different from one another,
and one after the other, so, that He thus came at last to make man, whom He had never
made before, then it may seem that He made man not with knowledge (for they suppose
no knowledge can comprehend the infinite succession of creatures), but at the dictate of
the hour, as it struck him at the moment, with a sudden and accidental change of mind.
On the other hand, say they, if those cycles be admitted, and if we suppose that the same
temporal things are repeated, while the world either remains identical through all these rotations,
or else dies away and is renewed, then there is ascribed to God neither the slothful
ease of a past eternity, nor a rash and unforeseen creation. And if the same things be not
thus repeated in cycles, then they cannot by any science or prescience be comprehended in
their endless diversity. Even though reason could not refute, faith would smile at these argumentations,
with which the godless endeavor to turn our simple piety from the right way,
that we may walk with them “in a circle.” But by the help of the Lord our God, even reason,
and that readily enough, shatters these revolving circles which conjecture frames. For that
which specially leads these men astray to refer their own circles to the straight path of truth,
is, that they measure by their own human, changeable, and narrow intellect the divine mind,
which is absolutely unchangeable, infinitely capacious, and without succession of thought,

<pb n="549"/>
counting all things without number. So that saying of the apostle comes true of them, for,
“comparing themselves with themselves, they do not understand.”554 For because they do,
in virtue of a new purpose, whatever new thing has occurred to them to be done (their minds
being changeable), they conclude it is so with God; and thus compare, not God,—for they
cannot conceive God, but think of one like themselves when they think of Him,—not God,
but themselves, and not with Him, but with themselves. For our part, we dare not believe
that God is affected in one way when He works, in another when He rests. Indeed, to say
that He is affected at all, is an abuse of language, since it implies that there comes to be
something in His nature which was not there before. For he who is affected is acted upon,
and whatever is acted upon is changeable. His leisure, therefore, is no laziness, indolence,
inactivity; as in His work is no labor, effort, industry. He can act while He reposes, and
repose while He acts. He can begin a new work with (not a new, but) an eternal design; and
what He has not made before, He does not now begin to make because He repents of His
former repose. But when one speaks of His former repose and subsequent operation (and
I know not how men can understand these things), this “former” and “subsequent” are applied
only to the things created, which formerly did not exist, and subsequently came into
existence. But in God the former purpose is not altered and obliterated by the subsequent
and different purpose, but by one and the same eternal and unchangeable will He effected
regarding the things He created, both that formerly, so long as they were not, they should
not be, and that subsequently, when they began to be, they should come into existence.
And thus, perhaps, He would show, in a very striking way, to those who have eyes for such
things, how independent He is of what He makes, and how it is of His own gratuitous
goodness He creates, since from eternity He dwelt without creatures in no less perfect a
blessedness.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—Against Those Who Assert that Things that are Infinite555 Cannot Be
Comprehended by the Knowledge of God.</head>
<p>As for their other assertion, that God’s knowledge cannot comprehend things infinite,
it only remains for them to affirm, in order that they may sound the depths of their impiety,
that God does not know all numbers. For it is very certain that they are infinite; since, no
matter of what number you suppose an end to be made, this number can be, I will not say,
increased by the addition of one more, but however great it be, and however vast be the
multitude of which it is the rational and scientific expression, it can still be not only doubled,
but even multiplied. Moreover, each number is so defined by its own properties, that no
two numbers are equal. They are therefore both unequal and different from one another;
and while they are simply finite, collectively they are infinite. Does God, therefore, not
know numbers on account of this infinity; and does His knowledge extend only to a certain
height in numbers, while of the rest He is ignorant? Who is so left to himself as to say so?
Yet they can hardly pretend to put numbers out of the question, or maintain that they have
nothing to do with the knowledge of God; for Plato,556 their great authority, represents God
as framing the world on numerical principles: and in our books also it is said to God, “Thou
hast ordered all things in number, and measure, and weight.”557 The prophet also says,”
Who bringeth out their host by number.”558 And the Saviour says in the Gospel, “The very
hairs of your head are all numbered.”559 Far be it, then, from us to doubt that all number
is known to Him “whose understanding,” according to the Psalmist, “is infinite.”560 The
infinity of number, though there be no numbering of infinite numbers, is yet not incomprehensible
by Him whose understanding is infinite. And thus, if everything which is comprehended
is defined or made finite by the comprehension of him who knows it, then all infinity
is in some ineffable way made finite to God, for it is comprehensible by His knowledge.
Wherefore, if the infinity of numbers cannot be infinite to the knowledge of God, by which
it is comprehended, what are we poor creatures that we should presume to fix limits to His
knowledge, and say that unless the same temporal thing be repeated by the same periodic
revolutions, God cannot either foreknow His creatures that He may make them, or know
them when He has made them? God, whose knowledge is simply manifold, and uniform
in its variety, comprehends all incomprehensibles with so incomprehensible a comprehension,
that though He willed always to make His later works novel and unlike what went before

<head>Chapter 19.—Of Worlds Without End, or Ages of Ages.561</head>
<p>I do not presume to determine whether God does so, and whether these times which
are called “ages of ages” are joined together in a continuous series, and succeed one another
with a regulated diversity, and leave exempt from their vicissitudes only those who are freed
from their misery, and abide without end in a blessed immortality; or whether these are
called “ages of ages,” that we may understand that the ages remain unchangeable in God’s
unwavering wisdom, and are the efficient causes, as it were, of those ages which are being
spent in time. Possibly “ages” is used for “age,” so that nothing else is meant by “ages of
ages” than by “age of age,” as nothing else is meant by “heavens of heavens” than by “heaven
of heaven.” For God called the firmament, above which are the waters, “Heaven,” and yet
the psalm says, “Let the waters that are above the heavens praise the name of the Lord.”562
Which of these two meanings we are to attach to “ages of ages,” or whether there is not some
other and better meaning still, is a very profound question; and the subject we are at present
handling presents no obstacle to our meanwhile deferring the discussion of it, whether we
may be able to determine anything about it, or may only be made more cautious by its further
treatment, so as to be deterred from making any rash affirmations in a matter of such obscurity.
For at present we are disputing the opinion that affirms the existence of those
periodic revolutions by which the same things are always recurring at intervals of time.
Now whichever of these suppositions regarding the “ages of ages” be the true one, it avails
nothing for the substantiating of those cycles; for whether the ages of ages be not a repetition
of the same world, but different worlds succeeding one another in a regulated connection,
the ransomed souls abiding in well-assured bliss without any recurrence of misery, or
whether the ages of ages be the eternal causes which rule what shall be and is in time, it
equally follows, that those cycles which bring round the same things have no existence; and
nothing more thoroughly explodes them than the fact of the eternal life of the saints.</p>

and Perfect Blessedness, Must Yet Again and Again in These Periodic Revolutions
Return to Labor and Misery.</head>
<p>What pious ears could bear to hear that after a life spent in so many and severe distresses
(if, indeed, that should be called a life at all which is rather a death, so utter that the love of
this present death makes us fear that death which delivers us from it,) that after evils so
disastrous, and miseries of all kinds have at length been expiated and finished by the help
of true religion and wisdom, and when we have thus attained to the vision of God, and have
entered into bliss by the contemplation of spiritual light and participation in His unchangeable
immortality, which we burn to attain,—that we must at some time lose all this, and that
they who do lose it are cast down from that eternity, truth, and felicity to infernal mortality
and shameful foolishness, and are involved in accursed woes, in which God is lost, truth
held in detestation, and happiness sought in iniquitous impurities? and that this will happen
endlessly again and again, recurring at fixed intervals, and in regularly returning periods?
and that this everlasting and ceaseless revolution of definite cycles, which remove and restore
true misery and deceitful bliss in turn, is contrived in order that God may be able to know
His own works, since on the one hand He cannot rest from creating and on the other, cannot
know the infinite number of His creatures, if He always makes creatures? Who, I say, can
listen to such things? Who can accept or suffer them to be spoken? Were they true, it were
not only more prudent to keep silence regarding them, but even (to express myself as best
I can) it were the part of wisdom not to know them. For if in the future world we shall not
remember these things, and by this oblivion be blessed, why should we now increase our
misery, already burdensome enough, by the knowledge of them? If, on the other hand, the
knowledge of them will be forced upon us hereafter, now at least let us remain in ignorance,
that in the present expectation we may enjoy a blessedness which the future reality is not
to bestow; since in this life we are expecting to obtain life everlasting, but in the world to
come are to discover it to be blessed, but not everlasting.</p>
<p>And if they maintain that no one can attain to the blessedness of the world to come,
unless in this life he has been indoctrinated in those cycles in which bliss and misery relieve
one another, how do they avow that the more a man loves God, the more readily he attains
to blessedness,—they who teach what paralyzes love itself? For who would not be more remiss
and lukewarm in his love for a person whom he thinks he shall be forced to abandon,
and whose truth and wisdom he shall come to hate; and this, too, after he has quite attained
to the utmost and most blissful knowledge of Him that he is capable of? Can any one be
faithful in his love, even to a human friend, if he knows that he is destined to become his

<pb n="554"/>
enemy?563 God forbid that there be any truth in an opinion which threatens us with a real
misery that is never to end, but is often and endlessly to be interrupted by intervals of fallacious
happiness. For what happiness can be more fallacious and false than that in whose
blaze of truth we yet remain ignorant that we shall be miserable, or in whose most secure
citadel we yet fear that we shall be so? For if, on the one hand, we are to be ignorant of
coming calamity, then our present misery is not so short-sighted for it is assured of coming
bliss. If, on the other hand, the disaster that threatens is not concealed from us in the world
to come, then the time of misery which is to be at last exchanged for a state of blessedness,
is spent by the soul more happily than its time of happiness, which is to end in a return to
misery. And thus our expectation of unhappiness is happy, but of happiness unhappy. And
therefore, as we here suffer present ills, and hereafter fear ills that are imminent, it were
truer to say that we shall always be miserable than that we can some time be happy.</p>
<p>But these things are declared to be false by the loud testimony of religion and truth; for
religion truthfully promises a true blessedness, of which we shall be eternally assured, and
which cannot be interrupted by any disaster. Let us therefore keep to the straight path,
which is Christ, and, with Him as our Guide and Saviour, let us turn away in heart and mind
from the unreal and futile cycles of the godless. Porphyry, Platonist though he was, abjured
the opinion of his school, that in these cycles souls are ceaselessly passing away and returning,
either being struck with the extravagance of the idea, or sobered by his knowledge of
Christianity. As I mentioned in the tenth book,564 he preferred saying that the soul, as it
had been sent into the world that it might know evil, and be purged and delivered from it,
was never again exposed to such an experience after it had once returned to the Father.
And if he abjured the tenets of his school, how much more ought we Christians to abominate
and avoid an opinion so unfounded and hostile to our faith? But having disposed of these
cycles and escaped out of them, no necessity compels us to suppose that the human race
had no beginning in time, on the ground that there is nothing new in nature which, by I
know not what cycles, has not at some previous period existed, and is not hereafter to exist
again. For if the soul, once delivered, as it never was before, is never to return to misery,
then there happens in its experience something which never happened before; and this, indeed,
something of the greatest consequence, to wit, the secure entrance into eternal felicity.
And if in an immortal nature there can occur a novelty, which never has been, nor ever shall
be, reproduced by any cycle, why is it disputed that the same may occur in mortal natures?
If they maintain that blessedness is no new experience to the soul, but only a return to that

state in which it has been eternally, then at least its deliverance from misery is something
new, since, by their own showing, the misery from which it is delivered is itself, too, a new
experience. And if this new experience fell out by accident, and was not embraced in the
order of things appointed by Divine Providence, then where are those determinate and
measured cycles in which no new thing happens, but all things are reproduced as they were
before? If, however, this new experience was embraced in that providential order of nature
(whether the soul was exposed to the evil of this world for the sake of discipline, or fell into
it by sin), then it is possible for new things to happen which never happened before, and
which yet are not extraneous to the order of nature. And if the soul is able by its own imprudence
to create for itself a new misery, which was not unforeseen by the Divine Providence,
but was provided for in the order of nature along with the deliverance from it, how
can we, even with all the rashness of human vanity, presume to deny that God can create
new things—new to the world, but not to Him—which He never before created, but yet
foresaw from all eternity? If they say that it is indeed true that ransomed souls return no
more to misery, but that even so no new thing happens, since there always have been, now
are, and ever shall be a succession of ransomed souls, they must at least grant that in this
case there are new souls to whom the misery and the deliverance from it are new. For if
they maintain that those souls out of which new men are daily being made (from whose
bodies, if they have lived wisely, they are so delivered that they never return to misery) are
not new, but have existed from eternity, they must logically admit that they are infinite.
For however great a finite number of souls there were, that would not have sufficed to make
perpetually new men from eternity,—men whose souls were to be eternally freed from this
mortal state, and never afterwards to return to it. And our philosophers will find it hard to
explain how there is an infinite number of souls in an order of nature which they require
shall be finite, that it may be known by God.</p>
<p>And now that we have exploded these cycles which were supposed to bring back the
soul at fixed periods to the same miseries, what can seem more in accordance with godly
reason than to believe that it is possible for God both to create new things never before
created, and in doing so, to preserve His will unaltered? But whether the number of
eternally redeemed souls can be continually increased or not, let the philosophers themselves
decide, who are so subtle in determining where infinity cannot be admitted. For our own
part, our reasoning holds in either case. For if the number of souls can be indefinitely increased,
what reason is there to deny that what had never before been created, could be
created? since the number of ransomed souls never existed before, and has yet not only been
once made, but will never cease to be anew coming into being. If, on the other hand, it be
more suitable that the number of eternally ransomed souls be definite, and that this number
will never be increased, yet this number, whatever it be, did assuredly never exist before,
and it cannot increase, and reach the amount it signifies, without having some beginning;

<head>Chapter 21.—That There Was Created at First But One Individual, and that the
Human Race Was Created in Him.</head>
<p>Now that we have solved, as well as we could, this very difficult question about the
eternal God creating new things, without any novelty of will, it is easy to see how much
better it is that God was pleased to produce the human race from the one individual whom
He created, than if He had originated it in several men. For as to the other animals, He
created some solitary, and naturally seeking lonely places,—as the eagles, kites, lions, wolves,
and such like; others gregarious, which herd together, and prefer to live in company,—as
pigeons, starlings, stags, and little fallow deer, and the like: but neither class did He cause
to be propagated from individuals, but called into being several at once. Man, on the other
hand, whose nature was to be a mean between the angelic and bestial, He created in such
sort, that if he remained in subjection to His Creator as his rightful Lord, and piously kept
His commandments, he should pass into the company of the angels, and obtain, without
the intervention of death,565 a blessed and endless immortality; but if he offended the Lord
his God by a proud and disobedient use of his free will, he should become subject to death,
and live as the beasts do,—the slave of appetite, and doomed to eternal punishment after
death. And therefore God created only one single man, not, certainly, that he might be a
solitary, bereft of all society, but that by this means the unity of society and the bond of
concord might be more effectually commended to him, men being bound together not only
by similarity of nature, but by family affection. And indeed He did not even create the woman
that was to be given him as his wife, as he created the man, but created her out of the man,
that the whole human race might derive from one man.</p>

their own kind than men, who had been propagated from one individual for the very purpose
of commending concord. For not even lions or dragons have ever waged with their kind
such wars as men have waged with one another.566 But God foresaw also that by His grace
a people would be called to adoption, and that they, being justified by the remission of their
sins, would be united by the Holy Ghost to the holy angels in eternal peace, the last enemy,
death, being destroyed; and He knew that this people would derive profit from the consideration
that God had caused all men to be derived from one, for the sake of showing how
highly He prizes unity in a multitude.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Of the Nature of the Human Soul Created in the Image of God.</head>
<p>God, then, made man in His own image. For He created for him a soul endowed with
reason and intelligence, so that he might excel all the creatures of earth, air, and sea, which
were not so gifted. And when He had formed the man out of the dust of the earth, and had
willed that his soul should be such as I have said,—whether He had already made it, and
now by breathing imparted it to man, or rather made it by breathing, so that that breath
which God made by breathing (for what else is “to breathe” than to make breath?) is the
soul,567—He made also a wife for him, to aid him in the work of generating his kind, and
her He formed of a bone taken out of the man’s side, working in a divine manner. For we
are not to conceive of this work in a carnal fashion, as if God wrought as we commonly see
artisans, who use their hands, and material furnished to them, that by their artistic skill they
may fashion some material object. God’s hand is God’s power; and He, working invisibly,
effects visible results. But this seems fabulous rather than true to men, who measure by
customary and everyday works the power and wisdom of God, whereby He understands
and produces without seeds even seeds themselves; and because they cannot understand
the things which at the beginning were created, they are sceptical regarding them—as if the
very things which they do know about human propagation, conceptions and births, would
seem less incredible if told to those who had no experience of them; though these very things,
too, are attributed by many rather to physical and natural causes than to the work of the
divine mind.</p>

Least Creature.</head>
<p>But in this book we have nothing to do with those who do not believe that the divine
mind made or cares for this world. As for those who believe their own Plato, that all mortal
animals—among whom man holds the pre-eminent place, and is near to the gods themselves—
were created not by that most high God who made the world, but by other lesser
gods created by the Supreme, and exercising a delegated power under His control,—if only
those persons be delivered from the superstition which prompts them to seek a plausible
reason for paying divine honors and sacrificing to these gods as their creators, they will
easily be disentangled also from this their error. For it is blasphemy to believe or to say
(even before it can be understood) that any other than God is creator of any nature, be it
never so small and mortal. And as for the angels, whom those Platonists prefer to call gods,
although they do, so far as they are permitted and commissioned, aid in the production of
the things around us, yet not on that account are we to call them creators, any more than
we call gardeners the creators of fruits and trees.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
<pb n="561"/>
<head>Chapter 25.—That God Alone is the Creator of Every Kind of Creature, Whatever
Its Nature or Form.</head>
<p>For whereas there is one form which is given from without to every bodily substance,—
such as the form which is constructed by potters and smiths, and that class of artists
who paint and fashion forms like the body of animals,—but another and internal form which
is not itself constructed, but, as the efficient cause, produces not only the natural bodily
forms, but even the life itself of the living creatures, and which proceeds from the secret and
hidden choice of an intelligent and living nature,—let that first-mentioned form be attributed
to every artificer, but this latter to one only, God, the Creator and Originator who made the
world itself and the angels, without the help of world or angels. For the same divine and,
so to speak, creative energy, which cannot be made, but makes, and which gave to the earth
and sky their roundness,—this same divine, effective, and creative energy gave their
roundness to the eye and to the apple; and the other natural objects which we anywhere see,
received also their form, not from without, but from the secret and profound might of the
Creator, who said, “Do not I fill heaven and earth?”568 and whose wisdom it is that “reacheth
from one end to another mightily; and sweetly doth she order all things.”569 Wherefore I
know not what kind of aid the angels, themselves created first, afforded to the Creator in
making other things. I cannot ascribe to them what perhaps they cannot do, neither ought
I to deny them such faculty as they have. But, by their leave, I attribute the creating and
originating work which gave being to all natures to God, to whom they themselves thankfully
ascribe their existence. We do not call gardeners the creators of their fruits, for we read,
“Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.”
570 Nay, not even the earth itself do we call a creator, though she seems to be the
prolific mother of all things which she aids in germinating and bursting forth from the seed,
and which she keeps rooted in her own breast; for we likewise read, “God giveth it a body,
as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body.”571 We ought not even to call a
woman the creatress of her own offspring; for He rather is its creator who said to His servant,
“Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.”572 And although the various mental
emotions of a pregnant woman do produce in the fruit of her womb similar qualities,—as
Jacob with his peeled wands caused piebald sheep to be produced,—yet the mother as little
creates her offspring as she created herself. Whatever bodily or seminal causes, then, may
be used for the production of things, either by the cooperation of angels, men, or the lower

animals, or by sexual generation; and whatever power the desires and mental emotions of
the mother have to produce in the tender and plastic foetus corresponding lineaments and
colors; yet the natures themselves, which are thus variously affected, are the production of
none but the most high God. It is His occult power which pervades all things, and is present
in all without being contaminated, which gives being to all that is, and modifies and limits
its existence; so that without Him it would not be thus, or thus, nor would have any being
at all.573 If, then, in regard to that outward form which the workman’s hand imposes on
his work, we do not say that Rome and Alexandria were built by masons and architects, but
by the kings by whose will, plan, and resources they were built, so that the one has Romulus,
the other Alexander, for its founder; with how much greater reason ought we to say that
God alone is the Author of all natures, since He neither uses for His work any material
which was not made by Him, nor any workmen who were not also made by Him, and since,
if He were, so to speak, to withdraw from created things His creative power, they would
straightway relapse into the nothingness in which they were before they were created?
“Before,” I mean, in respect of eternity, not of time. For what other creator could there be
of time, than He who created those things whose movements make time?574</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—Of that Opinion of the Platonists, that the Angels Were Themselves
Indeed Created by God, But that Afterwards They Created Man’s Body.</head>
<p>It is obvious, that in attributing the creation of the other animals to those inferior gods
who were made by the Supreme, he meant it to be understood that the immortal part was
taken from God Himself, and that these minor creators added the mortal part; that is to say,
he meant them to be considered the creators of our bodies, but not of our souls. But since
Porphyry maintains that if the soul is to be purified all entanglement with a body must be
escaped from; and at the same time agrees with Plato and the Platonistsin thinking that
those who have not spent a temperate and honorable life return to mortal bodies as their
punishment (to bodies of brutes in Plato’s opinion, to human bodies in Porphyry’s); it follows
that those whom they would have us worship as our parents and authors, that they may
plausibly call them gods, are, after all, but the forgers of our fetters and chains,—not our
creators, but our jailers and turnkeys, who lock us up in the most bitter and melancholy
house of correction. Let the Platonists, then, either cease menacing us with our bodies as
the punishment of our souls, or preaching that we are to worship as gods those whose work
upon us they exhort us by all means in our power to avoid and escape from. But, indeed,
both opinions are quite false. It is false that souls return again to this life to be punished;
and it is false that there is any other creator of anything in heaven or earth, than He who
made the heaven and the earth. For if we live in a body only to expiate our sins, how says
Plato in another place, that the world could not have been the most beautiful and good, had
it not been filled with all kinds of creatures, mortal and immortal?575 But if our creation
even as mortals be a divine benefit, how is it a punishment to be restored to a body, that is,
to a divine benefit? And if God, as Plato continually maintains, embraced in His eternal
intelligence the ideas both of the universe and of all the animals, how, then, should He not
with His own hand make them all? Could He be unwilling to be the constructor of works,
the idea and plan of which called for His ineffable and ineffably to be praised intelligence?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—That the Whole Plenitude of the Human Race Was Embraced in the
First Man, and that God There Saw the Portion of It Which Was to Be Honored
and Rewarded, and that Which Was to Be Condemned and Punished.</head>
<p>With good cause, therefore, does the true religion recognize and proclaim that the same
God who created the universal cosmos, created also all the animals, souls as well as bodies.
Among the terrestrial animals man was made by Him in His own image, and, for the reason
I have given, was made one individual, though he was not left solitary. For there is nothing
so social by nature, so unsocial by its corruption, as this race. And human nature has
nothing more appropriate, either for the prevention of discord, or for the healing of it,
where it exists, than the remembrance of that first parent of us all, whom God was pleased
to create alone, that all men might be derived from one, and that they might thus be admonished
to preserve unity among their whole multitude. But from the fact that the woman
was made for him from his side, it was plainly meant that we should learn how dear the
bond between man and wife should be. These works of God do certainly seem extraordinary,
because they are the first works. They who do not believe them, ought not to believe any
prodigies; for these would not be called prodigies did they not happen out of the ordinary
course of nature. But, is it possible that anything should happen in vain, however hidden
be its cause, in so grand a government of divine providence? One of the sacred Psalmists
says, “Come, behold the works of the Lord, what prodigies He hath wrought in the earth.”576
Why God made woman out of man’s side, and what this first prodigy prefigured, I shall,
with God’s help, tell in another place. But at present, since this book must be concluded,
let us merely say that in this first man, who was created in the beginning, there was laid the
foundation, not indeed evidently, but in God’s foreknowledge, of these two cities or societies,
so far as regards the human race. For from that man all men were to be derived—some of
them to be associated with the good angels in their reward, others with the wicked in punishment;
all being ordered by the secret yet just judgment of God. For since it is written,
“All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth,”577 neither can His grace be unjust, nor His
justice cruel.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the very difficult questions concerning the origin of our world and
the beginning of the human race, the natural order requires that we now discuss the fall of
the first man (we may say of the first men), and of the origin and propagation of human
death. For God had not made man like the angels, in such a condition that, even though
they had sinned, they could none the more die. He had so made them, that if they discharged
the obligations of obedience, an angelic immortality and a blessed eternity might ensue,
without the intervention of death; but if they disobeyed, death should be visited on them
with just sentence—which, too, has been spoken to in the preceding book.</p>

<pb n="567"/>
<head>Chapter 2.—Of that Death Which Can Affect an Immortal Soul, and of that to Which
the Body is Subject.</head>
<p>But I see I must speak a little more carefully of the nature of death. For although the
human soul is truly affirmed to be immortal, yet it also has a certain death of its own. For
it is therefore called immortal, because, in a sense, it does not cease to live and to feel; while
the body is called mortal, because it can be forsaken of all life, and cannot by itself live at
all. The death, then, of the soul takes place when God forsakes it, as the death of the body
when the soul forsakes it. Therefore the death of both—that is, of the whole man—occurs
when the soul, forsaken by God, forsakes the body. For, in this case, neither is God the life
of the soul, nor the soul the life of the body. And this death of the whole man is followed
by that which, on the authority of the divine oracles, we call the second death. This the Saviour
referred to when He said, “Fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell.”578 And since this does not happen before the soul is so joined to its body that they
cannot be separated at all, it may be matter of wonder how the body can be said to be killed
by that death in which it is not forsaken by the soul, but, being animated and rendered
sensitive by it, is tormented. For in that penal and everlasting punishment, of which in its
own place we are to speak more at large, the soul is justly said to die, because it does not live
in connection with God; but how can we say that the body is dead, seeing that it lives by the
soul? For it could not otherwise feel the bodily torments which are to follow the resurrection.
Is it because life of every kind is good, and pain an evil, that we decline to say that that body
lives, in which the soul is the cause, not of life, but of pain? The soul, then, lives by God
when it lives well, for it cannot live well unless by God working in it what is good; and the
body lives by the soul when the soul lives in the body, whether itself be living by God or no.
For the wicked man’s life in the body is a life not of the soul, but of the body, which even
dead souls—that is, souls forsaken of God—can confer upon bodies, how little so-ever of
their own proper life, by which they are immortal, they retain. But in the last damnation,
though man does not cease to feel, yet because this feeling of his is neither sweet with
pleasure nor wholesome with repose, but painfully penal, it is not without reason called
death rather than life. And it is called the second death because it follows the first, which
sunders the two cohering essences, whether these be God and the soul, or the soul and the
body. Of the first and bodily death, then, we may say that to the good it is good, and evil
to the evil. But, doubtless, the second, as it happens to none of the good, so it can be good
for none.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Whether Death, Which by the Sin of Our First Parents Has Passed
Upon All Men, is the Punishment of Sin, Even to the Good.</head>
<p>But a question not to be shirked arises: Whether in very truth death, which separates
soul and body, is good to the good?579 For if it be, how has it come to pass that such a thing
should be the punishment of sin? For the first men would not have suffered death had they
not sinned. How, then, can that be good to the good, which could not have happened except
to the evil? Then, again, if it could only happen to the evil, to the good it ought not to be
good, but non-existent. For why should there be any punishment where there is nothing
to punish? Wherefore we must say that the first men were indeed so created, that if they
had not sinned, they would not have experienced any kind of death; but that, having become
sinners, they were so punished with death, that whatsoever sprang from their stock should
also be punished with the same death. For nothing else could be born of them than that
which they themselves had been. Their nature was deteriorated in proportion to the greatness
of the condemnation of their sin, so that what existed as punishment in those who first
sinned, became a natural consequence in their children. For man is not produced by man,
as he was from the dust. For dust was the material out of which man was made: man is the
parent by whom man is begotten. Wherefore earth and flesh are not the same thing, though
flesh be made of earth. But as man the parent is, such is man the offspring. In the first man,
therefore, there existed the whole human nature, which was to be transmitted by the woman
to posterity, when that conjugal union received the divine sentence of its own condemnation;
and what man was made, not when created, but when he sinned and was punished, this he
propagated, so far as the origin of sin and death are concerned. For neither by sin nor its
punishment was he himself reduced to that infantine and helpless infirmity of body and
mind which we see in children. For God ordained that infants should begin the world as
the young of beasts begin it, since their parents had fallen to the level of the beasts in the
fashion of their life and of their death; as it is written, “Man when he was in honor understood
not; he became like the beasts that have no understanding.”580 Nay more, infants, we see,
are even feebler in the use and movement of their limbs, and more infirm to choose and
refuse, than the most tender offspring of other animals; as if the force that dwells in human
nature were destined to surpass all other living things so much the more eminently, as its
energy has been longer restrained, and the time of its exercise delayed, just as an arrow flies
the higher the further back it has been drawn. To this infantine imbecility581 the first man
did not fall by his lawless presumption and just sentence; but human nature was in his person

by sin and punishment, such he generated those whom he begot; that is to say, subject to
sin and death. And if infants are delivered from this bondage of sin by the Redeemer’s grace,
they can suffer only this death which separates soul and body; but being redeemed from the
obligation of sin, they do not pass to that second endless and penal death.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Why Death, the Punishment of Sin, is Not Withheld from Those Who
by the Grace of Regeneration are Absolved from Sin.</head>
<p>If, moreover, any one is solicitous about this point, how, if death be the very punishment
of sin, they whose guilt is cancelled by grace do yet suffer death, this difficulty has already
been handled and solved in our other work which we have written on the baptism of infants.
582 There it was said that the parting of soul and body was left, though its connection
with sin was removed, for this reason, that if the immortality of the body followed immediately
upon the sacrament of regeneration, faith itself would be thereby enervated. For faith
is then only faith when it waits in hope for what is not yet seen in substance. And by the
vigor and conflict of faith, at least in times past, was the fear of death overcome. Specially
was this conspicuous in the holy martyrs, who could have had no victory, no glory, to whom
there could not even have been any conflict, if, after the layer of regeneration, saints could
not suffer bodily death. Who would not, then, in company with the infants presented for
baptism, run to the grace of Christ, that so he might not be dismissed from the body? And
thus faith would not be tested with an unseen reward; and so would not even be faith,
seeking and receiving an immediate recompense of its works. But now, by the greater and
more admirable grace of the Saviour, the punishment of sin is turned to the service of
righteousness. For then it was proclaimed to man, “If thou sinnest, thou shall die;” now it
is said to the martyr, “Die, that thou sin not.” Then it was said, “If ye trangress the commandments,
ye shall die;” now it is said, “If ye decline death, ye transgress the commandment.”
That which was formerly set as an object of terror, that men might not sin, is now
to be undergone if we would not sin. Thus, by the unutterable mercy of God, even the very
punishment of wickedness has become the armor of virtue, and the penalty of the sinner
becomes the reward of the righteous. For then death was incurred by sinning, now righteousness
is fulfilled by dying. In the case of the holy martyrs it is so; for to them the persecutor
proposes the alternative, apostasy or death. For the righteous prefer by believing to
suffer what the first transgressors suffered by not believing. For unless they had sinned,
they would not have died; but the martyrs sin if they do not die. The one died because they
sinned, the others do not sin because they die. By the guilt of the first, punishment was incurred;
by the punishment of the second, guilt is prevented. Not that death, which was before
an evil, has become something good, but only that God has granted to faith this grace, that
death, which is the admitted opposite to life, should become the instrument by which life
is reached.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—As the Wicked Make an Ill Use of the Law, Which is Good, So the Good
Make a Good Use of Death, Which is an Ill.</head>
<p>The apostle, wishing to show how hurtful a thing sin is, when grace does not aid us, has
not hesitated to say that the strength of sin is that very law by which sin is prohibited. “The
sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.”583 Most certainly true; for prohibition
increases the desire of illicit action, if righteousness is not so loved that the desire of sin is
conquered by that love. But unless divine grace aid us, we cannot love nor delight in true
righteousness. But lest the law should be thought to be an evil, since it is called the strength
of sin, the apostle, when treating a similar question in another place, says, “The law indeed
is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is holy made
death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that
which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.”584 Exceeding,
he says, because the transgression is more heinous when through the increasing lust of sin
the law itself also is despised. Why have we thought it worth while to mention this? For
this reason, because, as the law is not an evil when it increases the lust of those who sin, so
neither is death a good thing when it increases the glory of those who suffer it, since either
the former is abandoned wickedly, and makes transgressors, or the latter is embraced, for
the truth’s sake, and makes martyrs. And thus the law is indeed good, because it is prohibition
of sin, and death is evil because it is the wages of sin; but as wicked men make an evil
use not only of evil, but also of good things, so the righteous make a good use not only of
good, but also of evil things. Whence it comes to pass that the wicked make an ill use of the
law, though the law is good; and that the good die well, though death is an evil.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Of the Evil of Death in General, Considered as the Separation of Soul
and Body.</head>
<p>Wherefore, as regards bodily death, that is, the separation of the soul from the body, it
is good unto none while it is being endured by those whom we say are in the article of death.
For the very violence with which body and soul are wrenched asunder, which in the living
had been conjoined and closely intertwined, brings with it a harsh experience, jarring horridly
on nature so long as it continues, till there comes a total loss of sensation, which arose from
the very interpenetration of spirit and flesh. And all this anguish is sometimes forestalled
by one stroke of the body or sudden flitting of the soul, the swiftness of which prevents it
from being felt. But whatever that may be in the dying which with violently painful sensation
robs of all sensation, yet, when it is piously and faithfully borne, it increases the merit of
patience, but does not make the name of punishment inapplicable. Death, proceeding by
ordinary generation from the first man, is the punishment of all who are born of him, yet,
if it be endured for righteousness’ sake, it becomes the glory of those who are born again;
and though death be the award of sin, it sometimes secures that nothing be awarded to sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Of the Death Which the Unbaptized585 Suffer for the Confession of
Christ.</head>
<p>For whatever unbaptized persons die confessing Christ, this confession is of the same
efficacy for the remission of sins as if they were washed in the sacred font of baptism. For
He who said, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God,”586 made also an exception in their favor, in that other sentence where
He no less absolutely said, “Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess also
before my Father which is in heaven;”587 and in another place, “Whosoever will lose his life
for my sake, shall find it.”588 And this explains the verse, “Precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of His saints.”589 For what is more precious than a death by which a man’s sins
are all forgiven, and his merits increased an hundredfold? For those who have been baptized
when they could no longer escape death, and have departed this life with all their sins blotted
out have not equal merit with those who did not defer death, though it was in their power
to do so, but preferred to end their life by confessing Christ, rather than by denying Him
to secure an opportunity of baptism. And even had they denied Him under pressure of the
fear of death, this too would have been forgiven them in that baptism, in which was remitted
even the enormous wickedness of those who had slain Christ. But how abundant in these
men must have been the grace of the Spirit, who breathes where He listeth, seeing that they
so dearly loved Christ as to be unable to deny Him even in so sore an emergency, and with
so sure a hope of pardon! Precious, therefore, is the death of the saints, to whom the grace
of Christ has been applied with such gracious effects, that they do not hesitate to meet death
themselves, if so be they might meet Him. And precious is it, also, because it has proved
that what was originally ordained for the punishment of the sinner, has been used for the
production of a richer harvest of righteousness. But not on this account should we look
upon death as a good thing, for it is diverted to such useful purposes, not by any virtue of
its own, but by the divine interference. Death was originally proposed as an object of dread,
that sin might not be committed; now it must be undergone that sin may not be committed,
or, if committed, be remitted, and the award of righteousness bestowed on him whose victory
has earned it.</p>

Freed from the Second.</head>
<p>For if we look at the matter a little more carefully, we shall see that even when a man
dies faithfully and laudably for the truth’s sake, it is still death he is avoiding. For he submits
to some part of death, for the very purpose of avoiding the whole, and the second and
eternal death over and above. He submits to the separation of soul and body, lest the soul
be separated both from God and from the body, and so the whole first death be completed,
and the second death receive him everlastingly. Wherefore death is indeed, as I said, good
to none while it is being actually suffered, and while it is subduing the dying to its power;
but it is meritoriously endured for the sake of retaining or winning what is good. And regarding
what happens after death, it is no absurdity to say that death is good to the good,
and evil to the evil. For the disembodied spirits of the just are at rest; but those of the wicked
suffer punishment till their bodies rise again,—those of the just to life everlasting, and of
the others to death eternal, which is called the second death.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Whether We Should Say that The Moment of Death, in Which Sensation
Ceases, Occurs in the Experience of the Dying or in that of the Dead.</head>
<p>The point of time in which the souls of the good and evil are separated from the body,
are we to say it is after death, or in death rather? If it is after death, then it is not death which
is good or evil, since death is done with and past, but it is the life which the soul has now
entered on. Death was an evil when it was present, that is to say, when it was being suffered
by the dying; for to them it brought with it a severe and grievous experience, which the good
make a good use of. But when death is past, how can that which no longer is be either good
or evil? Still further, if we examine the matter more closely, we shall see that even that sore
and grievous pain which the dying experience is not death itself. For so long as they have
any sensation, they are certainly still alive; and, if still alive, must rather be said to be in a
state previous to death than in death. For when death actually comes, it robs us of all bodily
sensation, which, while death is only approaching is painful. And thus it is difficult to explain
how we speak of those who are not yet dead, but are agonized in their last and mortal extremity,
as being in the article of death. Yet what else can we call them than dying persons?
for when death which was imminent shall have actually come, we can no longer call them
dying but dead. No one, therefore, is dying unless living; since even he who is in the last
extremity of life, and, as we say, giving up the ghost, yet lives. The same person is therefore
at once dying and living, but drawing near to death, departing from life; yet in life, because
his spirit yet abides in the body; not yet in death, because not yet has his spirit forsaken the
body. But if, when it has forsaken it, the man is not even then in death, but after death, who
shall say when he is in death? On the one hand, no one can be called dying, if a man cannot
be dying and living at the same time; and as long as the soul is in the body, we cannot deny
that he is living. On the other hand, if the man who is approaching death be rather called
dying, I know not who is living.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Of the Life of Mortals, Which is Rather to Be Called Death Than Life.</head>
<p>For no sooner do we begin to live in this dying body, than we begin to move ceaselessly
towards death.590 For in the whole course of this life (if life we must call it) its mutability
tends towards death. Certainly there is no one who is not nearer it this year than last year,
and to-morrow than to-day, and to-day than yesterday, and a short while hence than now,
and now than a short while ago. For whatever time we live is deducted from our whole term
of life, and that which remains is daily becoming less and less; so that our whole life is
nothing but a race towards death, in which no one is allowed to stand still for a little space,
or to go somewhat more slowly, but all are driven forwards with an impartial movement,
and with equal rapidity. For he whose life is short spends a day no more swiftly than he
whose life is longer. But while the equal moments are impartially snatched from both, the
one has a nearer and the other a more remote goal to reach with this their equal speed. It
is one thing to make a longer journey, and another to walk more slowly. He, therefore, who
spends longer time on his way to death does not proceed at a more leisurely pace, but goes
over more ground. Further, if every man begins to die, that is, is in death, as soon as death
has begun to show itself in him (by taking away life, to wit; for when life is all taken away,
the man will be then not in death, but after death), then he begins to die so soon as he begins
to live. For what else is going on in all his days, hours, and moments, until this slow-working
death is fully consummated? And then comes the time after death, instead of that in which
life was being withdrawn, and which we called being in death. Man, then, is never in life
from the moment he dwells in this dying rather than living body,—if, at least, he cannot be
in life and death at once. Or rather, shall we say, he is in both?—in life, namely, which he
lives till all is consumed; but in death also, which he dies as his life is consumed? For if he
is not in life, what is it which is consumed till all be gone? And if he is not in death, what
is this consumption itself? For when the whole of life has been consumed, the expression
“after death” would be meaningless, had that consumption not been death. And if, when
it has all been consumed, a man is not in death but after death, when is he in death unless
when life is being consumed away?</p>
<note type="footnote">590 Much of this paradoxical statement about death is taken from Seneca. See, among other places, his epistle
on the premeditation of future dangers, the passage beginning, Quotidie morimur, quotide enim demitur aliqua

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<pb n="577"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—Whether One Can Both Be Living and Dead at the Same Time.</head>
<p>But if it is absurd to say that a man is in death before he reaches death (for to what is
his course running as he passes through life, if already he is in death?), and if it outrage
common usage to speak of a man being at once alive and dead, as much as it does so to
speak of him as at once asleep and awake, it remains to be asked when a man is dying? For,
before death comes, he is not dying but living; and when death has come, he is not dying
but dead. The one is before, the other after death. When, then, is he in death so that we
can say he is dying? For as there are three times, before death, in death, after death, so there
are three states corresponding, living, dying, dead. And it is very hard to define when a man
is in death or dying, when he is neither living, which is before death, nor dead, which is after
death, but dying, which is in death. For so long as the soul is in the body, especially if consciousness
remain, the man certainly lives; for body and soul constitute the man. And thus,
before death, he cannot be said to be in death, but when, on the other hand, the soul has
departed, and all bodily sensation is extinct, death is past, and the man is dead. Between
these two states the dying condition finds no place; for if a man yet lives, death has not arrived;
if he has ceased to live, death is past. Never, then, is he dying, that is, comprehended
in the state of death. So also in the passing of time,—you try to lay your finger on the present,
and cannot find it, because the present occupies no space, but is only the transition of time
from the future to the past. Must we then conclude that there is thus no death of the body
at all? For if there is, where is it, since it is in no one, and no one can be in it? Since, indeed,
if there is yet life, death is not yet; for this state is before death, not in death: and if life has
already ceased, death is not present; for this state is after death, not in death. On the other
hand, if there is no death before or after, what do we mean when we say “after death,” or
“before death?” This is a foolish way of speaking if there is no death. And would that we
had lived so well in Paradise that in very truth there were now no death! But not only does
it now exist, but so grievous a thing is it, that no skill is sufficient either to explain or to escape
it.</p>
<p>Let us, then, speak in the customary way,—no man ought to speak otherwise,—and let
us call the time before death come, “before death;” as it is written, “Praise no man before
his death.”591 And when it has happened, let us say that “after death” this or that took place.
And of the present time let us speak as best we can, as when we say, “He, when dying, made
his will, and left this or that to such and such persons,”—though, of course, he could not
do so unless he were living, and did this rather before death than in death. And let us use
the same phraseology as Scripture uses; for it makes no scruple of saying that the dead are
not after but in death. So that verse, “For in death there is no remembrance of thee.”592
<note type="footnote">591 Ecclus. xi. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">592 Ps. vi. 5.</note>

<pb n="578"/>
For until the resurrection men are justly said to be in death; as every one is said to be in
sleep till he awakes. However, though we can say of persons in sleep that they are sleeping,
we cannot speak in this way of the dead, and say they are dying. For, so far as regards the
death of the body, of which we are now speaking, one cannot say that those who are already
separated from their bodies continue dying. But this, you see, is just what I was saying,—that
no words can explain how either the dying are said to live, or how the dead are said, even
after death, to be in death. For how can they be after death if they be in death, especially
when we do not even call them dying, as we call those in sleep, sleeping; and those in languor,
languishing; and those in grief, grieving; and those in life, living? And yet the dead, until
they rise again, are said to be in death, but cannot be called dying.</p>
<p>And therefore I think it has not unsuitably nor inappropriately come to pass, though
not by the intention of man, yet perhaps with divine purpose, that this Latin word moritur
cannot be declined by the grammarians according to the rule followed by similar words.
For oritur gives the form ortus est for the perfect; and all similar verbs form this tense from
their perfect participles. But if we ask the perfect of moritur, we get the regular answer
mortuus est, with a double u. For thus mortuus is pronounced, like fatuus, arduus, conspicuus,
and similar words, which are not perfect participles but adjectives, and are declined without
regard to tense. But mortuus, though in form an adjective, is used as perfect participle, as
if that were to be declined which cannot be declined; and thus it has suitably come to pass
that, as the thing itself cannot in point of fact be declined, so neither can the word significant
of the act be declined. Yet, by the aid of our Redeemer’s grace, we may manage at least to
decline the second. For that is more grievous still, and, indeed, of all evils the worst, since
it consists not in the separation of soul and body, but in the uniting of both in death eternal.
And there, in striking contrast to our present conditions, men will not be before or after
death, but always in death; and thus never living, never dead, but endlessly dying. And
never can a man be more disastrously in death than when death itself shall be deathless.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—What Death God Intended, When He Threatened Our First Parents
with Death If They Should Disobey His Commandment.</head>
<p>When, therefore, it is asked what death it was with which God threatened our first parents
if they should transgress the commandment they had received from Him, and should fail
to preserve their obedience,—whether it was the death of soul, or of body, or of the whole
man, or that which is called second death,—we must answer, It is all. For the first consists
of two; the second is the complete death, which consists of all. For, as the whole earth consists
of many lands, and the Church universal of many churches, so death universal consists of
all deaths. The first consists of two, one of the body, and another of the soul. So that the
first death is a death of the whole man, since the soul without God and without the body
suffers punishment for a time; but the second is when the soul, without God but with the
body, suffers punishment everlasting. When, therefore, God said to that first man whom
he had placed in Paradise, referring to the forbidden fruit, “In the day that thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die,”593 that threatening included not only the first part of the first
death, by which the soul is deprived of God; nor only the subsequent part of the first death,
by which the body is deprived of the soul; nor only the whole first death itself, by which the
soul is punished in separation from God and from the body;—but it includes whatever of
death there is, even to that final death which is called second, and to which none is subsequent.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—What Was the First Punishment of the Transgression of Our First
Parents.</head>
<p>For, as soon as our first parents had transgressed the commandment, divine grace forsook
them, and they were confounded at their own wickedness; and therefore they took fig-leaves
(which were possibly the first that came to hand in their troubled state of mind), and covered
their shame; for though their members remained the same, they had shame now where they
had none before. They experienced a new motion of their flesh, which had become disobedient
to them, in strict retribution of their own disobedience to God. For the soul, revelling
in its own liberty, and scorning to serve God, was itself deprived of the command it had
formerly maintained over the body. And because it had willfully deserted its superior Lord,
it no longer held its own inferior servant; neither could it hold the flesh subject, as it would
always have been able to do had it remained itself subject to God. Then began the flesh to
lust against the Spirit,594 in which strife we are born, deriving from the first transgression
a seed of death, and bearing in our members, and in our vitiated nature, the contest or even
victory of the flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—In What State Man Was Made by God, and into What Estate He Fell
by the Choice of His Own Will.</head>
<p>For God, the author of natures, not of vices, created man upright; but man, being of his
own will corrupted, and justly condemned, begot corrupted and condemned children. For
we all were in that one man, since we all were that one man, who fell into sin by the woman
who was made from him before the sin. For not yet was the particular form created and
distributed to us, in which we as individuals were to live, but already the seminal nature was
there from which we were to be propagated; and this being vitiated by sin, and bound by
the chain of death, and justly condemned, man could not be born of man in any other state.
And thus, from the bad use of free will, there originated the whole train of evil, which, with
its concatenation of miseries, convoys the human race from its depraved origin, as from a
corrupt root, on to the destruction of the second death, which has no end, those only being

<head>Chapter 15.—That Adam in His Sin Forsook God Ere God Forsook Him, and that
His Falling Away From God Was the First Death of the Soul.</head>
<p>It may perhaps be supposed that because God said, “Ye shall die the death,”595 and not
“deaths,” we should understand only that death which occurs when the soul is deserted by
God, who is its life; for it was not deserted by God, and so deserted Him, but deserted Him,
and so was deserted by Him. For its own will was the originator of its evil, as God was the
originator of its motions towards good, both in making it when it was not, and in remaking
it when it had fallen and perished. But though we suppose that God meant only this death,
and that the words, “In the day ye eat of it ye shall die the death,” should be understood as
meaning, “In the day ye desert me in disobedience, I will desert you in justice,” yet assuredly
in this death the other deaths also were threatened, which were its inevitable consequence.
For in the first stirring of the disobedient motion which was felt in the flesh of the disobedient
soul, and which caused our first parents to cover their shame, one death indeed is experienced,
that, namely, which occurs when God forsakes the soul. (This was intimated by the
words He uttered, when the man, stupefied by fear, had hid himself, “Adam, where art
thou?”596—words which He used not in ignorance of inquiry, but warning him to consider
where he was, since God was not with him.) But when the soul itself forsook the body,
corrupted and decayed with age, the other death was experienced of which God had spoken
in pronouncing man’s sentence, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return.”597 And
of these two deaths that first death of the whole man is composed. And this first death is
finally followed by the second, unless man be freed by grace. For the body would not return
to the earth from which it was made, save only by the death proper to itself, which occurs
when it is forsaken of the soul, its life. And therefore it is agreed among all Christians who
truthfully hold the catholic faith, that we are subject to the death of the body, not by the law
of nature, by which God ordained no death for man, but by His righteous infliction on account
of sin; for God, taking vengeance on sin, said to the man, in whom we all then were,
“Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return.”</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Concerning the Philosophers Who Think that the Separation of Soul
and Body is Not Penal, Though Plato Represents the Supreme Deity as Promising
to the Inferior Gods that They Shall Never Be Dismissed from Their Bodies.</head>
<p>But the philosophers against whom we are defending the city of God, that is, His Church
seem to themselves to have good cause to deride us, because we say that the separation of
the soul from the body is to be held as part of man’s punishment. For they suppose that the
blessedness of the soul then only is complete, when it is quite denuded of the body, and returns
to God a pure and simple, and, as it were, naked soul. On this point, if I should find
nothing in their own literature to refute this opinion, I should be forced laboriously to
demonstrate that it is not the body, but the corruptibility of the body, which is a burden to
the soul. Hence that sentence of Scripture we quoted in a foregoing book, “For the corruptible
body presseth down the soul.”598 The word corruptible is added to show that the soul is
burdened, not by any body whatsoever, but by the body such as it has become in consequence
of sin. And even though the word had not been added, we could understand nothing else.
But when Plato most expressly declares that the gods who are made by the Supreme have
immortal bodies, and when he introduces their Maker himself, promising them as a great
boon that they should abide in their bodies eternally, and never by any death be loosed from
them, why do these adversaries of ours, for the sake of troubling the Christian faith, feign
to be ignorant of what they quite well know, and even prefer to contradict themselves rather
than lose an opportunity of contradicting us? Here are Plato’s words, as Cicero has translated
them,599 in which he introduces the Supreme addressing the gods He had made, and saying,
“Ye who are sprung from a divine stock, consider of what works I am the parent and author.
These (your bodies) are indestructible so long as I will it; although all that is composed can
be destroyed. But it is wicked to dissolve what reason has compacted. But, seeing that ye
have been born, ye cannot indeed be immortal and indestructible; yet ye shall by no means
be destroyed, nor shall any fates consign you to death, and prove superior to my will, which
is a stronger assurance of your perpetuity than those bodies to which ye were joined when
ye were born.” Plato, you see, says that the gods are both mortal by the connection of the
body and soul, and yet are rendered immortal by the will and decree of their Maker. If,
therefore, it is a punishment to the soul to be connected with any body whatever, why does
God address them as if they were afraid of death, that is, of the separation, of soul and body?
Why does He seek to reassure them by promising them immortality, not in virtue of their
nature, which is composite and not simple, but by virtue of His invincible will, whereby He
can effect that neither things born die, nor things compounded be dissolved, but preserved
eternally?</p>

<p>Whether this opinion of Plato’s about the stars is true or not, is another question. For
we cannot at once grant to him that these luminous bodies or globes, which by day and
night shine on the earth with the light of their bodily substance, have also intellectual and
blessed souls which animate each its own body, as he confidently affirms of the universe itself,
as if it were one huge animal, in which all other animals were contained.600 But this, as I
said, is another question, which we have not undertaken to discuss at present. This much
only I deemed right to bring forward, in opposition to those who so pride themselves on
being, or on being called Platonists, that they blush to be Christians, and who cannot brook
to be called by a name which the common people also bear, lest they vulgarize the philosophers’
coterie, which is proud in proportion to its exclusiveness. These men, seeking a weak
point in the Christian doctrine, select for attack the eternity of the body, as if it were a contradiction
to contend for the blessedness of the soul, and to wish it to be always resident in
the body, bound, as it were, in a lamentable chain; and this although Plato, their own founder
and master, affirms that it was granted by the Supreme as a boon to the gods He had made,
that they should not die, that is, should not be separated from the bodies with which He
had connected them.</p>
<note type="footnote">600 Plato, in the Timæus, represents the Demiurgus as constructing the kosmos or universe to be a complete
representation of the idea of animal. He planted in its centre a soul, spreading outwards so as to pervade the
whole body of the kosmos; and then he introduced into it those various species of animals which were contained
in the idea of animal. Among these animals stand first the celestial, the gods embodied in the stars, and of these
the oldest is the earth, set in the centre of all, close packed round the great axis which traverses the centre of the
kosmos.—See the Timæus and Grote’s Plato, iii. 250 et seq.</note>

<head>Chapter 17.—Against Those Who Affirm that Earthly Bodies Cannot Be Made Incorruptible
and Eternal.</head>
<p>These same philosophers further contend that terrestrial bodies cannot be eternal though
they make no doubt that the whole earth, which is itself the central member of their
god,—not, indeed, of the greatest, but yet of a great god, that is, of this whole world,—is
eternal. Since, then, the Supreme made for them another god, that is, this world, superior
to the other gods beneath Him; and since they suppose that this god is an animal, having,
as they affirm, a rational or intellectual soul enclosed in the huge mass of its body, and
having, as the fitly situated and adjusted members of its body, the four elements, whose
union they wish to be indissoluble and eternal, lest perchance this great god of theirs might
some day perish; what reason is there that the earth, which is the central member in the
body of a greater creature, should be eternal, and the bodies of other terrestrial creatures
should not possibly be eternal if God should so will it? But earth, say they, must return to
earth, out of which the terrestrial bodies of the animals have been taken. For this, they say,
is the reason of the necessity of their death and dissolution, and this the manner of their
restoration to the solid and eternal earth whence they came. But if any one says the same
thing of fire, holding that the bodies which are derived from it to make celestial beings must
be restored to the universal fire, does not the immortality which Plato represents these gods
as receiving from the Supreme evanesce in the heat of this dispute? Or does this not happen
with those celestials because God, whose will, as Plato says, overpowers all powers, has willed
it should not be so? What, then, hinders God from ordaining the same of terrestrial bodies?
And since, indeed, Plato acknowledges that God can prevent things that are born from dying,
and things that are joined from being sundered, and things that are composed from being
dissolved, and can ordain that the souls once allotted to their bodies should never abandon
them, but enjoy along with them immortality and everlasting bliss, why may He not also
effect that terrestrial bodies die not? Is God powerless to do everything that is special to the
Christian’s creed, but powerful to effect everything the Platonists desire? The philosophers,
forsooth, have been admitted to a knowledge of the divine purposes and power which has
been denied to the prophets! The truth is, that the Spirit of God taught His prophets so
much of His will as He thought fit to reveal, but the philosophers, in their efforts to discover
it, were deceived by human conjecture.</p>
<p>But they should not have been so led astray, I will not say by their ignorance, but by
their obstinacy, as to contradict themselves so frequently; for they maintain, with all their
vaunted might, that in order to the happiness of the soul, it must abandon not only its earthly
body, but every kind of body. And yet they hold that the gods, whose souls are most blessed,
are bound to everlasting bodies, the celestials to fiery bodies, and the soul of Jove himself
(or this world, as they would have us believe) to all the physical elements which compose
this entire mass reaching from earth to heaven. For this soul Plato believes to be extended

<pb n="586"/>
and diffused by musical numbers,601 from the middle of the inside of the earth, which geometricians
call the centre, outwards through all its parts to the utmost heights and extremities
of the heavens; so that this world is a very great and blessed immortal animal, whose soul
has both the perfect blessedness of wisdom, and never leaves its own body and whose body
has life everlasting from the soul, and by no means clogs or hinders it, though itself be not
a simple body, but compacted of so many and so huge materials. Since, therefore, they allow
so much to their own conjectures, why do they refuse to believe that by the divine will and
power immortality can be conferred on earthly bodies, in which the souls would be neither
oppressed with the burden of them, nor separated from them by any death, but live eternally
and blessedly? Do they not assert that their own gods so live in bodies of fire, and that Jove
himself, their king, so lives in the physical elements? If, in order to its blessedness, the soul
must quit every kind of body, let their gods flit from the starry spheres, and Jupiter from
earth to sky; or, if they cannot do so, let them be pronounced miserable. But neither alternative
will these men adopt. For, on the one hand, they dare not ascribe to their own gods a
departure from the body, lest they should seem to worship mortals; on the other hand, they
dare not deny their happiness, lest they should acknowledge wretches as gods. Therefore,
to obtain blessedness, we need not quit every kind of body, but only the corruptible, cum-
bersome, painful, dying,—not such bodies as the goodness of God contrived for the first
man, but such only as man’s sin entailed.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—Of Earthly Bodies, Which the Philosophers Affirm Cannot Be in
Heavenly Places, Because Whatever is of Earth is by Its Natural Weight Attracted
to Earth.</head>
<p>But it is necessary, they say, that the natural weight of earthly bodies either keeps them
on earth or draws them to it; and therefore they cannot be in heaven. Our first parents were
indeed on earth, in a well-wooded and fruitful spot, which has been named Paradise. But
let our adversaries a little more carefully consider this subject of earthly weight, because it
has important bearings, both on the ascension of the body of Christ, and also on the resurrection
body of the saints. If human skill can by some contrivance fabricate vessels that
float, out of metals which sink as soon as they are placed on the water, how much more
credible is it that God, by some occult mode of operation, should even more certainly effect
that these earthy masses be emancipated from the downward pressure of their weight? This
cannot be impossible to that God by whose almighty will, according to Plato, neither things
born perish, nor things composed dissolve, especially since it is much more wonderful that
spiritual and bodily essences be conjoined than that bodies be adjusted to other material
substances. Can we not also easily believe that souls, being made perfectly blessed, should
be endowed with the power of moving their earthy but incorruptible bodies as they please,
with almost spontaneous movement, and of placing them where they please with the readiest
action? If the angels transport whatever terrestrial creatures they please from any place they
please, and convey them whither they please, is it to be believed that they cannot do so
without toil and the feeling of burden? Why, then, may we not believe that the spirits of
the saints, made perfect and blessed by divine grace, can carry their own bodies where they
please, and set them where they will? For, though we have been accustomed to notice, in
bearing weights, that the larger the quantity the greater the weight of earthy bodies is, and
that the greater the weight the more burdensome it is, yet the soul carries the members of
its own flesh with less difficulty when they are massive with health, than in sickness when
they are wasted. And though the hale and strong man feels heavier to other men carrying
him than the lank and sickly, yet the man himself moves and carries his own body with less
feeling of burden when he has the greater bulk of vigorous health, than when his frame is
reduced to a minimum by hunger or disease. Of such consequence, in estimating the weight
of earthly bodies, even while yet corruptible and mortal, is the consideration not of dead
weight, but of the healthy equilibrium of the parts. And what words can tell the difference
between what we now call health and future immortality? Let not the philosophers, then,
think to upset our faith with arguments from the weight of bodies; for I don’t care to inquire
why they cannot believe an earthly body can be in heaven, while the whole earth is suspended
on nothing. For perhaps the world keeps its central place by the same law that attracts to
its centre all heavy bodies. But this I say, if the lesser gods, to whom Plato committed the

<pb n="588"/>
creation of man and the other terrestrial creatures, were able, as he affirms, to withdraw
from the fire its quality of burning, while they left it that of lighting, so that it should shine
through the eyes; and if to the supreme God Plato also concedes the power of preserving
from death things that have been born, and of preserving from dissolution things that are
composed of parts so different as body and spirit;—are we to hesitate to concede to this
same God the power to operate on the flesh of him whom He has endowed with immortality,
so as to withdraw its corruption but leave its nature, remove its burdensome weight but retain
its seemly form and members? But concerning our belief in the resurrection of the dead,
and concerning their immortal bodies, we shall speak more at large, God willing, in the end
of this work.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Against the Opinion of Those Who Do Not Believe that the Primitive
Men Would Have Been Immortal If They Had Not Sinned.</head>
<p>At present let us go on, as we have begun, to give some explanation regarding the bodies
of our first parents. I say then, that, except as the just consequence of sin, they would not
have been subjected even to this death, which is good to the good,—this death, which is not
exclusively known and believed in by a few, but is known to all, by which soul and body are
separated, and by which the body of an animal which was but now visibly living is now
visibly dead. For though there can be no manner of doubt that the souls of the just and holy
dead live in peaceful rest, yet so much better would it be for them to be alive in healthy,
well-conditioned bodies, that even those who hold the tenet that it is most blessed to be
quit of every kind of body, condemn this opinion in spite of themselves. For no one will
dare to set wise men, whether yet to die or already dead,—in other words, whether already
quit of the body, or shortly to be so,—above the immortal gods, to whom the Supreme, in
Plato, promises as a munificent gift life indissoluble, or in eternal union with their bodies.
But this same Plato thinks that nothing better can happen to men than that they pass through
life piously and justly, and, being separated from their bodies, be received into the bosom
of the gods, who never abandon theirs; “that, oblivious of the past, they may revisit the upper
air, and conceive the longing to return again to the body.”602 Virgil is applauded for borrowing
this from the Platonic system. Assuredly Plato thinks that the souls of mortals cannot
always be in their bodies, but must necessarily be dismissed by death; and, on the other
hand, he thinks that without bodies they cannot endure for ever, but with ceaseless alternation
pass from life to death, and from death to life. This difference, however, he sets between
wise men and the rest, that they are carried after death to the stars, that each man may repose
for a while in a star suitable for him, and may thence return to the labors and miseries of
mortals when he has become oblivious of his former misery, and possessed with the desire
of being embodied. Those, again, who have lived foolishly transmigrate into bodies fit for
them, whether human or bestial. Thus he has appointed even the good and wise souls to a
very hard lot indeed, since they do not receive such bodies as they might always and even
immortally inhabit, but such only as they can neither permanently retain nor enjoy eternal
purity without. Of this notion of Plato’s, we have in a former book already said603 that
Porphyry was ashamed in the light of these Christian times, so that he not only emancipated
human souls from a destiny in the bodies of beasts but also contended for the liberation of
the souls of the wise from all bodily ties, so that, escaping from all flesh, they might, as bare
and blessed souls, dwell with the Father time without end. And that he might not seem to
be outbid by Christ’s promise of life everlasting to His saints, he also established purified
<note type="footnote">602 Virgil, Æn, vi. 750, 751.</note>
<note type="footnote">603 Book x. 30.</note>

<pb n="590"/>
souls in endless felicity, without return to their former woes; but, that he might contradict
Christ, he denies the resurrection of incorruptible bodies, and maintains that these souls
will live eternally, not only without earthly bodies, but without any bodies at all. And yet,
whatever he meant by this teaching, he at least did not teach that these souls should offer
no religious observance to the gods who dwelt in bodies. And why did he not, unless because
he did not believe that the souls, even though separate from the body, were superior to those
gods? Wherefore, if these philosophers will not dare (as I think they will not) to set human
souls above the gods who are most blessed, and yet are tied eternally to their bodies, why
do they find that absurd which the Christian faith preaches,604 namely, that our first parents
were so created that, if they had not sinned, they would not have been dismissed from their
bodies by any death, but would have been endowed with immortality as the reward of their
obedience, and would have lived eternally with their bodies; and further, that the saints will
in the resurrection inhabit those very bodies in which they have here toiled, but in such sort
that neither shall any corruption or unwieldiness be suffered to attach to their flesh, nor
any grief or trouble to cloud their felicity?</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—That the Flesh Now Resting in Peace Shall Be Raised to a Perfection
Not Enjoyed by the Flesh of Our First Parents.</head>
<p>Thus the souls of departed saints are not affected by the death which dismisses them
from their bodies, because their flesh rests in hope, no matter what indignities it receives
after sensation is gone. For they do not desire that their bodies be forgotten, as Plato thinks
fit, but rather, because they remember what has been promised by Him who deceives no
man, and who gave them security for the safe keeping even of the hairs of their head, they
with a longing patience wait in hope of the resurrection of their bodies, in which they have
suffered many hardships, and are now to suffer never again. For if they did not “hate their
own flesh,” when it, with its native infirmity, opposed their will, and had to be constrained
by the spiritual law, how much more shall they love it, when it shall even itself have become
spiritual! For as, when the spirit serves the flesh, it is fitly called carnal, so, when the flesh
serves the spirit, it will justly be called spiritual. Not that it is converted into spirit, as some
fancy from the words, “It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption,”605 but because
it is subject to the spirit with a perfect and marvellous readiness of obedience, and responds
in all things to the will that has entered on immortality,— all reluctance, all corruption, and
all slowness being removed. For the body will not only be better than it was here in its best
estate of health, but it will surpass the bodies of our first parents ere they sinned. For, though
they were not to die unless they should sin, yet they used food as men do now, their bodies
not being as yet spiritual, but animal only. And though they decayed not with years, nor
drew nearer to death,—a condition secured to them in God’s marvellous grace by the tree
of life, which grew along with the forbidden tree in the midst of Paradise,—yet they took
other nourishment, though not of that one tree, which was interdicted not because it was
itself bad, but for the sake of commending a pure and simple obedience, which is the great
virtue of the rational creature set under the Creator as his Lord. For, though no evil thing
was touched, yet if a thing forbidden was touched, the very disobedience was sin. They
were, then, nourished by other fruit, which they took that their animal bodies might not
suffer the discomfort of hunger or thirst; but they tasted the tree of life, that death might
not steal upon them from any quarter, and that they might not, spent with age, decay.
Other fruits were, so to speak, their nourishment, but this their sacrament. So that the tree
of life would seem to have been in the terrestrial Paradise what the wisdom of God is in the
spiritual, of which it is written, “She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her.”606</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Of Paradise, that It Can Be Understood in a Spiritual Sense Without
Sacrificing the Historic Truth of the Narrative Regarding The Real Place.</head>
<p>On this account some allegorize all that concerns Paradise itself, where the first men,
the parents of the human race, are, according to the truth of holy Scripture, recorded to
have been; and they understand all its trees and fruit-bearing plants as virtues and habits of
life, as if they had no existence in the external world, but were only so spoken of or related
for the sake of spiritual meanings. As if there could not be a real terrestrial Paradise! As if
there never existed these two women, Sarah and Hagar, nor the two sons who were born to
Abraham, the one of the bond woman, the other of the free, because the apostle says that
in them the two covenants were prefigured; or as if water never flowed from the rock when
Moses struck it, because therein Christ can be seen in a figure, as the same apostle says,
“Now that rock was Christ!”607 No one, then, denies that Paradise may signify the life of
the blessed; its four rivers, the four virtues, prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice; its
trees, all useful knowledge; its fruits, the customs of the godly; its tree of life, wisdom herself,
the mother of all good; and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the experience of a
broken commandment. The punishment which God appointed was in itself, a just, and
therefore a good thing; but man’s experience of it is not good.</p>
<p>These things can also and more profitably be understood of the Church, so that they
become prophetic foreshadowings of things to come. Thus Paradise is the Church, as it is
called in the Canticles;608 the four rivers of Paradise are the four gospels; the fruit-trees the
saints, and the fruit their works; the tree of life is the holy of holies, Christ; the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, the will’s free choice. For if man despise the will of God, he
can only destroy himself; and so he learns the difference between consecrating himself to
the common good and revelling in his own. For he who loves himself is abandoned to
himself, in order that, being overwhelmed with fears and sorrows, he may cry, if there be
yet soul in him to feel his ills, in the words of the psalm, “My soul is cast down within me,”609
and when chastened, may say,” Because of his strength I will wait upon Thee.”610 These
and similar allegorical interpretations may be suitably put upon Paradise without giving
offence to any one, while yet we believe the strict truth of the history, confirmed by its circumstantial
narrative of facts.611</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—That the Bodies of the Saints Shall After the Resurrection Be Spiritual,
and Yet Flesh Shall Not Be Changed into Spirit.</head>
<p>The bodies of the righteous, then, such as they shall be in the resurrection, shall need
neither any fruit to preserve them from dying of disease or the wasting decay of old age, nor
any other physical nourishment to allay the cravings of hunger or of thirst; for they shall be
invested with so sure and every way inviolable an immortality, that they shall not eat save
when they choose, nor be under the necessity of eating, while they enjoy the power of doing
so. For so also was it with the angels who presented themselves to the eye and touch of men,
not because they could do no otherwise, but because they were able and desirous to suit
themselves to men by a kind of manhood ministry. For neither are we to suppose, when
men receive them as guests, that the angels eat only in appearance, though to any who did
not know them to be angels they might seem to eat from the same necessity as ourselves.
So these words spoken in the Book of Tobit, “You saw me eat, but you saw it but in vision;”612
that is, you thought I took food as you do for the sake of refreshing my body. But if in the
case of the angels another opinion seems more capable of defence, certainly our faith leaves
no room to doubt regarding our Lord Himself, that even after His resurrection, and when
now in spiritual but yet real flesh, He ate and drank with His disciples; for not the power,
but the need, of eating and drinking is taken from these bodies. And so they will be spiritual,
not because they shall cease to be bodies, but because they shall subsist by the quickening
spirit.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—What We are to Understand by the Animal and Spiritual Body; Or of
Those Who Die in Adam, And of Those Who are Made Alive in Christ.</head>
<p>For as those bodies of ours, that have a living soul, though not as yet a quickening spirit,
are called soul-informed bodies, and yet are not souls but bodies, so also those bodies are
called spiritual,—yet God forbid we should therefore suppose them to be spirits and not
bodies,—which, being quickened by the Spirit, have the substance, but not the unwieldiness
and corruption of flesh. Man will then be not earthly but heavenly,—not because the body
will not be that very body which was made of earth, but because by its heavenly endowment
it will be a fit inhabitant of heaven, and this not by losing its nature, but by changing its
quality. The first man, of the earth earthy, was made a living soul, not a quickening spirit,—
which rank was reserved for him as the reward of obedience. And therefore his body,
which required meat and drink to satisfy hunger and thirst, and which had no absolute and
indestructible immortality, but by means of the tree of life warded off the necessity of dying,
and was thus maintained in the flower of youth,—this body, I say, was doubtless not spiritual,
but animal; and yet it would not have died but that it provoked God’s threatened vengeance
by offending. And though sustenance was not denied him even outside Paradise, yet, being
forbidden the tree of life, he was delivered over to the wasting of time, at least in respect of
that life which, had he not sinned, he might have retained perpetually in Paradise, though
only in an animal body, till such time as it became spiritual in acknowledgment of his
obedience.</p>
<p>Wherefore, although we understand that this manifest death, which consists in the
separation of soul and body, was also signified by God when He said, “In the day thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die,”613 it ought not on that account to seem absurd that they were
not dismissed from the body on that very day on which they took the forbidden and deathbringing
fruit. For certainly on that very day their nature was altered for the worse and
vitiated, and by their most just banishment from the tree of life they were involved in the
necessity even of bodily death, in which necessity we are born. And therefore the apostle
does not say, “The body indeed is doomed to die on account of sin,” but he says, “The body
indeed is dead because of sin.” Then he adds, “But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus
from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.”614 Then accordingly shall the body become
a quickening spirit which is now a living soul; and yet the apostle calls it “dead,” because
already it lies under the necessity of dying. But in Paradise it was so made a living soul,
though not a quickening spirit, that it could not properly be called dead, for, save through
the commission of sin, it could not come under the power of death. Now, since God by the
<note type="footnote">613 Gen. ii. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">614 Rom. viii. 10, 11.</note>

<pb n="595"/>
words, “Adam, where art thou?” pointed to the death of the soul, which results when He
abandons it, and since in the words, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,”615
He signified the death of the body, which results when the soul departs from it, we are led,
therefore, to believe that He said nothing of the second death, wishing it to be kept hidden,
and reserving it for the New Testament dispensation, in which it is most plainly revealed.
And this He did in order that, first of all, it might be evident that this first death, which is
common to all, was the result of that sin which in one man became common to all.616 But
the second death is not common to all, those being excepted who were “called according to
His purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did pre destinate to be conformed to
the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren.”617 Those the
grace of God has, by a Mediator, delivered from the second death.</p>
<p>Thus the apostle states that the first man was made in an animal body. For, wishing to
distinguish the animal body which now is from the spiritual, which is to be in the resurrection,
he says, “It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonor,
it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body,
it is raised a spiritual body.” Then, to prove this, he goes on, “There is a natural body, and
there is a spiritual body.” And to show what the animated body is, he says, “Thus it was
written, The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening
spirit.”618 He wished thus to show what the animated body is, though Scripture did not say
of the first man Adam, when his soul was created by the breath of God, “Man was made in
an animated body,” but “Man was made a living soul.”619 By these words, therefore, “The
first man was made a living soul,” the apostle wishes man’s animated body to be understood.
But how he wishes the spiritual body to be understood he shows when he adds, “But the
last Adam was made a quickening spirit,” plainly referring to Christ, who has so risen from
the dead that He cannot die any more. He then goes on to say, “But that was not first which
is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.” And here he
much more clearly asserts that he referred to the animal body when he said that the first
man was made a living soul, and to the spiritual when he said that the last man was made
a quickening spirit. The animal body is the first, being such as the first Adam had, and
which would not have died had he not sinned, being such also as we now have, its nature
being changed and vitiated by sin to the extent of bringing us under the necessity of death,
and being such as even Christ condescended first of all to assume, not indeed of necessity,

but of choice; but afterwards comes the spiritual body, which already is worn by anticipation
by Christ as our head, and will be worn by His members in the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Then the apostle subjoins a notable difference between these two men, saying, “The
first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy,
such are they also that are earthy, and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.”
620 So he elsewhere says, “As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
on Christ;”621 but in very deed this shall be accomplished when that which is animal in us
by our birth shall have become spiritual in our resurrection. For, to use his words again,”
We are saved by hope.”622 Now we bear the image of the earthly man by the propagation
of sin and death, which pass on us by ordinary generation; but we bear the image of the
heavenly by the grace of pardon and life eternal, which regeneration confers upon us through
the Mediator of God and men, the Man Christ Jesus. And He is the heavenly Man of Paul’s
passage, because He came from heaven to be clothed with a body of earthly mortality, that
He might clothe it with heavenly immortality. And he calls others heavenly, because by
grace they become His members, that, together with them, He may become one Christ, as
head and body. In the same epistle he puts this yet more clearly: “Since by man came death,
by Man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
shall all be made alive,”623—that is to say, in a spiritual body which shall be made a quickening
spirit. Not that all who die in Adam shall be members of Christ,—for the great majority
shall be punished in eternal death,—but he uses the word “all” in both clauses, because,
as no one dies in an animal body except in Adam, so no one is quickened a spiritual body
save in Christ. We are not, then, by any means to suppose that we shall in the resurrection
have such a body as the first man had before he sinned, nor that the words, “As is the earthy
such are they also that are earthy,” are to be understood of that which was brought about
by sin; for we are not to think that Adam had a spiritual body before he fell, and that, in
punishment of his sin, it was changed into an animal body. If this be thought, small heed
has been given to the words of so great a teacher, who says, “There is a natural body, there
is also a spiritual body; as it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul.” Was
it after sin he was made so? or was not this the primal condition of man from which the
blessed apostle selects his testimony to show what the animal body is?</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—How We Must Understand that Breathing of God by Which “The
First Man Was Made a Living Soul,” And that Also by Which the Lord Conveyed
His Spirit to His Disciples When He Said, “Receive Ye the Holy Ghost.”</head>
<p>Some have hastily supposed from the words, “God breathed into Adam’s nostrils the
breath of life, and man became a living soul,624” that a soul was not then first given to man,
but that the soul already given was quickened by the Holy Ghost. They are encouraged in
this supposition by the fact that the Lord Jesus after His resurrection breathed on His disciples,
and said, “Receive ye the Holy Spirit.”625 From this they suppose that the same thing
was effected in either case, as if the evangelist had gone on to say, And they became living
souls. But if he had made this addition, we should only understand that the Spirit is in some
way the life of souls, and that without Him reasonable souls must be accounted dead, though
their bodies seem to live before our eyes. But that this was not what happened when man
was created, the very words of the narrative sufficiently show: “And God made man dust
of the earth;” which some have thought to render more clearly by the words, “And God
formed man of the clay of the earth.” For it had before been said that “there went up a mist
from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground,”626 in order that the reference to
clay, formed of this moisture and dust, might be understood. For on this verse there immediately
follows the announcement, “And God created man dust of the earth;” so those Greek
manuscripts have it from which this passage has been translated into Latin. But whether
one prefers to read “created” or “formed,” where the Greek reads ἔπλασεν, is of little importance;
yet “formed” is the better rendering. But those who preferred “created” thought they
thus avoided the ambiguity arising from the fact, that in the Latin language the usage obtains
that those are said to form a thing who frame some feigned and fictitious thing. This man,
then, who was created of the dust of the earth, or of the moistened dust or clay,—this “dust
of the earth” (that I may use the express words of Scripture) was made, as the apostle teaches,
an animated body when he received a soul. This man, he says, “was made a living soul;”
that is, this fashioned dust was made a living soul.</p>
<p>They say, Already he had a soul, else he would not be called a man; for man is not a
body alone, nor a soul alone, but a being composed of both. This, indeed, is true, that the
soul is not the whole man, but the better part of man; the body not the whole, but the inferior
part of man; and that then, when both are joined, they receive the name of man, which,
however, they do not severally lose even when we speak of them singly. For who is prohibited
from saying, in colloquial usage, “That man is dead, and is now at rest or in torment,” though
this can be spoken only of the soul; or “He is buried in such and such a place,” though this

<pb n="598"/>
refers only to the body? Will they say that Scripture follows no such usage? On the contrary,
it so thoroughly adopts it, that even while a man is alive, and body and soul are united, it
calls each of them singly by the name “man,” speaking of the soul as the “inward man,” and
of the body as the “outward man,”627 as if there were two men, though both together are
indeed but one. But we must understand in what sense man is said to be in the image of
God, and is yet dust, and to return to the dust. The former is spoken of the rational soul,
which God by His breathing, or, to speak more appropriately, by His inspiration, conveyed
to man, that is, to his body; but the latter refers to his body, which God formed of the dust,
and to which a soul was given, that it might become a living body, that is, that man might
become a living soul.</p>
<p>Wherefore, when our Lord breathed on His disciples, and said, “Receive ye the Holy
Ghost,” He certainly wished it to be understood that the Holy Ghost was not only the Spirit
of the Father, but of the only begotten Son Himself. For the same Spirit is, indeed, the
Spirit of the Father and of the Son, making with them the trinity of Father, Son, and Spirit,
not a creature, but the Creator. For neither was that material breath which proceeded from
the mouth of His flesh the very substance and nature of the Holy Spirit, but rather the intimation,
as I said, that the Holy Spirit was common to the Father and to the Son; for they have
not each a separate Spirit, but both one and the same. Now this Spirit is always spoken of
in sacred Scripture by the Greek word πνεῦμα, as the Lord, too, named Him in the place
cited when He gave Him to His disciples, and intimated the gift by the breathing of His lips;
and there does not occur to me any place in the whole Scriptures where He is otherwise
named. But in this passage where it is said, “And the Lord formed man dust of the earth,
and breathed, or inspired, into his face the breath of life;” the Greek has not πνεῦμα, the
usual word for the Holy Spirit, but πνοή, a word more frequently used of the creature than
of the Creator; and for this reason some Latin interpreters have preferred to render it by
“breath” rather than “spirit.” For this word occurs also in the Greek in Isaiah chapter vii,
verse 16 where God says, “I have made all breath,” meaning, doubtless, all souls. Accordingly,
this word πνοή is sometimes rendered “breath,” sometimes “spirit,” sometimes “inspiration,”
sometimes “aspiration,” sometimes “soul,” even when it is used of God. Πνεῦμα, on the
other hand, is uniformly rendered “spirit,” whether of man, of whom the apostle says, “For
what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?”628 or of
beast, as in the book of Solomon, “Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and
the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?”629 or of that physical spirit which
is called wind, for so the Psalmist calls it: “Fire and hail; snow and vapors; stormy wind;”630

<pb n="599"/>
or of the uncreated Creator Spirit, of whom the Lord said in the gospel, “Receive ye the Holy
Ghost,” indicating the gift by the breathing of His mouth; and when He says, “Go ye and
baptize all nations in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,”631 words
which very expressly and excellently commend the Trinity; and where it is said, “God is a
Spirit;”632 and in very many other places of the sacred writings. In all these quotations from
Scripture we do not find in the Greek the word πνοή used, but πνεῦμα, and in the Latin,
not flatus, but spiritus. Wherefore, referring again to that place where it is written, “He inspired,”
or to speak more properly, “breathed into his face the breath of life,” even though
the Greek had not used πνοή (as it has) but πνεῦμα, it would not on that account necessarily
follow that the Creator Spirit, who in the Trinity is distinctively called the Holy Ghost, was
meant, since, as has been said, it is plain that πνεῦμα is used not only of the Creator, but
also of the creature.</p>
<p>But, say they, when the Scripture used the word “spirit,”633 it would not have added “of
life” unless it meant us to understand the Holy Spirit; nor, when it said, “Man became a
soul,” would it also have inserted the word “living” unless that life of the soul were signified
which is imparted to it from above by the gift of God. For, seeing that the soul by itself has
a proper life of its own, what need, they ask, was there of adding living, save only to show
that the life which is given it by the Holy Spirit was meant? What is this but to fight
strenuously for their own conjectures, while they carelessly neglect the teaching of Scripture?
Without troubling themselves much, they might have found in a preceding page of this very
book of Genesis the words, “Let the earth bring forth the living soul,”634 when all the terrestrial
animals were created. Then at a slight interval, but still in the same book, was it
impossible for them to notice this verse, “All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all
that was in the dry land, died,” by which it was signified that all the animals which lived on
the earth had perished in the deluge? If, then, we find that Scripture is accustomed to speak
both of the “living soul” and the “spirit of life” even in reference to beasts; and if in this
place, where it is said, “All things which have the spirit of life,” the word πνοή, not πνεῦμα,
is used; why may we not say, What need was there to add “living,” since the soul cannot
exist without being alive? or, What need to add “of life” after the word spirit? But we understand
that Scripture used these expressions in its ordinary style so long as it speaks of animals,
that is, animated bodies, in which the soul serves as the residence of sensation; but when
man is spoken of, we forget the ordinary and established usage of Scripture, whereby it signifies
that man received a rational soul, which was not produced out of the waters and the

earth like the other living creatures, but was created by the breath of God. Yet this creation
was ordered that the human soul should live in an animal body, like those other animals of
which the Scripture said, “Let the earth produce every living soul,” and regarding which it
again says that in them is the breath of life, where the word πνοή and not πνεῦμα is used
in the Greek, and where certainly not the Holy Spirit, but their spirit, is signified under that
name.</p>
<p>But, again, they object that breath is understood to have been emitted from the mouth
of God; and if we believe that is the soul, we must consequently acknowledge it to be of the
same substance, and equal to that wisdom, which says, “I come out of the mouth of the Most
High.”635 Wisdom, indeed, does not say it was breathed out of the mouth of God, but
proceeded out of it. But as we are able, when we breathe, to make a breath, not of our own
human nature, but of the surrounding air, which we inhale and exhale as we draw our breath
and breathe again, so almighty God was able to make breath, not of His own nature, nor of
the creature beneath Him, but even of nothing; and this breath, when He communicated it
to man’s body, He is most appropriately said to have breathed or inspired,—the Immaterial
breathing it also immaterial, but the Immutable not also the immutable; for it was created,
He uncreated. Yet that these persons who are forward to quote Scripture, and yet know not
the usages of its language, may know that not only what is equal and consubstantial with
God is said to proceed out of His mouth, let them hear or read what God says: “So then
because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.”636</p>
<p>There is no ground, then, for our objecting, when the apostle so expressly distinguishes
the animal body from the spiritual—that is to say, the body in which we now are from that
in which we are to be. He says, “It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There
is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam
was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not
first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The
first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy,
such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.”
637 Of all which words of his we have previously spoken. The animal body, accordingly,
in which the apostle says that the first man Adam was made, was not so made that it could
not die at all, but so that it should not die unless he should have sinned. That body, indeed,
which shall be made spiritual and immortal by the quickening Spirit shall not be able to die
at all; as the soul has been created immortal, and therefore, although by sin it may be said

to die, and does lose a certain life of its own, namely, the Spirit of God, by whom it was enabled
to live wisely and blessedly, yet it does not cease living a kind of life, though a miserable,
because it is immortal by creation. So, too, the rebellious angels, though by sinning they
did in a sense die, because they forsook God, the Fountain of life, which while they drank
they were able to live wisely and well, yet they could not so die as to utterly cease living and
feeling, for they are immortals by creation. And so, after the final judgment, they shall be
hurled into the second death, and not even there be deprived of life or of sensation, but shall
suffer torment. But those men who have been embraced by God’s grace, and are become
the fellow-citizens of the holy angels who have continued in bliss, shall never more either
sin or die, being endued with spiritual bodies; yet, being clothed with immortality, such as
the angels enjoy, of which they cannot be divested even by sinning, the nature of their flesh
shall continue the same, but all carnal corruption and unwieldiness shall be removed.</p>
<p>There remains a question which must be discussed, and, by the help of the Lord God
of truth, solved: If the motion of concupiscence in the unruly members of our first parents
arose out of their sin, and only when the divine grace deserted them; and if it was on that
occasion that their eyes were opened to see, or, more exactly, notice their nakedness, and
that they covered their shame because the shameless motion of their members was not
subject to their will,—how, then, would they have begotten children had they remained
sinless as they were created? But as this book must be concluded, and so large a question
cannot be summarily disposed of, we may relegate it to the following book, in which it will
be more conveniently treated.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—That the Disobedience of the First Man Would Have Plunged All Men
into the Endless Misery of the Second Death, Had Not the Grace of God Rescued
Many.</head>
<p>We have already stated in the preceding books that God, desiring not only that the human
race might be able by their similarity of nature to associate with one another, but also that
they might be bound together in harmony and peace by the ties of relationship, was pleased
to derive all men from one individual, and created man with such a nature that the members
of the race should not have died, had not the two first (of whom the one was created out of
nothing, and the other out of him) merited this by their disobedience; for by them so great
a sin was committed, that by it the human nature was altered for the worse, and was transmitted
also to their posterity, liable to sin and subject to death. And the kingdom of death
so reigned over men, that the deserved penalty of sin would have hurled all headlong even
into the second death, of which there is no end, had not the undeserved grace of God saved
some therefrom. And thus it has come to pass, that though there are very many and great
nations all over the earth, whose rites and customs, speech, arms, and dress, are distinguished
by marked differences, yet there are no more than two kinds of human society, which we
may justly call two cities, according to the language of our Scriptures. The one consists of
those who wish to live after the flesh, the other of those who wish to live after the spirit; and
when they severally achieve what they wish, they live in peace, each after their kind.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Of Carnal Life, Which is to Be Understood Not Only of Living in Bodily
Indulgence, But Also of Living in the Vices of the Inner Man.</head>
<p>First, we must see what it is to live after the flesh, and what to live after the spirit. For
any one who either does not recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language of sacred
Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose that the Epicurean philosophers
live after the flesh, because they place man’s highest good in bodily pleasure; and that those
others do so who have been of opinion that in some form or other bodily good is man’s supreme
good; and that the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or philosophizing
on the subject, are so prone to lust that they cannot delight in any pleasure save such as they
receive from bodily sensations: and he may suppose that the Stoics, who place the supreme
good of men in the soul, live after the spirit; for what is man’s soul, if not spirit? But in the
sense of the divine Scripture both are proved to live after the flesh. For by flesh it means
not only the body of a terrestrial and mortal animal, as when it says, “All flesh is not the
same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes,
another of birds,”639 but it uses this word in many other significations; and among these
various usages, a frequent one is to use flesh for man himself, the nature of man taking the
part for the whole, as in the words, “By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified;”
640 for what does he mean here by “no flesh” but “no man?” And this, indeed, he
shortly after says more plainly: “No man shall be justified by the law;”641 and in the Epistle
to the Galatians, “Knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law.” And so we
understand the words, “And the Word was made flesh,”642—that is, man, which some not
accepting in its right sense, have supposed that Christ had not a human soul.643 For as the
whole is used for the part in the words of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel, “They have taken
away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him,”644 by which she meant only the
flesh of Christ, which she supposed had been taken from the tomb where it had been buried,
so the part is used for the whole, flesh being named, while man is referred to, as in the
quotations above cited.</p>
<p>Since, then, Scripture uses the word flesh in many ways, which there is not time to collect
and investigate, if we are to ascertain what it is to live after the flesh (which is certainly evil,
though the nature of flesh is not itself evil), we must carefully examine that passage of the
epistle which the Apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians, in which he says, “Now the works of

the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings,
murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have
also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
God.”645 This whole passage of the apostolic epistle being considered, so far as it bears on
the matter in hand, will be sufficient to answer the question, what it is to live after the flesh.
For among the works of the flesh which he said were manifest, and which he cited for condemnation,
we find not only those which concern the pleasure of the flesh, as fornications,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, drunkenness, revellings, but also those which, though they be
remote from fleshly pleasure, reveal the vices of the soul. For who does not see that idolatries,
witchcrafts, hatreds, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, are vices rather
of the soul than of the flesh? For it is quite possible for a man to abstain from fleshly pleasures
for the sake of idolatry or some heretical error; and yet, even when he does so, he is proved
by this apostolic authority to be living after the flesh; and in abstaining from fleshly pleasure,
he is proved to be practising damnable works of the flesh. Who that has enmity has it not
in his soul? or who would say to his enemy, or to the man he thinks his enemy, You have a
bad flesh towards me, and not rather, You have a bad spirit towards me? In fine, if any one
heard of what I may call “carnalities,” he would not fail to attribute them to the carnal part
of man; so no one doubts that “animosities” belong to the soul of man. Why then does the
doctor of the Gentiles in faith and verity call all these and similar things works of the flesh,
unless because, by that mode of speech whereby the part is used for the whole, he means us
to understand by the word flesh the man himself?</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—That the Sin is Caused Not by the Flesh, But by the Soul, and that the
Corruption Contracted from Sin is Not Sin But Sin’s Punishment.</head>
<p>But if any one says that the flesh is the cause of all vices and ill conduct, inasmuch as
the soul lives wickedly only because it is moved by the flesh, it is certain he has not carefully
considered the whole nature of man. For “the corruptible body, indeed, weigheth down the
soul.”646 Whence, too, the apostle, speaking of this corruptible body, of which he had shortly
before said, “though our outward man perish,”647 says, “We know that if our earthly house
of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our
house which is from heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For
we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed,
but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up in life.”648 We are then burdened
with this corruptible body; but knowing that the cause of this burdensomeness is not the
nature and substance of the body, but its corruption, we do not desire to be deprived of the
body, but to be clothed with its immortality. For then, also, there will be a body, but it shall
no longer be a burden, being no longer corruptible. At present, then, “the corruptible body
presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth
upon many things,” nevertheless they are in error who suppose that all the evils of the soul
proceed from the body.</p>

vices, saying,—

<p>yet we believe quite otherwise. For the corruption of the body, which weighs down the
soul, is not the cause but the punishment of the first sin; and it was not the corruptible flesh
that made the soul sinful, but the sinful soul that made the flesh corruptible. And though
from this corruption of the flesh there arise certain incitements to vice, and indeed vicious
desires, yet we must not attribute to the flesh all the vices of a wicked life, in case we thereby
clear the devil of all these, for he has no flesh. For though we cannot call the devil a fornicator
or drunkard, or ascribe to him any sensual indulgence (though he is the secret instigator
and prompter of those who sin in these ways), yet he is exceedingly proud and envious.
And this viciousness has so possessed him, that on account of it he is reserved in chains of
darkness to everlasting punishment.651 Now these vices, which have dominion over the
devil, the apostle attributes to the flesh, which certainly the devil has not. For he says “hatred,
variance, emulations, strife, envying” are the works of the flesh; and of all these evils pride
is the origin and head, and it rules in the devil though he has no flesh. For who shows more
hatred to the saints? who is more at variance with them? who more envious, bitter, and
jealous? And since he exhibits all these works, though he has no flesh, how are they works
of the flesh, unless because they are the works of man, who is, as I said, spoken of under the
name of flesh? For it is not by having flesh, which the devil has not, but by living according
to himself,—that is, according to man,—that man became like the devil. For the devil too,
wished to live according to himself when he did not abide in the truth; so that when he lied,
this was not of God, but of himself, who is not only a liar, but the father of lies, he being the
first who lied, and the originator of lying as of sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—What It is to Live According to Man, and What to Live According to
God.</head>
<p>When, therefore, man lives according to man, not according to God, he is like the devil.
Because not even an angel might live according to an angel, but only according to God, if
he was to abide in the truth, and speak God’s truth and not his own lie. And of man, too,
the same apostle says in another place, “If the truth of God hath more abounded through
my lie;”652—“my lie,” he said, and “God’s truth.” When, then, a man lives according to the
truth, he lives not according to himself, but according to God; for He was God who said, “I
am the truth.”653 When, therefore, man lives according to himself,—that is, according to
man, not according to God,—assuredly he lives according to a lie; not that man himself is
a lie, for God is his author and creator, who is certainly not the author and creator of a lie,
but because man was made upright, that he might not live according to himself, but according
to Him that made him,—in other words, that he might do His will and not his own; and
not to live as he was made to live, that is a lie. For he certainly desires to be blessed even by
not living so that he may be blessed. And what is a lie if this desire be not? Wherefore it is
not without meaning said that all sin is a lie. For no sin is committed save by that desire or
will by which we desire that it be well with us, and shrink from it being ill with us. That,
therefore, is a lie which we do in order that it may be well with us, but which makes us more
miserable than we were. And why is this, but because the source of man’s happiness lies
only in God, whom he abandons when he sins, and not in himself, by living according to
whom he sins?</p>
<p>In enunciating this proposition of ours, then, that because some live according to the
flesh and others according to the spirit, there have arisen two diverse and conflicting cities,
we might equally well have said, “because some live according to man, others according to
God.” For Paul says very plainly to the Corinthians, “For whereas there is among you
envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?”654 So that to walk accord-
ing to man and to be carnal are the same; for by flesh, that is, by a part of man, man is
meant. For before he said that those same persons were animal whom afterwards he calls
carnal, saying, “For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is
in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have
received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the
things which are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words
which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
things with spiritual. But the animal man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for

they are foolishness unto him.”655 It is to men of this kind, then, that is, to animal men, he
shortly after says, “And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal.”656 And this is to be interpreted by the same usage, a part being taken for the whole.
For both the soul and the flesh, the component parts of man, can be used to signify the
whole man; and so the animal man and the carnal man are not two different things, but one
and the same thing, viz., man living according to man. In the same way it is nothing else
than men that are meant either in the words, “By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh
be justified;”657 or in the words, “Seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob.”658
In the one passage, “no flesh” signifies “no man;” and in the other, by “seventy-five souls”
seventy-five men are meant. And the expression, “not in words which man’s wisdom
teacheth” might equally be “not in words which fleshly wisdom teacheth;” and the expression,
“ye walk according to man,” might be “according to the flesh.” And this is still more apparent
in the words which followed: “For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of
Apollos, are ye not men?” The same thing which he had before expressed by “ye are animal,”
“ye are carnal, he now expresses by “ye are men;” that is, ye live according to man, not according
to God, for if you lived according to Him, you should be gods.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—That the Opinion of the Platonists Regarding the Nature of Body and
Soul is Not So Censurable as that of the Manichæans, But that Even It is Objectionable,
Because It Ascribes the Origin of Vices to the Nature of The Flesh.</head>
<p>There is no need, therefore, that in our sins and vices we accuse the nature of the flesh
to the injury of the Creator, for in its own kind and degree the flesh is good; but to desert
the Creator good, and live according to the created good, is not good, whether a man choose
to live according to the flesh, or according to the soul, or according to the whole human
nature, which is composed of flesh and soul, and which is therefore spoken of either by the
name flesh alone, or by the name soul alone. For he who extols the nature of the soul as the
chief good, and condemns the nature of the flesh as if it were evil, assuredly is fleshly both
in his love of the soul and hatred of the flesh; for these his feelings arise from human fancy,
not from divine truth. The Platonists, indeed, are not so foolish as, with the Manichæans,
to detest our present bodies as an evil nature;659 for they attribute all the elements of which
this visible and tangible world is compacted, with all their qualities, to God their Creator.
Nevertheless, from the death-infected members and earthly construction of the body they
believe the soul is so affected, that there are thus originated in it the diseases of desires, and
fears, and joy, and sorrow, under which four perturbations, as Cicero660 calls them, or passions,
as most prefer to name them with the Greeks, is included the whole viciousness of
human life. But if this be so, how is it that Æneas in Virgil, when he had heard from his
father in Hades that the souls should return to bodies, expresses surprise at this declaration,
and exclaims:
<lg>
<l>“O father! and can thought conceive</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>That happy souls this realm would leave,
And seek the upper sky,</p>
<p>With sluggish clay to reunite?</p>
<p>This direful longing for the light,
Whence comes it, say, and why?”661</p>
<p>This direful longing, then, does it still exist even in that boasted purity of the disembodied
spirits, and does it still proceed from the death-infected members and earthly limbs? Does
he not assert that, when they begin to long to return to the body, they have already been
delivered from all these so-called pestilences of the body? From which we gather that, were
this endlessly alternating purification and defilement of departing and returning souls as
true as it is most certainly false, yet it could not be averred that all culpable and vicious

<pb n="611"/>
motions of the soul originate in the earthly body; for, on their own showing, “this direful
longing,” to use the words of their noble exponent, is so extraneous to the body, that it
moves the soul that is purged of all bodily taint, and is existing apart from any body whatever,
and moves it, moreover, to be embodied again. So that even they themselves acknowledge
that the soul is not only moved to desire, fear, joy, sorrow, by the flesh, but that it can also
be agitated with these emotions at its own instance.</p>

<pb n="612"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—Of the Character of the Human Will Which Makes the Affections of
the Soul Right or Wrong.</head>
<p>But the character of the human will is of moment; because, if it is wrong, these motions
of the soul will be wrong, but if it is right, they will be not merely blameless, but even
praiseworthy. For the will is in them all; yea, none of them is anything else than will. For
what are desire and joy but a volition of consent to the things we wish? And what are fear
and sadness but a volition of aversion from the things which we do not wish? But when
consent takes the form of seeking to possess the things we wish, this is called desire; and
when consent takes the form of enjoying the things we wish, this is called joy. In like manner,
when we turn with aversion from that which we do not wish to happen, this volition is
termed fear; and when we turn away from that which has happened against our will, this
act of will is called sorrow. And generally in respect of all that we seek or shun, as a man’s
will is attracted or repelled, so it is changed and turned into these different affections.
Wherefore the man who lives according to God, and not according to man, ought to be a
lover of good, and therefore a hater of evil. And since no one is evil by nature, but whoever
is evil is evil by vice, he who lives according to God ought to cherish towards evil men a
perfect hatred, so that he shall neither hate the man because of his vice, nor love the vice
because of the man, but hate the vice and love the man. For the vice being cursed, all that
ought to be loved, and nothing that ought to be hated, will remain.</p>

<pb n="613"/>
<head>Chapter 7.—That the Words Love and Regard (Amor and Dilectio) are in Scripture
Used Indifferently of Good and Evil Affection.</head>
<p>He who resolves to love God, and to love his neighbor as himself, not according to man
but according to God, is on account of this love said to be of a good will; and this is in
Scripture more commonly called charity, but it is also, even in the same books, called love.
For the apostle says that the man to be elected as a ruler of the people must be a lover of
good.662 And when the Lord Himself had asked Peter, “Hast thou a regard for me (diligis)
more than these?” Peter replied, “Lord, Thou knowest that I love (amo) Thee.” And again
a second time the Lord asked not whether Peter loved (amaret) Him, but whether he had a
regard (diligeret)for Him, and, he again answered, “Lord, Thou knowest that I love (amo)
Thee.” But on the third interrogation the Lord Himself no longer says, “Hast thou a regard
(diligis) for me,”but “Lovest thou (amas) me?” And then the evangelist adds, “Peter was
grieved because He said unto him the third time, “Lovest thou (amas) me?” though the Lord
had not said three times but only once, “Lovest thou (amas) me?” and twice “Diligis me ?”
from which we gather that, even when the Lord said “diligis,” He used an equivalent for
“amas.” Peter, too, throughout used one word for the one thing, and the third time also
replied, “Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love (amo) Thee.”663</p>
<p>I have judged it right to mention this, because some are of opinion that charity or regard
(dilectio) is one thing, love (amor) another. They say that dilectio is used of a good affection,
amor of an evil love. But it is very certain that even secular literature knows no such distinction.
However, it is for the philosophers to determine whether and how they differ, though
their own writings sufficiently testify that they make great account of love (amor) placed
on good objects, and even on God Himself. But we wished to show that the Scriptures of
our religion, whose authority we prefer to all writings whatsoever, make no distinction
between amor, dilectio, and caritas; and we have already shown that amor is used in a good
connection. And if any one fancy that amor is no doubt used both of good and bad loves,
but that dilectio is reserved for the good only, let him remember what the psalm says, “He
that loveth (diligit) iniquity hateth his own soul;”664 and the words of the Apostle John, “If
any man love (diligere) the world, the love (dilectio) of the Father is not in him.”665 Here
you have in one passage dilectio used both in a good and a bad sense. And if any one demands
an instance of amor being used in a bad sense (for we have already shown its use in a good
<note type="footnote">662 Tit. i. 8, according to Greek and Vulgate.</note>

<pb n="614"/>
sense), let him read the words, “For men shall be lovers (amantes) of their own selves, lovers
(amatores) of money.”666</p>
<p>The right will is, therefore, well-directed love, and the wrong will is ill-directed love.
Love, then, yearning to have what is loved, is desire; and having and enjoying it, is joy;
fleeing what is opposed to it, it is fear; and feeling what is opposed to it, when it has befallen
it, it is sadness. Now these motions are evil if the love is evil; good if the love is good. What
we assert let us prove from Scripture. The apostle “desires to depart, and to be with
Christ.”667 And, “My soul desired to long for Thy judgments;”668 or if it is more appropriate
to say, “My soul longed to desire Thy judgments.” And, “The desire of wisdom bringeth to
a kingdom.”669 Yet there has always obtained the usage of understanding desire and concupiscence
in a bad sense if the object be not defined. But joy is used in a good sense: “Be
glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous.”670 And, “Thou hast put gladness in my heart.”671
And, “Thou wilt fill me with joy with Thy countenance.”672 Fear is used in a good sense by
the apostle when he says, “Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.”673 And, “Be
not high-minded, but fear.”674 And, “I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ.”675 But with respect to sadness, which Cicero prefer to calls sickness (oegritudo),
and Virgil pain (dolor) (as he says, “Dolent gaudentque”676), but which I prefer to call sorrow,
because sickness and pain are more commonly used to express bodily suffering,—with respect
to this emotion, I say, the question whether it can be used in a good sense is more difficult.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Of the Three Perturbations, Which the Stoics Admitted in the Soul of
the Wise Man to the Exclusion of Grief or Sadness, Which the Manly Mind
Ought Not to Experience.</head>
<p>Those emotions which the Greeks call εὐπαθείαι, and which Cicero calls constantioe,
the Stoics would restrict to three; and, instead of three “perturbations” in the soul of the
wise man, they substituted severally, in place of desire, will; in place of joy, contentment;
and for fear, caution; and as to sickness or pain, which we, to avoid ambiguity, preferred to
call sorrow, they denied that it could exist in the mind of a wise man. Will, they say, seeks
the good, for this the wise man does. Contentment has its object in good that is possessed,
and this the wise man continually possesses. Caution avoids evil, and this the wise man
ought to avoid. But sorrow arises from evil that has already happened; and as they suppose
that no evil can happen to the wise man, there can be no representative of sorrow in his
mind. According to them, therefore, none but the wise man wills, is contented, uses caution;
and that the fool can do no more than desire, rejoice, fear, be sad. The former three affections
Cicero calls constantioe, the last four perturbationes. Many, however, calls these last passions;
and, as I have said, the Greeks call the former εὐπαθείαι, and the latter πάθη. And when I
made a careful examination of Scripture to find whether this terminology was sanctioned
by it, I came upon this saying of the prophet: “There is no contentment to the wicked, saith
the Lord;”677 as if the wicked might more properly rejoice than be contented regarding evils,
for contentment is the property of the good and godly. I found also that verse in the Gospel:
“Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them?”678 which
seems to imply that evil or shameful things may be the object of desire, but not of will. Indeed,
some interpreters have added “good things,” to make the expression more in conformity
with customary usage, and have given this meaning, “Whatsoever good deeds that ye would
that men should do unto you.” For they thought that this would prevent any one from
wishing other men to provide him with unseemly, not to say shameful gratifications,—luxurious
banquets, for example,—on the supposition that if he returned the like to them he
would be fulfilling this precept. In the Greek Gospel, however, from which the Latin is
translated, “good” does not occur, but only, “All things whatsoever ye would that men should
do unto you, do ye even so unto them,” and, as I believe, because “good” is already included
in the word “would;” for He does not say “desire.”</p>
<p>Yet though we may sometimes avail ourselves of these precise proprieties of language,
we are not to be always bridled by them; and when we read those writers against whose authority
it is unlawful to reclaim, we must accept the meanings above mentioned in passages
where a right sense can be educed by no other interpretation, as in those instances we adduced
<note type="footnote">677 Isa. lvii. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">678 Matt. vii. 12.</note>

<pb n="616"/>
partly from the prophet, partly from the Gospel. For who does not know that the wicked
exult with joy? Yet “there is no contentment for the wicked, saith the Lord.” And how so,
unless because contentment, when the word is used in its proper and distinctive significance,
means something different from joy? In like manner, who would deny that it were wrong
to enjoin upon men that whatever they desire others to do to them they should themselves
do to others, lest they should mutually please one another by shameful and illicit pleasure?
And yet the precept, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to
them,” is very wholesome and just. And how is this, unless because the will is in this place
used strictly, and signifies that will which cannot have evil for its object? But ordinary
phraseology would not have allowed the saying, “Be unwilling to make any manner of lie,”679
had there not been also an evil will, whose wickedness separates if from that which the angels
celebrated, “Peace on earth, of good will to men.”680 For “good” is superfluous if there is
no other kind of will but good will. And why should the apostle have mentioned it among
the praises of charity as a great thing, that “it rejoices not in iniquity,” unless because
wickedness does so rejoice? For even with secular writers these words are used indifferently.
For Cicero, that most fertile of orators, says, “I desire, conscript fathers, to be merciful.”681
And who would be so pedantic as to say that he should have said “I will” rather than “I desire,”
because the word is used in a good connection? Again, in Terence, the profligate
youth, burning with wild lust, says, “I will nothing else than Philumena.”682 That this “will”
was lust is sufficiently indicated by the answer of his old servant which is there introduced:
“How much better were it to try and banish that love from your heart, than to speak so as
uselessly to inflame your passion still more!” And that contentment was used by secular
writers in a bad sense that verse of Virgil testifies, in which he most succinctly comprehends
these four perturbations,—
<lg>
<l>“Hence they fear and desire, grieve and are content”683</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>The same author had also used the expression, “the evil contentments of the mind.”684
So that good and bad men alike will, are cautious, and contented; or, to say the same thing
in other words, good and bad men alike desire, fear, rejoice, but the former in a good, the
latter in a bad fashion, according as the will is right or wrong. Sorrow itself, too, which the
Stoics would not allow to be represented in the mind of the wise man, is used in a good

sense, and especially in our writings. For the apostle praises the Corinthians because they
had a godly sorrow. But possibly some one may say that the apostle congratulated them
because they were penitently sorry, and that such sorrow can exist only in those who have
sinned. For these are his words: “For I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry,
though it were but for a season. Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye
sorrowed to repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive
damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
of, but the sorrow of the world worketh death. For, behold, this selfsame thing that
ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you!”685 Consequently the
Stoics may defend themselves by replying,686 that sorrow is indeed useful for repentance
of sin, but that this can have no place in the mind of the wise man, inasmuch as no sin attaches
to him of which he could sorrowfully repent, nor any other evil the endurance or
experience of which could make him sorrowful. For they say that Alcibiades (if my memory
does not deceive me), who believed himself happy, shed tears when Socrates argued with
him, and demonstrated that he was miserable because he was foolish. In his case, therefore,
folly was the cause of this useful and desirable sorrow, wherewith a man mourns that he is
what he ought not to be. But the Stoics maintain not that the fool, but that the wise man,
cannot be sorrowful.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Of the Perturbations of the Soul Which Appear as Right Affections in
the Life of the Righteous.</head>
<p>But so far as regards this question of mental perturbations, we have answered these
philosophers in the ninth book687 of this work, showing that it is rather a verbal than a real
dispute, and that they seek contention rather than truth. Among ourselves, according to
the sacred Scriptures and sound doctrine, the citizens of the holy city of God, who live according
to God in the pilgrimage of this life, both fear and desire, and grieve and rejoice.
And because their love is rightly placed, all these affections of theirs are right. They fear
eternal punishment, they desire eternal life; they grieve because they themselves groan
within themselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of their body;688 they rejoice
in hope, because there “shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
up in victory.”689 In like manner they fear to sin, they desire to persevere; they grieve in
sin, they rejoice in good works. They fear to sin, because they hear that “because iniquity
shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”690 They desire to persevere, because they
hear that it is written, “He that endureth to the end shall be saved.”691 They grieve for sin,
hearing that “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.”692 They rejoice in good works, because they hear that “the Lord loveth a cheerful
giver.”693 In like manner, according as they are strong or weak, they fear or desire to be
tempted, grieve or rejoice in temptation. They fear to be tempted, because they hear the
injunction, “If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in
the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”694 They desire to be
tempted, because they hear one of the heroes of the city of God saying, “Examine me, O
Lord, and tempt me: try my reins and my heart.”695 They grieve in temptations, because
they see Peter weeping;696 they rejoice in temptations, because they hear James saying, “My
brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.”697</p>

<p>And not only on their own account do they experience these emotions, but also on account
of those whose deliverance they desire and whose perdition they fear, and whose loss
or salvation affects them with grief or with joy. For if we who have come into the Church
from among the Gentiles may suitably instance that noble and mighty hero who glories in
his infirmities, the teacher (doctor) of the nations in faith and truth, who also labored more
than all his fellow-apostles, and instructed the tribes of God’s people by his epistles, which
edified not only those of his own time, but all those who were to be gathered in,—that hero,
I say, and athlete of Christ, instructed by Him, anointed of His Spirit, crucified with Him,
glorious in Him, lawfully maintaining a great conflict on the theatre of this world, and being
made a spectacle to angels and men,698 and pressing onwards for the prize of his high calling,
699—very joyfully do we with the eyes of faith behold him rejoicing with them that rejoice,
and weeping with them that weep;700 though hampered by fightings without and fears
within;701 desiring to depart and to be with Christ;702 longing to see the Romans, that he
might have some fruit among them as among other Gentiles;703 being jealous over the
Corinthians, and fearing in that jealousy lest their minds should be corrupted from the
chastity that is in Christ;704 having great heaviness and continual sorrow of heart for the
Israelites,705 because they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish
their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God;706
and expressing not only his sorrow, but bitter lamentation over some who had formally
sinned and had not repented of their uncleanness and fornications.707</p>
<p>If these emotions and affections, arising as they do from the love of what is good and
from a holy charity, are to be called vices, then let us allow these emotions which are truly
vices to pass under the name of virtues. But since these affections, when they are exercised
in a becoming way, follow the guidance of right reason, who will dare to say that they are
diseases or vicious passions? Wherefore even the Lord Himself, when He condescended to
lead a human life in the form of a slave, had no sin whatever, and yet exercised these emotions
where He judged they should be exercised. For as there was in Him a true human body and

a true human soul, so was there also a true human emotion. When, therefore, we read in
the Gospel that the hard-heartedness of the Jews moved Him to sorrowful indignation,708
that He said, “I am glad for your sakes, to the intent ye may believe,”709 that when about to
raise Lazarus He even shed tears,710 that He earnestly desired to eat the passover with His
disciples,711 that as His passion drew near His soul was sorrowful,712 these emotions are
certainly not falsely ascribed to Him. But as He became man when it pleased Him, so, in
the grace of His definite purpose, when it pleased Him He experienced those emotions in
His human soul.</p>
<p>But we must further make the admission, that even when these affections are well regulated,
and according to God’s will, they are peculiar to this life, not to that future life we
look for, and that often we yield to them against our will. And thus sometimes we weep in
spite of ourselves, being carried beyond ourselves, not indeed by culpable desire; but by
praiseworthy charity. In us, therefore, these affections arise from human infirmity; but it
was not so with the Lord Jesus, for even His infirmity was the consequence of His power.
But so long as we wear the infirmity of this life, we are rather worse men than better if we
have none of these emotions at all. For the apostle vituperated and abominated some who,
as he said, were “without natural affection.”713 The sacred Psalmist also found fault with
those of whom he said, “I looked for some to lament with me, and there was none.”714 For
to be quite free from pain while we are in this place of misery is only purchased, as one of
this world’s literati perceived and remarked,715 at the price of blunted sensibilities both of
mind and body. And therefore that which the Greeks call ἀπαθεια, and what the Latins
would call, if their language would allow them, “impassibilitas,” if it be taken to mean an
impassibility of spirit and not of body, or, in other words, a freedom from those emotions
which are contrary to reason and disturb the mind, then it is obviously a good and most
desirable quality, but it is not one which is attainable in this life. For the words of the apostle
are the confession, not of the common herd, but of the eminently pious, just, and holy men:
“If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”716 When there
shall be no sin in a man, then there shall be this απάθεια. At present it is enough if we live

without crime; and he who thinks he lives without sin puts aside not sin, but pardon. And
if that is to be called apathy, where the mind is the subject of no emotion, then who would
not consider this insensibility to be worse than all vices? It may, indeed, reasonably be
maintained that the perfect blessedness we hope for shall be free from all sting of fear or
sadness; but who that is not quite lost to truth would say that neither love nor joy shall be
experienced there? But if by apathy a condition be meant in which no fear terrifies nor any
pain annoys, we must in this life renounce such a state if we would live according to God’s
will, but may hope to enjoy it in that blessedness which is promised as our eternal condition.</p>
<p>For that fear of which the Apostle John says, “There is no fear in love; but perfect love
casteth out fear, because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in
love,”717—that fear is not of the same kind as the Apostle Paul felt lest the Corinthians
should be seduced by the subtlety of the serpent; for love is susceptible of this fear, yea, love
alone is capable of it. But the fear which is not in love is of that kind of which Paul himself
says, “For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear.”718 But as for that “clean
fear which endureth for ever,”719 if it is to exist in the world to come (and how else can it
be said to endure for ever?), it is not a fear deterring us from evil which may happen, but
preserving us in the good which cannot be lost. For where the love of acquired good is unchangeable,
there certainly the fear that avoids evil is, if I may say so, free from anxiety. For
under the name of “clean fear” David signifies that will by which we shall necessarily shrink
from sin, and guard against it, not with the anxiety of weakness, which fears that we may
strongly sin, but with the tranquillity of perfect love. Or if no kind of fear at all shall exist
in that most imperturbable security of perpetual and blissful delights, then the expression,
“The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever,” must be taken in the same sense as that
other, “The patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.”720 For patience, which is necessary
only where ills are to be borne, shall not be eternal, but that which patience leads us to will
be eternal. So perhaps this “clean fear” is said to endure for ever, because that to which fear
leads shall endure.</p>
<p>And since this is so,—since we must live a good life in order to attain to a blessed life,
a good life has all these affections right, a bad life has them wrong. But in the blessed life
eternal there will be love and joy, not only right, but also assured; but fear and grief there
will be none. Whence it already appears in some sort what manner of persons the citizens
of the city of God must be in this their pilgrimage, who live after the spirit, not after the
flesh,—that is to say, according to God, not according to man,—and what manner of persons

they shall be also in that immortality whither they are journeying. And the city or society
of the wicked, who live not according to God, but according to man, and who accept the
doctrines of men or devils in the worship of a false and contempt of the true divinity, is
shaken with those wicked emotions as by diseases and disturbances. And if there be some
of its citizens who seem to restrain and, as it were, temper those passions, they are so elated
with ungodly pride, that their disease is as much greater as their pain is less. And if some,
with a vanity monstrous in proportion to its rarity, have become enamored of themselves
because they can be stimulated and excited by no emotion, moved or bent by no affection,
such persons rather lose all humanity than obtain true tranquillity. For a thing is not necessarily
right because it is inflexible, nor healthy because it is insensible.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Whether It is to Be Believed that Our First Parents in Paradise, Before
They Sinned, Were Free from All Perturbation.</head>
<p>But it is a fair question, whether our first parent or first parents (for there was a marriage
of two), before they sinned, experienced in their animal body such emotions as we shall not
experience in the spiritual body when sin has been purged and finally abolished. For if they
did, then how were they blessed in that boasted place of bliss, Paradise? For who that is affected
by fear or grief can be called absolutely blessed? And what could those persons fear
or suffer in such affluence of blessings, where neither death nor ill-health was feared, and
where nothing was wanting which a good will could desire, and nothing present which could
interrupt man’s mental or bodily enjoyment? Their love to God was unclouded, and their
mutual affection was that of faithful and sincere marriage; and from this love flowed a
wonderful delight, because they always enjoyed what was loved. Their avoidance of sin was
tranquil; and, so long as it was maintained, no other ill at all could invade them and bring
sorrow. Or did they perhaps desire to touch and eat the forbidden fruit, yet feared to die;
and thus both fear and desire already, even in that blissful place, preyed upon those first of
mankind? Away with the thought that such could be the case where there was no sin! And,
indeed, this is already sin, to desire those things which the law of God forbids, and to abstain
from them through fear of punishment, not through love of righteousness. Away, I say,
with the thought, that before there was any sin, there should already have been committed
regarding that fruit the very sin which our Lord warns us against regarding a woman:
“Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already
in his heart.”721 As happy, then, as were these our first parents, who were agitated by no
mental perturbations, and annoyed by no bodily discomforts, so happy should the whole
human race have been, had they not introduced that evil which they have transmitted to
their posterity, and had none of their descendants committed iniquity worthy of damnation;
but this original blessedness continuing until, in virtue of that benediction which said, “Increase
and multiply,”722 the number of the predestined saints should have been completed,
there would then have been bestowed that higher felicity which is enjoyed by the most
blessed angels,—a blessedness in which there should have been a secure assurance that no
one would sin, and no one die; and so should the saints have lived, after no taste of labor,
pain, or death, as now they shall live in the resurrection, after they have endured all these
things.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Of the Fall of the First Man, in Whom Nature Was Created Good, and
Can Be Restored Only by Its Author.</head>
<p>But because God foresaw all things, and was therefore not ignorant that man also would
fall, we ought to consider this holy city in connection with what God foresaw and ordained,
and not according to our own ideas, which do not embrace God’s ordination. For man, by
his sin, could not disturb the divine counsel, nor compel God to change what He had decreed;
for God’s foreknowledge had anticipated both,—that is to say, both how evil the man whom
He had created good should become, and what good He Himself should even thus derive
from him. For though God is said to change His determinations (so that in a tropical sense
the Holy Scripture says even that God repented723), this is said with reference to man’s expectation,
or the order of natural causes, and not with reference to that which the Almighty
had foreknown that He would do. Accordingly God, as it is written, made man upright,724
and consequently with a good will. For if he had not had a good will, he could not have
been upright. The good will, then, is the work of God; for God created him with it. But the
first evil will, which preceded all man’s evil acts, was rather a kind of falling away from the
work of God to its own works than any positive work. And therefore the acts resulting were
evil, not having God, but the will itself for their end; so that the will or the man himself, so
far as his will is bad, was as it were the evil tree bringing forth evil fruit. Moreover, the bad
will, though it be not in harmony with, but opposed to nature, inasmuch as it is a vice or
blemish, yet it is true of it as of all vice, that it cannot exist except in a nature, and only in a
nature created out of nothing, and not in that which the Creator has begotten of Himself,
as He begot the Word, by whom all things were made. For though God formed man of the
dust of the earth, yet the earth itself, and every earthly material, is absolutely created out of
nothing; and man’s soul, too, God created out of nothing, and joined to the body, when He
made man. But evils are so thoroughly overcome by good, that though they are permitted
to exist, for the sake of demonstrating how the most righteous foresight of God can make
a good use even of them, yet good can exist without evil, as in the true and supreme God
Himself, and as in every invisible and visible celestial creature that exists above this murky
atmosphere; but evil cannot exist without good, because the natures in which evil exists, in
so far as they are natures, are good. And evil is removed, not by removing any nature, or
part of a nature, which had been introduced by the evil, but by healing and correcting that
which had been vitiated and depraved. The will, therefore, is then truly free, when it is not
the slave of vices and sins. Such was it given us by God; and this being lost by its own fault,
can only be restored by Him who was able at first to give it. And therefore the truth says,

“If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed;”725 which is equivalent to saying, If
the Son shall save you, ye shall be saved indeed. For He is our Liberator, inasmuch as He
is our Saviour.</p>
<p>Man then lived with God for his rule in a paradise at once physical and spiritual. For
neither was it a paradise only physical for the advantage of the body, and not also spiritual
for the advantage of the mind; nor was it only spiritual to afford enjoyment to man by his
internal sensations, and not also physical to afford him enjoyment through his external
senses. But obviously it was both for both ends. But after that proud and therefore envious
angel (of whose fall I have said as much as I was able in the eleventh and twelfth books of
this work, as well as that of his fellows, who, from being God’s angels, became his angels),
preferring to rule with a kind of pomp of empire rather than to be another’s subject, fell
from the spiritual Paradise, and essaying to insinuate his persuasive guile into the mind of
man, whose unfallen condition provoked him to envy now that himself was fallen, he chose
the serpent as his mouthpiece in that bodily Paradise in which it and all the other earthly
animals were living with those two human beings, the man and his wife, subject to them,
and harmless; and he chose the serpent because, being slippery, and moving in tortuous
windings, it was suitable for his purpose. And this animal being subdued to his wicked ends
by the presence and superior force of his angelic nature, he abused as his instrument, and
first tried his deceit upon the woman, making his assault upon the weaker part of that human
alliance, that he might gradually gain the whole, and not supposing that the man would
readily give ear to him, or be deceived, but that he might yield to the error of the woman.
For as Aaron was not induced to agree with the people when they blindly wished him to
make an idol, and yet yielded to constraint; and as it is not credible that Solomon was so
blind as to suppose that idols should be worshipped, but was drawn over to such sacrilege
by the blandishments of women; so we cannot believe that Adam was deceived, and supposed
the devil’s word to be truth, and therefore transgressed God’s law, but that he by the drawings
of kindred yielded to the woman, the husband to the wife, the one human being to the only
other human being. For not without significance did the apostle say, “And Adam was not
deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression;”726 but he speaks thus,
because the woman accepted as true what the serpent told her, but the man could not bear
to be severed from his only companion, even though this involved a partnership in sin. He
was not on this account less culpable, but sinned with his eyes open. And so the apostle
does not say, “He did not sin,” but “He was not deceived.” For he shows that he sinned
when he says, “By one man sin entered into the world,”727 and immediately after more

distinctly, “In the likeness of Adam’s transgression.” But he meant that those are deceived
who do not judge that which they do to be sin; but he knew. Otherwise how were it true
“Adam was not deceived?” But having as yet no experience of the divine severity, he was
possibly deceived in so far as he thought his sin venial. And consequently he was not deceived
as the woman was deceived, but he was deceived as to the judgment which would be passed
on his apology: “The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me, and I did
eat.”728 What need of saying more? Although they were not both deceived by credulity,
yet both were entangled in the snares of the devil, and taken by sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Of the Nature of Man’s First Sin.</head>
<p>If any one finds a difficulty in understanding why other sins do not alter human nature
as it was altered by the transgression of those first human beings, so that on account of it
this nature is subject to the great corruption we feel and see, and to death, and is distracted
and tossed with so many furious and contending emotions, and is certainly far different
from what it was before sin, even though it were then lodged in an animal body,—if, I say,
any one is moved by this, he ought not to think that that sin was a small and light one because
it was committed about food, and that not bad nor noxious, except because it was forbidden;
for in that spot of singular felicity God could not have created and planted any evil thing.
But by the precept He gave, God commended obedience, which is, in a sort, the mother and
guardian of all the virtues in the reasonable creature, which was so created that submission
is advantageous to it, while the fulfillment of its own will in preference to the Creator’s is
destruction. And as this commandment enjoining abstinence from one kind of food in the
midst of great abundance of other kinds was so easy to keep,—so light a burden to the
memory,—and, above all, found no resistance to its observance in lust, which only afterwards
sprung up as the penal consequence of sin, the iniquity of violating it was all the greater in
proportion to the ease with which it might have been kept.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="628"/>
<head>Chapter 13.—That in Adam’s Sin an Evil Will Preceded the Evil Act.</head>
<p>Our first parents fell into open disobedience because already they were secretly corrupted;
for the evil act had never been done had not an evil will preceded it. And what is the origin
of our evil will but pride? For “pride is the beginning of sin.”729 And what is pride but the
craving for undue exaltation? And this is undue exaltation, when the soul abandons Him
to whom it ought to cleave as its end, and becomes a kind of end to itself. This happens
when it becomes its own satisfaction. And it does so when it falls away from that unchangeable
good which ought to satisfy it more than itself. This falling away is spontaneous; for if
the will had remained steadfast in the love of that higher and changeless good by which it
was illumined to intelligence and kindled into love, it would not have turned away to find
satisfaction in itself, and so become frigid and benighted; the woman would not have believed
the serpent spoke the truth, nor would the man have preferred the request of his wife to the
command of God, nor have supposed that it was a venial trangression to cleave to the partner
of his life even in a partnership of sin. The wicked deed, then,—that is to say, the trangression
of eating the forbidden fruit,—was committed by persons who were already wicked. That
“evil fruit”730 could be brought forth only by “a corrupt tree.” But that the tree was evil was
not the result of nature; for certainly it could become so only by the vice of the will, and vice
is contrary to nature. Now, nature could not have been depraved by vice had it not been
made out of nothing. Consequently, that it is a nature, this is because it is made by God;
but that it falls away from Him, this is because it is made out of nothing. But man did not
so fall away731 as to become absolutely nothing; but being turned towards himself, his being
became more contracted than it was when he clave to Him who supremely is. Accordingly,
to exist in himself, that is, to be his own satisfaction after abandoning God, is not quite to
become a nonentity, but to approximate to that. And therefore the holy Scriptures designate
the proud by another name, “self-pleasers.” For it is good to have the heart lifted up, yet
not to one’s self, for this is proud, but to the Lord, for this is obedient, and can be the act
only of the humble. There is, therefore, something in humility which, strangely enough,
exalts the heart, and something in pride which debases it. This seems, indeed, to be contradictory,
that loftiness should debase and lowliness exalt. But pious humility enables us to
submit to what is above us; and nothing is more exalted above us than God; and therefore
humility, by making us subject to God, exalts us. But pride, being a defect of nature, by the
very act of refusing subjection and revolting from Him who is supreme, falls to a low condition;
and then comes to pass what is written: “Thou castedst them down when they lifted
<note type="footnote">729 Ecclus. x. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">730 Matt. vii. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">731 Defecit.</note>

<pb n="629"/>
up themselves.”732 For he does not say, “when they had been lifted up,” as if first they were
exalted, and then afterwards cast down; but “when they lifted up themselves” even then they
were cast down,—that is to say, the very lifting up was already a fall. And therefore it is that
humility is specially recommended to the city of God as it sojourns in this world, and is
specially exhibited in the city of God, and in the person of Christ its King; while the contrary
vice of pride, according to the testimony of the sacred writings, specially rules his adversary
the devil. And certainly this is the great difference which distinguishes the two cities of
which we speak, the one being the society of the godly men, the other of the ungodly, each
associated with the angels that adhere to their party, and the one guided and fashioned by
love of self, the other by love of God.</p>
<p>The devil, then, would not have ensnared man in the open and manifest sin of doing
what God had forbidden, had man not already begun to live for himself. It was this that
made him listen with pleasure to the words, “Ye shall be as gods,”733 which they would
much more readily have accomplished by obediently adhering to their supreme and true
end than by proudly living to themselves. For created gods are gods not by virtue of what
is in themselves, but by a participation of the true God. By craving to be more, man becomes
less; and by aspiring to be self-sufficing, he fell away from Him who truly suffices him.
Accordingly, this wicked desire which prompts man to please himself as if he were himself
light, and which thus turns him away from that light by which, had he followed it, he would
himself have become light,—this wicked desire, I say, already secretly existed in him, and
the open sin was but its consequence. For that is true which is written, “Pride goeth before
destruction, and before honor is humility;”734 that is to say, secret ruin precedes open ruin,
while the former is not counted ruin. For who counts exaltation ruin, though no sooner is
the Highest forsaken than a fall is begun? But who does not recognize it as ruin, when there
occurs an evident and indubitable transgression of the commandment? And consequently,
God’s prohibition had reference to such an act as, when committed, could not be defended
on any pretense of doing what was righteous.735 And I make bold to say that it is useful for
the proud to fall into an open and indisputable transgression, and so displease themselves,
as already, by pleasing themselves, they had fallen. For Peter was in a healthier condition
when he wept and was dissatisfied with himself, than when he boldly presumed and satisfied
himself. And this is averred by the sacred Psalmist when he says, “Fill their faces with shame,
that they may seek Thy name, O Lord;”736 that is, that they who have pleased themselves
in seeking their own glory may be pleased and satisfied with Thee in seeking Thy glory.</p>

beguiled me, and I did eat;” and the man said, “The woman whom Thou gavest to be with
me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.”737 Here there is no word of begging pardon, no
word of entreaty for healing. For though they do not, like Cain, deny that they have perpetrated
the deed, yet their pride seeks to refer its wickedness to another,—the woman’s pride
to the serpent, the man’s to the woman. But where there is a plain trangression of a divine
commandment, this is rather to accuse than to excuse oneself. For the fact that the woman
sinned on the serpent’s persuasion, and the man at the woman’s offer, did not make the
transgression less, as if there were any one whom we ought rather to believe or yield to than

had placed him in Paradise; who had enriched him with abundance of every kind and of
safety; who had laid upon him neither many, nor great, nor difficult commandments, but,
in order to make a wholesome obedience easy to him, had given him a single very brief and
very light precept by which He reminded that creature whose service was to be free that He
was Lord,—it was just that condemnation followed, and condemnation such that man, who
by keeping the commandments should have been spiritual even in his flesh, became fleshly
even in his spirit; and as in his pride he had sought to be his own satisfaction, God in His
justice abandoned him to himself, not to live in the absolute independence he affected, but
instead of the liberty he desired, to live dissatisfied with himself in a hard and miserable
bondage to him to whom by sinning he had yielded himself, doomed in spite of himself to
die in body as he had willingly become dead in spirit, condemned even to eternal death (had
not the grace of God delivered him) because he had forsaken eternal life. Whoever thinks
such punishment either excessive or unjust shows his inability to measure the great iniquity
of sinning where sin might so easily have been avoided. For as Abraham’s obedience is with
justice pronounced to be great, because the thing commanded, to kill his son, was very difficult,
so in Paradise the disobedience was the greater, because the difficulty of that which
was commanded was imperceptible. And as the obedience of the second Man was the more
laudable because He became obedient even “unto death,”738 so the disobedience of the first
man was the more detestable because he became disobedient even unto death. For where
the penalty annexed to disobedience is great, and the thing commanded by the Creator is
easy, who can sufficiently estimate how great a wickedness it is, in a matter so easy, not to
obey the authority of so great a power, even when that power deters with so terrible a penalty?</p>
<p>In short, to say all in a word, what but disobedience was the punishment of disobedience
in that sin? For what else is man’s misery but his own disobedience to himself, so that
in consequence of his not being willing to do what he could do, he now wills to do what
he cannot? For though he could not do all things in Paradise before he sinned, yet he
wished to do only what he could do, and therefore he could do all things he wished.
But now, as we recognize in his offspring, and as divine Scripture testifies, “Man is like
to vanity.”739 For who can count how many things he wishes which he cannot do, so

<pb n="632"/>
long as he is disobedient to himself, that is, so long as his mind and his flesh do not obey
his will? For in spite of himself his mind is both frequently disturbed, and his flesh
suffers, and grows old, and dies; and in spite of ourselves we suffer whatever else we
suffer, and which we would not suffer if our nature absolutely and in all its parts obeyed
our will. But is it not the infirmities of the flesh which hamper it in its service? Yet
what does it matter how its service is hampered, so long as the fact remains, that by the
just retribution of the sovereign God whom we refused to be subject to and serve, our
flesh, which was subjected to us, now torments us by insubordination, although our
disobedience brought trouble on ourselves, not upon God? For He is not in need of
our service as we of our body’s; and therefore what we did was no punishment to Him,
but what we receive is so to us. And the pains which are called bodily are pains of the
soul in and from the body. For what pain or desire can the flesh feel by itself and without
the soul? But when the flesh is said to desire or to suffer, it is meant, as we have explained,
that the man does so, or some part of the soul which is affected by the sensation
of the flesh, whether a harsh sensation causing pain, or gentle, causing pleasure. But
pain in the flesh is only a discomfort of the soul arising from the flesh, and a kind of
shrinking from its suffering, as the pain of the soul which is called sadness is a shrinking
from those things which have happened to us in spite of ourselves. But sadness is frequently
preceded by fear, which is itself in the soul, not in the flesh; while bodily pain
is not preceded by any kind of fear of the flesh, which can be felt in the flesh before the
pain. But pleasure is preceded by a certain appetite which is felt in the flesh like a
craving, as hunger and thirst and that generative appetite which is most commonly
identified with the name” lust,” though this is the generic word for all desires. For anger
itself was defined by the ancients as nothing else than the lust of revenge;740 although
sometimes a man is angry even at inanimate objects which cannot feel his vengeance,
as when one breaks a pen, or crushes a quill that writes badly. Yet even this, though
less reasonable, is in its way a lust of revenge, and is, so to speak, a mysterious kind of
shadow of [the great law of] retribution, that they who do evil should suffer evil. There
is therefore a lust for revenge, which is called anger; there is a lust of money, which goes
by the name of avarice; there is a lust of conquering, no matter by what means, which
is called opinionativeness; there is a lust of applause, which is named boasting. There
are many and various lusts, of which some have names of their own, while others have
not. For who could readily give a name to the lust of ruling, which yet has a powerful
influence in the soul of tyrants, as civil wars bear witness?</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Of the Evil of Lust,—A Word Which, Though Applicable to Many
Vices, is Specially Appropriated to Sexual Uncleanness.</head>
<p>Although, therefore, lust may have many objects, yet when no object is specified, the
word lust usually suggests to the mind the lustful excitement of the organs of generation.
And this lust not only takes possession of the whole body and outward members, but also
makes itself felt within, and moves the whole man with a passion in which mental emotion
is mingled with bodily appetite, so that the pleasure which results is the greatest of all bodily
pleasures. So possessing indeed is this pleasure, that at the moment of time in which it is
consummated, all mental activity is suspended. What friend of wisdom and holy joys, who,
being married, but knowing, as the apostle says, “how to possess his vessel in santification
and honor, not in the disease of desire, as the Gentiles who know not God,”741 would not
prefer, if this were possi ble, to beget children without this lust, so that in this function of
begetting offspring the members created for this purpose should not be stimulated by the
heat of lust, but should be actuated by his volition, in the same way as his other members
serve him for their respective ends? But even those who delight in this pleasure are not
moved to it at their own will, whether they confine themselves to lawful or transgress to
unlawful pleasures; but sometimes this lust importunes them in spite of themselves, and
sometimes fails them when they desire to feel it, so that though lust rages in the mind, it
stirs not in the body. Thus, strangely enough, this emotion not only fails to obey the legitimate
desire to beget offspring, but also refuses to serve lascivious lust; and though it often
opposes its whole combined energy to the soul that resists it, sometimes also it is divided
against itself, and while it moves the soul, leaves the body unmoved.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Of the Nakedness of Our First Parents, Which They Saw After Their
Base and Shameful Sin.</head>
<p>Justly is shame very specially connected with this lust; justly, too, these members
themselves, being moved and restrained not at our will, but by a certain independent autocracy,
so to speak, are called “shameful.” Their condition was different before sin. For as
it is written, “They were naked and were not ashamed,”742—not that their nakedness was
unknown to them, but because nakedness was not yet shameful, because not yet did lust
move those members without the will’s consent; not yet did the flesh by its disobedience
testify against the disobedience of man. For they were not created blind, as the unenlightened
vulgar fancy;743 for Adam saw the animals to whom he gave names, and of Eve we read,
“The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes.”744
Their eyes, therefore were open, but were not open to this, that is to say, were not observant
so as to recognize what was conferred upon them by the garment of grace, for they had no
consciousness of their members warring against their will. But when they were stripped of
this grace,745 that their disobedience might be punished by fit retribution, there began in
the movement of their bodily members a shameless novelty which made nakedness indecent:
it at once made them observant and made them ashamed. And therefore, after they violated
God’s command by open transgression, it is written: “And the eyes of them both were
opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
themselves aprons.”746 “The eyes of them both were opened,” not to see, for already they
saw, but to discern between the good they had lost and the evil into which they had fallen.
And therefore also the tree itself which they were forbidden to touch was called the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil from this circumstance, that if they ate of it it would impart
to them this knowledge. For the discomfort of sickness reveals the pleasure of health. “They
knew,” therefore, “that they were naked,”—naked of that grace which prevented them from
being ashamed of bodily nakedness while the law of sin offered no resistance to their mind.
And thus they obtained a knowledge which they would have lived in blissful ignorance of,
had they, in trustful obedience to God, declined to commit that offence which involved
them in the experience of the hurtful effects of unfaithfulness and disobedience. And

therefore, being ashamed of the disobedience of their own flesh, which witnessed to their
disobedience while it punished it, “they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons,” that is, cinctures for their privy parts; for some interpreters have rendered the word
by succinctoria. Campestria is, indeed, a Latin word, but it is used of the drawers or aprons
used for a similar purpose by the young men who stripped for exercise in the campus; hence
those who were so girt were commonly called campestrati. Shame modestly covered that
which lust disobediently moved in opposition to the will, which was thus punished for its
own disobedience. Consequently all nations, being propagated from that one stock, have
so strong an instinct to cover the shameful parts, that some barbarians do not uncover them
even in the bath, but wash with their drawers on. In the dark solitudes of India also, though
some philosophers go naked, and are therefore called gymnosophists, yet they make an exception
in the case of these members and cover them.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—Of the Shame Which Attends All Sexual Intercourse.</head>
<p>Lust requires for its consummation darkness and secrecy; and this not only when un
lawful intercourse is desired, but even such fornication as the earthly city has legalized.
Where there is no fear of punishment, these permitted pleasures still shrink from the public
eye. Even where provision is made for this lust, secrecy also is provided; and while lust
found it easy to remove the prohibitions of law, shamelessness found it impossible to lay
aside the veil of retirement. For even shameless men call this shameful; and though they
love the pleasure, dare not display it. What! does not even conjugal intercourse, sanctioned
as it is by law for the propagation of children, legitimate and honorable though it be, does
it not seek retirement from every eye? Before the bridegroom fondles his bride, does he not
exclude the attendants, and even the paranymphs, and such friends as the closest ties have
admitted to the bridal chamber? The greatest master of Roman eloquence says, that all right
actions wish to be set in the light, i.e., desire to be known. This right action, however, has
such a desire to be known, that yet it blushes to be seen. Who does not know what passes
between husband and wife that children may be born? Is it not for this purpose that wives
are married with such ceremony? And yet, when this well-understood act is gone about for
the procreation of children, not even the children themselves, who may already have been
born to them, are suffered to be witnesses. This right action seeks the light, in so far as it
seeks to be known, but yet dreads being seen. And why so, if not because that which is by
nature fitting and decent is so done as to be accompanied with a shame-begetting penalty
of sin?</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—That It is Now Necessary, as It Was Not Before Man Sinned, to Bridle
Anger and Lust by the Restraining Influence of Wisdom.</head>
<p>Hence it is that even the philosophers who have approximated to the truth have avowed
that anger and lust are vicious mental emotions, because, even when exercised towards objects
which wisdom does not prohibit, they are moved in an ungoverned and inordinate manner,
and consequently need the regulation of mind and reason. And they assert that this third
part of the mind is posted as it were in a kind of citadel, to give rule to these other parts, so
that, while it rules and they serve, man’s righteousness is preserved without a breach.747
These parts, then, which they acknowledge to be vicious even in a wise and temperate man,
so that the mind, by its composing and restraining influence, must bridle and recall them
from those objects towards which they are unlawfully moved, and give them access to those
which the law of wisdom sanctions,—that anger, e.g., may be allowed for the enforcement
of a just authority, and lust for the duty of propagating offspring,—these parts, I say, were
not vicious in Paradise before sin, for they were never moved in opposition to a holy will
towards any object from which it was necessary that they should be withheld by the restraining
bridle of reason. For though now they are moved in this way, and are regulated by a
bridling and restraining power, which those who live temperately, justly, and godly exercise,
sometimes with ease, and sometimes with greater difficulty, this is not the sound health of
nature, but the weakness which results from sin. And how is it that shame does not hide
the acts and words dictated by anger or other emotions, as it covers the motions of lust,
unless because the members of the body which we employ for accomplishing them are
moved, not by the emotions themselves, but by the authority of the consenting will? For
he who in his anger rails at or even strikes some one, could not do so were not his tongue
and hand moved by the authority of the will, as also they are moved when there is no anger.
But the organs of generation are so subjected to the rule of lust, that they have no motion
but what it communicates. It is this we are ashamed of; it is this which blushingly hides
from the eyes of onlookers. And rather will a man endure a crowd of witnesses when he is
unjustly venting his anger on some one, than the eye of one man when he innocently copulates
with his wife.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Of the Foolish Beastliness of the Cynics.</head>
<p>It is this which those canine or cynic748 philosophers have overlooked, when they have,
in violation of the modest instincts of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and
shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs, viz., that as the matrimonial act is legitimate, no
one should be ashamed to perform it openly, in the street or in any public place. Instinctive
shame has overborne this wild fancy. For though it is related749 that Diogenes once dared
to put his opinion in practice, under the impression that his sect would be all the more
famous if his egregious shamelessness were deeply graven in the memory of mankind, yet
this example was not afterwards followed. Shame had more influence with them, to make
them blush before men, than error to make them affect a resemblance to dogs. And possibly,
even in the case of Diogenes, and those who did imitate him, there was but an appearance
and pretence of copulation, and not the reality. Even at this day there are still Cynic philosophers
to be seen; for these are Cynics who are not content with being clad in the pallium,
but also carry a club; yet no one of them dares to do this that we speak of. If they did, they
would be spat upon, not to say stoned, by the mob. Human nature, then, is without doubt
ashamed of this lust; and justly so, for the insubordination of these members, and their defiance
of the will, are the clear testimony of the punishment of man’s first sin. And it was
fitting that this should appear specially in those parts by which is generated that nature
which has been altered for the worse by that first and great sin,—that sin from whose evil
connection no one can escape, unless God’s grace expiate in him individually that which
was perpetrated to the destruction of all in common, when all were in one man, and which
was avenged by God’s justice.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—That Man’s Transgression Did Not Annul the Blessing of Fecundity
Pronounced Upon Man Before He Sinned But Infected It with the Disease of
Lust.</head>
<p>Far be it, then, from us to suppose that our first parents in Paradise felt that lust which
caused them afterwards to blush and hide their nakedness, or that by its means they should
have fulfilled the benediction of God, “Increase and multiply and replenish the earth;”750
for it was after sin that lust began. It was after sin that our nature, having lost the power it
had over the whole body, but not having lost all shame, perceived, noticed, blushed at, and
covered it. But that blessing upon marriage, which encouraged them to increase and multiply
and replenish the earth, though it continued even after they had sinned, was yet given before
they sinned, in order that the procreation of children might be recognized as part of the
glory of marriage, and not of the punishment of sin. But now, men being ignorant of the
blessedness of Paradise, suppose that children could not have been begotten there in any
other way than they know them to be begotten now, i.e., by lust, at which even honorable
marriage blushes; some not simply rejecting, but sceptically deriding the divine Scriptures,
in which we read that our first parents, after they sinned, were ashamed of their nakedness,
and covered it; while others, though they accept and honor Scripture, yet conceive that this
expression, “Increase and multiply,” refers not to carnal fecundity, because a similar expression
is used of the soul in the words, “Thou wilt multiply me with strength in my soul;”751
and so, too, in the words which follow in Genesis, “And replenish the earth, and subdue it,”
they understand by the earth the body which the soul fills with its presence, and which it
rules over when it is multiplied in strength. And they hold that children could no more
then than now be begotten without lust, which, after sin, was kindled, observed, blushed
for, and covered; and even that children would not have been born in Paradise, but only
outside of it, as in fact it turned out. For it was after they were expelled from it that they
came together to beget children, and begot them.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Of the Conjugal Union as It Was Originally Instituted and Blessed by
God.</head>
<p>But we, for our part, have no manner of doubt that to increase and multiply and replenish
the earth in virtue of the blessing of God, is a gift of marriage as God instituted it from the
beginning before man sinned, when He created them male and female,—in other words,
two sexes manifestly distinct. And it was this work of God on which His blessing was pronounced.
For no sooner had Scripture said, “Male and female created He them,”752 than
it immediately continues, “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Increase, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it,” etc. And though all these things may not
unsuitably be interpreted in a spiritual sense, yet “male and female” cannot be understood
of two things in one man, as if there were in him one thing which rules, another which is
ruled; but it is quite clear that they were created male and female, with bodies of different
sexes, for the very purpose of begetting offspring, and so increasing, multiplying, and replenishing
the earth; and it is great folly to oppose so plain a fact. It was not of the spirit which
commands and the body which obeys, nor of the rational soul which rules and the irrational
desire which is ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme and the active which
is subject, nor of the understanding of the mind and the sense of the body, but plainly of
the matrimonial union by which the sexes are mutually bound together, that our Lord, when
asked whether it were lawful for any cause to put away one’s wife (for on account of the
hardness of the hearts of the Israelites Moses permitted a bill of divorcement to be given),
answered and said, “Have ye not read that He which made them at the beginning made
them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and
shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain,
but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”753 It
is certain, then, that from the first men were created, as we see and know them to be now,
of two sexes, male and female, and that they are called one, either on account of the matrimonial
union, or on account of the origin of the woman, who was created from the side of
the man. And it is by this original example, which God Himself instituted, that the apostle
admonishes all husbands to love their own wives in particular.754</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Whether Generation Should Have Taken Place Even in Paradise Had
Man Not Sinned, or Whether There Should Have Been Any Contention There
Between Chastity and Lust.</head>
<p>But he who says that there should have been neither copulation nor generation but for
sin, virtually says that man’s sin was necessary to complete the number of the saints. For if
these two by not sinning should have continued to live alone, because, as is supposed, they
could not have begotten children had they not sinned, then certainly sin was necessary in
order that there might be not only two but many righteous men. And if this cannot be
maintained without absurdity, we must rather believe that the number of the saints fit to
complete this most blessed city would have been as great though no one had sinned, as it is
now that the grace of God gathers its citizens out of the multitude of sinners, so long as the
children of this world generate and are generated.755</p>
<p>And therefore that marriage, worthy of the happiness of Paradise, should have had desirable
fruit without the shame of lust, had there been no sin. But how that could be, there
is now no example to teach us. Nevertheless, it ought not to seem incredible that one
member might serve the will without lust then, since so many serve it now. Do we now
move our feet and hands when we will to do the things we would by means of these members?
do we meet with no resistance in them, but perceive that they are ready servants of the will,
both in our own case and in that of others, and especially of artisans employed in mechanical
operations, by which the weakness and clumsiness of nature become, through industrious
exercise, wonderfully dexterous? and shall we not believe that, like as all those members
obediently serve the will, so also should the members have discharged the function of generation,
though lust, the award of disobedience, had been awanting? Did not Cicero, in
discussing the difference of governments in his De Republica, adopt a simile from human
nature, and say that we command our bodily members as children, they are so obedient;
but that the vicious parts of the soul must be treated as slaves, and be coerced with a more
stringent authority? And no doubt, in the order of nature, the soul is more excellent than
the body; and yet the soul commands the body more easily than itself. Nevertheless this
lust, of which we at present speak, is the more shameful on this account, because the soul
is therein neither master of itself, so as not to lust at all, nor of the body, so as to keep the
members under the control of the will; for if they were thus ruled, there should be no shame.
But now the soul is ashamed that the body, which by nature is inferior and subject to it,
should resist its authority. For in the resistance experienced by the soul in the other emotions
there is less shame, because the resistance is from itself, and thus, when it is conquered by
itself, itself is the conqueror, although the conquest is inordinate and vicious, because accomplished
by those parts of the soul which ought to be subject to reason, yet, being accom-
<note type="footnote">755 Luke xx. 34.</note>

<pb n="642"/>
plished by its own parts and energies, the conquest is, as I say, its own. For when the soul
conquers itself to a due subordination, so that its unreasonable motions are controlled by
reason, while it again is subject to God, this is a conquest virtuous and praiseworthy. Yet
there is less shame when the soul is resisted by its own vicious parts than when its will and
order are resisted by the body, which is distinct from and inferior to it, and dependent on
it for life itself.</p>
<p>But so long as the will retains under its authority the other members, without which
the members excited by lust to resist the will cannot accomplish what they seek, chastity is
preserved, and the delight of sin foregone. And certainly, had not culpable disobedience
been visited with penal disobedience, the marriage of Paradise should have been ignorant
of this struggle and rebellion, this quarrel between will and lust, that the will may be satisfied
and lust restrained, but those members, like all the rest, should have obeyed the will. The
field of generation756 should have been sown by the organ created for this purpose, as the
earth is sown by the hand. And whereas now, as we essay to investigate this subject more
exactly, modesty hinders us, and compels us to ask pardon of chaste ears, there would have
been no cause to do so, but we could have discoursed freely, and without fear of seeming
obscene, upon all those points which occur to one who meditates on the subject. There
would not have been even words which could be called obscene, but all that might be said
of these members would have been as pure as what is said of the other parts of the body.
Whoever, then, comes to the perusal of these pages with unchaste mind, let him blame his
disposition, not his nature; let him brand the actings of his own impurity, not the words
which necessity forces us to use, and for which every pure and pious reader or hearer will
very readily pardon me, while I expose the folly of that scepticism which argues solely on
the ground of its own experience, and has no faith in anything beyond. He who is not
scandalized at the apostle’s censure of the horrible wickedness of the women who “changed
the natural use into that which is against nature,”757 will read all this without being shocked,
especially as we are not, like Paul, citing and censuring a damnable uncleanness, but are
explaining, so far as we can, human generation, while with Paul we avoid all obscenity of
language.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—That If Men Had Remained Innocent and Obedient in Paradise, the
Generative Organs Should Have Been in Subjection to the Will as the Other
Members are.</head>
<p>The man, then, would have sown the seed, and the woman received it, as need required,
the generative organs being moved by the will, not excited by lust. For we move at will not
only those members which are furnished with joints of solid bone, as the hands, feet, and
fingers, but we move also at will those which are composed of slack and soft nerves: we can
put them in motion, or stretch them out, or bend and twist them, or contract and stiffen
them, as we do with the muscles of the mouth and face. The lungs, which are the very
tenderest of the viscera except the brain, and are therefore carefully sheltered in the cavity
of the chest, yet for all purposes of inhaling and exhaling the breath, and of uttering and
modulating the voice, are obedient to the will when we breathe, exhale, speak, shout, or
sing, just as the bellows obey the smith or the organist. I will not press the fact that some
animals have a natural power to move a single spot of the skin with which their whole body
is covered, if they have felt on it anything they wish to drive off,—a power so great, that by
this shivering tremor of the skin they can not only shake off flies that have settled on them,
but even spears that have fixed in their flesh. Man, it is true, has not this power; but is this
any reason for supposing that God could not give it to such creatures as He wished to possess
it? And therefore man himself also might very well have enjoyed absolute power over his
members had he not forfeited it by his disobedience; for it was not difficult for God to form
him so that what is now moved in his body only by lust should have been moved only at
will.</p>
<p>We know, too, that some men are differently constituted from others, and have some
rare and remarkable faculty of doing with their body what other men can by no effort do,
and, indeed, scarcely believe when they hear of others doing. There are persons who can
move their ears, either one at a time, or both together. There are some who, without moving
the head, can bring the hair down upon the forehead, and move the whole scalp backwards
and forwards at pleasure. Some, by lightly pressing their stomach, bring up an incredible
quantity and variety of things they have swallowed, and produce whatever they please, quite
whole, as if out of a bag. Some so accurately mimic the voices of birds and beasts and other
men, that, unless they are seen, the difference cannot be told. Some have such command
of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at pleasure, so as to produce the effect
of singing. I myself have known a man who was accustomed to sweat whenever he wished.
It is well known that some weep when they please, and shed a flood of tears. But far more
incredible is that which some of our brethren saw quite recently. There was a presbyter

<pb n="644"/>
called Restitutus, in the parish of the Calamensian758 Church, who, as often as he pleased
(and he was asked to do this by those who desired to witness so remarkable a phenomenon),
on some one imitating the wailings of mourners, became so insensible, and lay in a state so
like death, that not only had he no feeling when they pinched and pricked him, but even
when fire was applied to him, and he was burned by it, he had no sense of pain except afterwards
from the wound. And that his body remained motionless, not by reason of his selfcommand,
but because he was insensible, was proved by the fact that he breathed no more
than a dead man; and yet he said that, when any one spoke with more than ordinary distinctness,
he heard the voice, but as if it were a long way off. Seeing, then, that even in this
mortal and miserable life the body serves some men by many remarkable movements and
moods beyond the ordinary course of nature, what reason is there for doubting that, before
man was involved by his sin in this weak and corruptible condition, his members might
have served his will for the propagation of offspring without lust? Man has been given over
to himself because he abandoned God, while he sought to be self-satisfying; and disobeying
God, he could not obey even himself. Hence it is that he is involved in the obvious misery
of being unable to live as he wishes. For if he lived as he wished, he would think himself
blessed; but he could not be so if he lived wickedly.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Of True Blessedness, Which This Present Life Cannot Enjoy.</head>
<p>However, if we look at this a little more closely, we see that no one lives as he wishes
but the blessed, and that no one is blessed but the righteous. But even the righteous himself
does not live as he wishes, until he has arrived where he cannot die, be deceived, or injured,
and until he is assured that this shall be his eternal condition. For this nature demands; and
nature is not fully and perfectly blessed till it attains what it seeks. But what man is at present
able to live as he wishes, when it is not in his power so much as to live? He wishes to live,
he is compelled to die. How, then, does he live as he wishes who does not live as long as he
wishes? or if he wishes to die, how can he live as he wishes, since he does not wish even to
live? Or if he wishes to die, not because he dislikes life, but that after death he may live
better, still he is not yet living as he wishes, but only has the prospect of so living when,
through death, he reaches that which he wishes. But admit that he lives as he wishes, because
he has done violence to himself, and forced himself not to wish what he cannot obtain, and
to wish only what he can (as Terence has it, “Since you cannot do what you will, will what
you can”759), is he therefore blessed because he is patiently wretched? For a blessed life is
possessed only by the man who loves it. If it is loved and possessed, it must necessarily be
more ardently loved than all besides; for whatever else is loved must be loved for the sake
of the blessed life. And if it is loved as it deserves to be,—and the man is not blessed who
does not love the blessed life as it deserves,—then he who so loves it cannot but wish it to
be eternal. Therefore it shall then only be blessed when it is eternal.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—That We are to Believe that in Paradise Our First Parents Begat Offspring
Without Blushing.</head>
<p>In Paradise, then, man lived as he desired so long as he desired what God had commanded.
He lived in the enjoyment of God, and was good by God’s goodness; he lived
without any want, and had it in his power so to live eternally. He had food that he might
not hunger, drink that he might not thirst, the tree of life that old age might not waste him.
There was in his body no corruption, nor seed of corruption, which could produce in him
any unpleasant sensation. He feared no inward disease, no outward accident. Soundest
health blessed his body, absolute tranquillity his soul. As in Paradise there was no excessive
heat or cold, so its inhabitants were exempt from the vicissitudes of fear and desire. No
sadness of any kind was there, nor any foolish joy; true gladness ceaselessly flowed from the
presence of God, who was loved “out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.”
760 The honest love of husband and wife made a sure harmony between them.
Body and spirit worked harmoniously together, and the commandment was kept without
labor. No languor made their leisure wearisome; no sleepiness interrupted their desire to
labor.761 In tanta facilitate rerum et felicitate hominum, absit ut suspicemur, non potuisse

feminei genitalis virile semen immitti, sicut nunc potest eadem integritate salva ex utero virginis

compels us rather to limit our discussion to the bounds set by modesty than to extend
it as our moderate faculty of discourse might suggest. For since that which I have been
speaking of was not experienced even by those who might have experienced it,—I mean our
first parents (for sin and its merited banishment from Paradise anticipated this passionless
generation on their part),—when sexual intercourse is spoken of now, it suggests to men’s
thoughts not such a placid obedience to the will as is conceivable in our first parents, but
such violent acting of lust as they themselves have experienced. And therefore modesty
shuts my mouth, although my mind conceives the matter clearly. But Almighty God, the

supreme and supremely good Creator of all natures, who aids and rewards good wills, while
He abandons and condemns the bad, and rules both, was not destitute of a plan by which
He might people His city with the fixed number of citizens which His wisdom had foreordained
even out of the condemned human race, discriminating them not now by merits,
since the whole mass was condemned as if in a vitiated root, but by grace, and showing, not
only in the case of the redeemed, but also in those who were not delivered, how much grace
He has bestowed upon them. For every one acknowledges that he has been rescued from
evil, not by deserved, but by gratuitous goodness, when he is singled out from the company
of those with whom he might justly have borne a common punishment, and is allowed to
go scathless. Why, then, should God not have created those whom He foresaw would sin,
since He was able to show in and by them both what their guilt merited, and what His grace
bestowed, and since, under His creating and disposing hand, even the perverse disorder of
the wicked could not pervert the right order of things?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Of the Angels and Men Who Sinned, and that Their Wickedness Did
Not Disturb the Order of God’s Providence.</head>
<p>The sins of men and angels do nothing to impede the “great works of the Lord which
accomplish His will.”762 For He who by His providence and omnipotence distributes to
every one his own portion, is able to make good use not only of the good, but also of the
wicked. And thus making a good use of the wicked angel, who, in punishment of his first
wicked volition, was doomed to an obduracy that prevents him now from willing any good,
why should not God have permitted him to tempt the first man, who had been created upright,
that is to say, with a good will? For he had been so constituted, that if he looked to
God for help, man’s goodness should defeat the angel’s wickedness; but if by proud selfpleasing
he abandoned God, his Creator and Sustainer, he should be conquered. If his will
remained upright, through leaning on God’s help, he should be rewarded; if it became
wicked, by forsaking God, he should be punished. But even this trusting in God’s help could
not itself be accomplished without God’s help, although man had it in his own power to
relinquish the benefits of divine grace by pleasing himself. For as it is not in our power to
live in this world without sustaining ourselves by food, while it is in our power to refuse this
nourishment and cease to live, as those do who kill themselves, so it was not in man’s power,
even in Paradise, to live as he ought without God’s help; but it was in his power to live
wickedly, though thus he should cut short his happiness, and incur very just punishment.
Since, then, God was not ignorant that man would fall, why should He not have suffered
him to be tempted by an angel who hated and envied him? It was not, indeed, that He was
unaware that he should be conquered. but because He foresaw that by the man’s seed, aided
by divine grace, this same devil himself should be conquered, to the greater glory of the
saints. All was brought about in such a manner, that neither did any future event escape
God’s foreknowledge, nor did His foreknowledge compel any one to sin, and so as to
demonstrate in the experience of the intelligent creation, human and angelic, how great a
difference there is between the private presumption of the creature and the Creator’s protection.
For who will dare to believe or say that it was not in God’s power to prevent both
angels and men from sinning? But God preferred to leave this in their power, and thus to
show both what evil could be wrought by their pride, and what good by His grace.</p>

<pb n="649"/>
<head>Chapter 28.—Of the Nature of the Two Cities, the Earthly and the Heavenly.</head>
<p>Accordingly, two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the love of self,
even to the contempt of God; the heavenly by the love of God, even to the contempt of self.
The former, in a word, glories in itself, the latter in the Lord. For the one seeks glory from
men; but the greatest glory of the other is God, the witness of conscience. The one lifts up
its head in its own glory; the other says to its God, “Thou art my glory, and the lifter up of
mine head.”763 In the one, the princes and the nations it subdues are ruled by the love of
ruling; in the other, the princes and the subjects serve one another in love, the latter obeying,
while the former take thought for all. The one delights in its own strength, represented in
the persons of its rulers; the other says to its God, “I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength.”764
And therefore the wise men of the one city, living according to man, have sought for profit
to their own bodies or souls, or both, and those who have known God “glorified Him not
as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart
was darkened; professing themselves to be wise,”—that is, glorying in their own wisdom,
and being possessed by pride,—“they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible
God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and
creeping things.” For they were either leaders or followers of the people in adoring images,
“and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.”765
But in the other city there is no human wisdom, but only godliness, which offers due worship
to the true God, and looks for its reward in the society of the saints, of holy angels as well
as holy men, “that God may be all in all.”766</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Of the Two Lines of the Human Race Which from First to Last Divide
It.</head>
<p>Of the bliss of Paradise, of Paradise itself, and of the life of our first parents there, and
of their sin and punishment, many have thought much, spoken much, written much. We
ourselves, too, have spoken of these things in the foregoing books, and have written either
what we read in the Holy Scriptures, or what we could reasonably deduce from them. And
were we to enter into a more detailed investigation of these matters, an endless number of
endless questions would arise, which would involve us in a larger work than the present
occasion admits. We cannot be expected to find room for replying to every question that
may be started by unoccupied and captious men, who are ever more ready to ask questions
than capable of understanding the answer. Yet I trust we have already done justice to these
great and difficult questions regarding the beginning of the world, or of the soul, or of the
human race itself. This race we have distributed into two parts, the one consisting of those
who live according to man, the other of those who live according to God. And these we
also mystically call the two cities, or the two communities of men, of which the one is predestined
to reign eternally with God, and the other to suffer eternal punishment with the
devil. This, however, is their end, and of it we are to speak afterwards. At present, as we
have said enough about their origin, whether among the angels, whose numbers we know
not, or in the two first human beings, it seems suitable to attempt an account of their career,
from the time when our two first parents began to propagate the race until all human generation
shall cease. For this whole time or world-age, in which the dying give place and
those who are born succeed, is the career of these two cities concerning which we treat.</p>
<p>Of these two first parents of the human race, then, Cain was the first-born, and he belonged
to the city of men; after him was born Abel, who belonged to the city of God. For
as in the individual the truth of the apostle’s statement is discerned, “that is not first which
is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual,”767 whence it
comes to pass that each man, being derived from a condemned stock, is first of all born of
Adam evil and carnal, and becomes good and spiritual only afterwards, when he is grafted
into Christ by regeneration: so was it in the human race as a whole. When these two cities
began to run their course by a series of deaths and births, the citizen of this world was the
first-born, and after him the stranger in this world, the citizen of the city of God, predestinated
by grace, elected by grace, by grace a stranger below, and by grace a citizen above. By
grace,—for so far as regards himself he is sprung from the same mass, all of which is con-

demned in its origin; but God, like a potter (for this comparison is introduced by the apostle
judiciously, and not without thought), of the same lump made one vessel to honor, another
to dishonor.768 But first the vessel to dishonor was made, and after it another to honor.
For in each individual, as I have already said, there is first of all that which is reprobate, that
from which we must begin, but in which we need not necessarily remain; afterwards is that
which is well-approved, to which we may by advancing attain, and in which, when we have
reached it we may abide. Not, indeed, that every wicked man shall be good, but that no one
will be good who was not first of all wicked; but the sooner any one becomes a good man,
the more speedily does he receive this title, and abolish the old name in the new. Accordingly,
it is recorded of Cain that he built a city,769 but Abel, being a sojourner, built none. For the
city of the saints is above, although here below it begets citizens, in whom it sojourns till
the time of its reign arrives, when it shall gather together all in the day of the resurrection;
and then shall the promised kingdom be given to them, in which they shall reign with their
Prince, the King of the ages, time without end.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Of the Children of the Flesh and the Children of the Promise.</head>
<p>There was indeed on earth, so long as it was needed, a symbol and foreshadowing image
of this city, which served the purpose of reminding men that such a city was to be rather
than of making it present; and this image was itself called the holy city, as a symbol of the
future city, though not itself the reality. Of this city which served as an image, and of that
free city it typified, Paul writes to the Galatians in these terms: “Tell me, ye that desire to
be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the
one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman. But he who was of the bond woman was
born after the flesh, but he of the free woman was by promise. Which things are an allegory:
770 for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth
to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
which now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is
free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
break forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for the desolate hath many more children than
she which hath an husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit,
even so it is now. Nevertheless, what saith the Scripture? Cast out the bond woman and
her son: for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.
And we, brethren, are not children of the bond woman, but of the free, in the liberty
wherewith Christ hath made us free.”771 This interpretation of the passage, handed down
to us with apostolic authority, shows how we ought to understand the Scriptures of the two
covenants—the old and the new. One portion of the earthly city became an image of the
heavenly city, not having a significance of its own, but signifying another city, and therefore
serving, or “being in bondage.” For it was founded not for its own sake, but to prefigure
another city; and this shadow of a city was also itself foreshadowed by another preceding
figure. For Sarah’s handmaid Agar, and her son, were an image of this image. And as the
shadows were to pass away when the full light came, Sarah, the free woman, who prefigured
the free city (which again was also prefigured in another way by that shadow of a city Jerusalem),
therefore said, “Cast out the bond woman and her son; for the son of the bond woman
shall not be heir with my son Isaac,” or, as the apostle says, “with the son of the free woman.”
In the earthly city, then, we find two things—its own obvious presence, and its symbolic
presentation of the heavenly city. Now citizens are begotten to the earthly city by nature
vitiated by sin, but to the heavenly city by grace freeing nature from sin; whence the former
are called “vessels of wrath,” the latter “vessels of mercy.”772 And this was typified in the

two sons of Abraham,—Ishmael, the son of Agar the handmaid, being born according to
the flesh, while Isaac was born of the free woman Sarah, according to the promise. Both,
indeed, were of Abraham’s seed; but the one was begotten by natural law, the other was
given by gracious promise. In the one birth, human action is revealed; in the other, a divine
kindness comes to light.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—That Sarah’s Barrenness was Made Productive by God’s Grace.</head>
<p>Sarah, in fact, was barren; and, despairing of offspring, and being resolved that she
would have at least through her handmaid that blessing she saw she could not in her own
person procure, she gave her handmaid to her husband, to whom she herself had been unable
to bear children. From him she required this conjugal duty, exercising her own right in
another’s womb. And thus Ishmael was born according to the common law of human
generation, by sexual intercourse. Therefore it is said that he was born “according to the
flesh,”—not because such births are not the gifts of God, nor His handiwork, whose creative
wisdom “reaches,” as it is written, “from one end to another mightily, and sweetly doth she
order all things,”773 but because, in a case in which the gift of God, which was not due to
men and was the gratuitous largess of grace, was to be conspicuous, it was requisite that a
son be given in a way which no effort of nature could compass. Nature denies children to
persons of the age which Abraham and Sarah had now reached; besides that, in Sarah’s case,
she was barren even in her prime. This nature, so constituted that offspring could not be
looked for, symbolized the nature of the human race vitiated by sin and by just consequence
condemned, which deserves no future felicity. Fitly, therefore, does Isaac, the child of
promise, typify the children of grace, the citizens of the free city, who dwell together in
everlasting peace, in which self-love and self-will have no place, but a ministering love that
rejoices in the common joy of all, of many hearts makes one, that is to say, secures a perfect
concord.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Of the Conflict and Peace of the Earthly City.</head>
<p>But the earthly city, which shall not be everlasting (for it will no longer be a city when
it has been committed to the extreme penalty), has its good in this world, and rejoices in it
with such joy as such things can afford. But as this is not a good which can discharge its
devotees of all distresses, this city is often divided against itself by litigations, wars, quarrels,
and such victories as are either life-destroying or short-lived. For each part of it that arms
against another part of it seeks to triumph over the nations through itself in bondage to
vice. If, when it has conquered, it is inflated with pride, its victory is life-destroying; but if
it turns its thoughts upon the common casualties of our mortal condition, and is rather
anxious concerning the disasters that may befall it than elated with the successes already
achieved, this victory, though of a higher kind, is still only short-lived; for it cannot abidingly
rule over those whom it has victoriously subjugated. But the things which this city desires
cannot justly be said to be evil, for it is itself, in its own kind, better than all other human
good. For it desires earthly peace for the sake of enjoying earthly goods, and it makes war
in order to attain to this peace; since, if it has conquered, and there remains no one to resist
it, it enjoys a peace which it had not while there were opposing parties who contested for
the enjoyment of those things which were too small to satisfy both. This peace is purchased
by toilsome wars; it is obtained by what they style a glorious victory. Now, when victory
remains with the party which had the juster cause, who hesitates to congratulate the victor,
and style it a desirable peace? These things, then, are good things, and without doubt the
gifts of God. But if they neglect the better things of the heavenly city, which are secured by
eternal victory and peace never-ending, and so inordinately covet these present good things
that they believe them to be the only desirable things, or love them better than those things
which are believed to be better,—if this be so, then it is necessary that misery follow and

<head>Chapter 5.—Of the Fratricidal Act of the Founder of the Earthly City, and the Corresponding
Crime of the Founder of Rome.</head>
<p>Thus the founder of the earthly city was a fratricide. Overcome with envy, he slew his
own brother, a citizen of the eternal city, and a sojourner on earth. So that we cannot be
surprised that this first specimen, or, as the Greeks say, archetype of crime, should, long
afterwards, find a corresponding crime at the foundation of that city which was destined to
reign over so many nations, and be the head of this earthly city of which we speak. For of
that city also, as one of their poets has mentioned, “the first walls were stained with a
brother’s blood,”774 or, as Roman history records, Remus was slain by his brother Romulus.
And thus there is no difference between the foundation of this city and of the earthly city,
unless it be that Romulus and Remus were both citizens of the earthly city. Both desired to
have the glory of founding the Roman republic, but both could not have as much glory as
if one only claimed it; for he who wished to have the glory of ruling would certainly rule
less if his power were shared by a living consort. In order, therefore, that the whole glory
might be enjoyed by one, his consort was removed; and by this crime the empire was made
larger indeed, but inferior, while otherwise it would have been less, but better. Now these
brothers, Cain and Abel, were not both animated by the same earthly desires, nor did the
murderer envy the other because he feared that, by both ruling, his own dominion would
be curtailed,—for Abel was not solicitous to rule in that city which his brother built,—he
was moved by that diabolical, envious hatred with which the evil regard the good, for no
other reason than because they are good while themselves are evil. For the possession of
goodness is by no means diminished by being shared with a partner either permanent or
temporarily assumed; on the contrary, the possession of goodness is increased in proportion
to the concord and charity of each of those who share it. In short, he who is unwilling to
share this possession cannot have it; and he who is most willing to admit others to a share
of it will have the greatest abundance to himself. The quarrel, then, between Romulus and
Remus shows how the earthly city is divided against itself; that which fell out between Cain
and Abel illustrated the hatred that subsists between the two cities, that of God and that of
men. The wicked war with the wicked; the good also war with the wicked. But with the
good, good men, or at least perfectly good men, cannot war; though, while only going on
towards perfection, they war to this extent, that every good man resists others in those points
in which he resists himself. And in each individual “the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and
the spirit against the flesh.”775 This spiritual lusting, therefore, can be at war with the carnal
lust of another man; or carnal lust may be at war with the spiritual desires of another, in
some such way as good and wicked men are at war; or, still more certainly, the carnal lusts

<p>This sickliness—that is to say, that disobedience of which we spoke in the fourteenth
book—is the punishment of the first disobedience. It is therefore not nature, but vice; and
therefore it is said to the good who are growing in grace, and living in this pilgrimage by
faith, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.”776 In like manner
it is said elsewhere, “Warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the
weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man.”777 And
in another place, “If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an
one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”778 And elsewhere,
“Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.”779 And in the Gospel, “If thy brother
shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.”780 So too
of sins which may create scandal the apostle says, “Them that sin rebuke before all, that
others also may fear.”781 For this purpose, and that we may keep that peace without which
no man can see the Lord,782 many precepts are given which carefully inculcate mutual forgiveness;
among which we may number that terrible word in which the servant is ordered
to pay his formerly remitted debt of ten thousand talents, because he did not remit to his
fellow-servant his debt of two hundred pence. To which parable the Lord Jesus added the
words, “So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive
not every one his brother.”783 It is thus the citizens of the city of God are healed while still
they sojourn in this earth and sigh for the peace of their heavenly country. The Holy Spirit,
too, works within, that the medicine externally applied may have some good result. Otherwise,
even though God Himself make use of the creatures that are subject to Him, and in
some human form address our human senses, whether we receive those impressions in sleep
or in some external appearance, still, if He does not by His own inward grace sway and act
upon the mind, no preaching of the truth is of any avail. But this God does, distinguishing
between the vessels of wrath and the vessels of mercy, by His own very secret but very just

providence. When He Himself aids the soul in His own hidden and wonderful ways, and
the sin which dwells in our members, and is, as the apostle teaches, rather the punishment
of sin, does not reign in our mortal body to obey the lusts of it, and when we no longer yield
our members as instruments of unrighteousness,784 then the soul is converted from its own
evil and selfish desires, and, God possessing it, it possesses itself in peace even in this life,
and afterwards, with perfected health and endowed with im mortality, will reign without
sin in peace everlasting.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Of the Cause of Cain’s Crime and His Obstinacy, Which Not Even the
Word of God Could Subdue.</head>
<p>But though God made use of this very mode of address which we have been endeavoring
to explain, and spoke to Cain in that form by which He was wont to accommodate Himself
to our first parents and converse with them as a companion, what good influence had it on
Cain? Did he not fulfill his wicked intention of killing his brother even after he was warned
by God’s voice? For when God had made a distinction between their sacrifices, neglecting
Cain’s, regarding Abel’s, which was doubtless intimated by some visible sign to that effect;
and when God had done so because the works of the one were evil but those of his brother
good, Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. For thus it is written: “And the Lord
said unto Cain, Why are thou wroth, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offerest
rightly, but dost not rightly distinguish, hast thou not sinned? Fret not thyself, for unto thee
shall be his turning, and thou shalt rule over him.”785 In this admonition administered by
God to Cain, that clause indeed, “If thou offerest rightly, but dost not rightly distinguish,
hast thou not sinned?” is obscure, inasmuch as it is not apparent for what reason or purpose
it was spoken, and many meanings have been put upon it, as each one who discusses it attempts
to interpret it according to the rule of faith. The truth is, that a sacrifice is “rightly
offered” when it is offered to the true God, to whom alone we must sacrifice. And it is “not
rightly distinguished” when we do not rightly distinguish the places or seasons or materials
of the offering, or the person offering, or the person to whom it is presented, or those to
whom it is distributed for food after the oblation. Distinguishing786 is here used for discriminating,—
whether when an offering is made in a place where it ought not or of a material
which ought to be offered not there but elsewhere; or when an offering is made at a wrong
time, or of a material suitable not then but at some other time; or when that is offered which
in no place nor any time ought to be offered; or when a man keeps to himself choicer specimens
of the same kind than he offers to God; or when he or any other who may not lawfully
partake profanely eats of the oblation. In which of these particulars Cain displeased God,
it is difficult to determine. But the Apostle John, speaking of these brothers, says, “Not as
Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because
his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.”787 He thus gives us to understand
that God did not respect his offering because it was not rightly “distinguished” in this, that
he gave to God something of his own but kept himself to himself. For this all do who follow
not God’s will but their own, who live not with an upright but a crooked heart, and yet offer
to God such gifts as they suppose will procure from Him that He aid them not by healing

but by gratifying their evil passions. And this is the characteristic of the earthly city, that it
worships God or gods who may aid it in reigning victoriously and peacefully on earth not
through love of doing good, but through lust of rule. The good use the world that they may
enjoy God: the wicked, on the contrary, that they may enjoy the world would fain use
God,—those of them, at least, who have attained to the belief that He is and takes an interest
in human affairs. For they who have not yet attained even to this belief are still at a much
lower level. Cain, then, when he saw that God had respect to his brother’s sacrifice, but not
to his own, should have humbly chosen his good brother as his example, and not proudly
counted him his rival. But he was wroth, and his countenance fell. This angry regret for
another person’s goodness, even his brother’s, was charged upon him by God as a great sin.
And He accused him of it in the interrogation, “Why are thou wroth, and why is thy countenance
fallen?” For God saw that he envied his brother, and of this He accused him. For
to men, from whom the heart of their fellow is hid, it might be doubtful and quite uncertain
whether that sadness bewailed his own wickedness by which, as he had learned, he had
displeased God, or his brother’s goodness, which had pleased God, and won His favorable
regard to his sacrifice. But God, in giving the reason why He refused to accept Cain’s offering
and why Cain should rather have been displeased at himself than at his brother, shows him
that though he was unjust in “not rightly distinguishing,” that is, not rightly living and being
unworthy to have his offering received, he was more unjust by far in hating his just brother
without a cause.</p>
<p>Yet He does not dismiss him without counsel, holy, just, and good. “Fret not thyself,”
He says, “for unto thee shall be his turning, and thou shall rule over him.” Over his brother,
does He mean? Most certainly not. Over what, then, but sin? For He had said, “Thou hast
sinned,” and then He added, “Fret not thyself, for to thee shall be its turning, and thou shall
rule over it.”788 And the “turning” of sin to the man can be understood of his conviction
that the guilt of sin can be laid at no other man’s door but his own. For this is the healthgiving
medicine of penitence, and the fit plea for pardon; so that, when it is said, “To thee
its turning,” we must not supply “shall be,” but we must read, “To thee let its turning be,”
understanding it as a command, not as a prediction. For then shall a man rule over his sin
when he does not prefer it to himself and defend it, but subjects it by repentance; otherwise
he that becomes protector of it shall surely become its prisoner. But if we understand this
sin to be that carnal concupiscence of which the apostle says, “The flesh lusteth against the
spirit,”789 among the fruits of which lust he names envy, by which assuredly Cain was stung
and excited to destroy his brother, then we may properly supply the words “shall be,” and
read, “To thee shall be its turning, and thou shalt rule over it.” For when the carnal part

which the apostle calls sin, in that place where he says, “It is not I who do it, but sin that
dwelleth in me,”790 that part which the philosophers also call vicious, and which ought not
to lead the mind, but which the mind ought to rule and restrain by reason from illicit motions,—
when, then, this part has been moved to perpetrate any wickedness, if it be curbed
and if it obey the word of the apostle, “Yield not your members instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin,”791 it is turned towards the mind and subdued and conquered by it, so that
reason rules over it as a subject. It was this which God enjoined on him who was kindled
with the fire of envy against his brother, so that he sought to put out of the way him whom
he should have set as an example. “Fret not thyself,” or compose thyself, He says: withhold
thy hand from crime; let not sin reign in your mortal body to fulfill it in the lusts thereof,
nor yield your members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. “For to thee shall be its
turning,” so long as you do not encourage it by giving it the rein, but bridle it by quenching
its fire. “And thou shalt rule over it;” for when it is not allowed any external actings, it yields
itself to the rule of the governing mind and righteous will, and ceases from even internal
motions. There is something similar said in the same divine book of the woman, when God
questioned and judged them after their sin, and pronounced sentence on them all,—the
devil in the form of the serpent, the woman and her husband in their own persons. For
when He had said to her, “I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow
shall thou bring forth children,” then He added, “and thy turning shall be to thy husband,
and he shall rule over thee.”792 What is said to Cain about his sin, or about the vicious
concupiscence of his flesh, is here said of the woman who had sinned; and we are to understand
that the husband is to rule his wife as the soul rules the flesh. And therefore, says the
apostle, “He that loveth his wife, loveth himself; for no man ever yet hated his own flesh.”793
This flesh, then, is to be healed, because it belongs to ourselves: is not to be abandoned to
destruction as if it were alien to our nature. But Cain received that counsel of God in the
spirit of one who did not wish to amend. In fact, the vice of envy grew stronger in him; and,
having entrapped his brother, he slew him. Such was the founder of the earthly city. He
was also a figure of the Jews who slew Christ the Shepherd of the flock of men, prefigured
by Abel the shepherd of sheep: but as this is an allegorical and prophetical matter, I forbear
to explain it now; besides, I remember that I have made some remarks upon it in writing
against Faustus the Manichæan.794</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—What Cain’s Reason Was for Building a City So Early in the History of
the Human Race.</head>
<p>At present it is the history which I aim at defending, that Scripture may not be reckoned
incredible when it relates that one man built a city at a time in which there seem to have
been but four men upon earth, or rather indeed but three, after one brother slew the other,—
to wit, the first man the father of all, and Cain himself, and his son Enoch, by whose
name the city was itself called. But they who are moved by this consideration forget to take
into account that the writer of the sacred history does not necessarily mention all the men
who might be alive at that time, but those only whom the scope of his work required him
to name. The design of that writer (who in this matter was the instrument of the Holy
Ghost) was to descend to Abraham through the successions of ascertained generations
propagated from one man, and then to pass from Abraham’s seed to the people of God, in
whom, separated as they were from other nations, was prefigured and predicted all that
relates to the city whose reign is eternal, and to its king and founder Christ, which things
were foreseen in the Spirit as destined to come; yet neither is this object so effected as that
nothing is said of the other society of men which we call the earthly city, but mention is
made of it so far as seemed needful to enhance the glory of the heavenly city by contrast to
its opposite. Accordingly, when the divine Scripture, in mentioning the number of years
which those men lived, concludes its account of each man of whom it speaks, with the words,
“And he begat sons and daughters, and all his days were so and so, and he died,” are we to
understand that, because it does not name those sons and daughters, therefore, during that
long term of years over which one lifetime extended in those early days, there might not
have been born very many men, by whose united numbers not one but several cities might
have been built? But it suited the purpose of God, by whose inspiration these histories were
composed, to arrange and distinguish from the first these two societies in their several
generations,—that on the one side the generations of men, that is to say, of those who live
according to man, and on the other side the generations of the sons of God, that is to say,
of men living according to God, might be traced down together and yet apart from one another
as far as the deluge, at which point their dissociation and association are exhibited:
their dissociation, inasmuch as the generations of both lines are recorded in separate tables,
the one line descending from the fratricide Cain, the other from Seth, who had been born
to Adam instead of him whom his brother slew; their association, inasmuch as the good so
deteriorated that the whole race became of such a character that it was swept away by the
deluge, with the exception of one just man, whose name was Noah, and his wife and three
sons and three daughters-in-law, which eight persons were alone deemed worthy to escape
from that desolating visitation which destroyed all men.</p>
<p>Therefore, although it is written, “And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare
Enoch, and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son

<pb n="665"/>
Enoch,”795 it does not follow that we are to believe this to have been his first-born; for we
cannot suppose that this is proved by the expression “he knew his wife,” as if then for the
first time he had had intercourse with her. For in the case of Adam, the father of all, this
expression is used not only when Cain, who seems to have been his first-born, was conceived,
but also afterwards the same Scripture says, “Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived,
and bare a son, and called his name Seth.”796 Whence it is obvious that Scripture employs
this expression neither always when a birth is recorded nor then only when the birth of a
first-born is mentioned. Neither is it necessary to suppose that Enoch was Cain’s first-born
because he named his city after him. For it is quite possible that though he had other sons,
yet for some reason the father loved him more than the rest. Judah was not the first-born,
though he gives his name to Judæa and the Jews. But even though Enoch was the first-born
of the city’s founder, that is no reason for supposing that the father named the city after him
as soon as he was born; for at that time he, being but a solitary man, could not have founded
a civic community, which is nothing else than a multitude of men bound together by some
associating tie. But when his family increased to such numbers that he had quite a population,
then it became possible to him both to build a city, and give it, when founded, the name of
his son. For so long was the life of those antediluvians, that he who lived the shortest time
of those whose years are mentioned in Scripture attained to the age of 753 years.797 And
though no one attained the age of a thousand years, several exceeded the age of nine hundred.
Who then can doubt that during the lifetime of one man the human race might be so multiplied
that there would be a population to build and occupy not one but several cities? And
this might very readily be conjectured from the fact that from one man, Abraham, in not
much more than four hundred years, the numbers of the Hebrew race so increased, that in
the exodus of that people from Egypt there are recorded to have been six hundred thousand
men capable of bearing arms,798 and this over and above the Idumæans, who, though not
numbered with Israel’s descendants, were yet sprung from his brother, also a grandson of
Abraham; and over and above the other nations which were of the same stock of Abraham,
though not through Sarah,—that is, his descendants by Hagar and Keturah, the Ishmaelites,
Midianites, etc.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Of the Long Life and Greater Stature of the Antediluvians.</head>
<p>Wherefore no one who considerately weighs facts will doubt that Cain might have built
a city, and that a large one, when it is observed how prolonged were the lives of men, unless
perhaps some sceptic take exception to this very length of years which our authors ascribe
to the antediluvians and deny that this is credible. And so, too, they do not believe that the
size of men’s bodies was larger then than now, though the most esteemed of their own poets,
Virgil, asserts the same, when he speaks of that huge stone which had been fixed as a landmark,
and which a strong man of those ancient times snatched up as he fought, and ran,
and hurled, and cast it,—
<lg>
<l>“Scarce twelve strong men of later mould</l>
<l>That weight could on their necks uphold.”799</l>
</lg>
thus declaring his opinion that the earth then produced mightier men. And if in the
more recent times, how much more in the ages before the world-renowned deluge? But the
large size of the primitive human body is often proved to the incredulous by the exposure
of sepulchres, either through the wear of time or the violence of torrents or some accident,
and in which bones of incredible size have been found or have rolled out. I myself, along
with some others, saw on the shore at Utica a man’s molar tooth of such a size, that if it were
cut down into teeth such as we have, a hundred, I fancy, could have been made out of it.
But that, I believe, belonged to some giant. For though the bodies of ordinary men were
then larger than ours, the giants surpassed all in stature. And neither in our own age nor
any other have there been altogether wanting instances of gigantic stature, though they may
be few. The younger Pliny, a most learned man, maintains that the older the world becomes,
the smaller will be the bodies of men.800 And he mentions that Homer in his poems often
lamented the same decline; and this he does not laugh at as a poetical figment, but in his
character of a recorder of natural wonders accepts it as historically true. But, as I said, the
bones which are from time to time discovered prove the size of the bodies of the ancients,801
and will do so to future ages, for they are slow to decay. But the length of an antediluvian’s
life cannot now be proved by any such monumental evidence. But we are not on this account
to withhold our faith from the sacred history, whose statements of past fact we are the more
inexcusable in discrediting, as we see the accuracy of its prediction of what was future. And
even that same Pliny802 tells us that there is still a nation in which men live 200 years. If,

then, in places unknown to us, men are believed to have a length of days which is quite

<head>Chapter 10.—Of the Different Computation of the Ages of the Antediluvians, Given
by the Hebrew Manuscripts and by Our Own.803</head>
<p>Wherefore, although there is a discrepancy for which I cannot account between our
manuscripts and the Hebrew, in the very number of years assigned to the antediluvians, yet
the discrepancy is not so great that they do not agree about their longevity. For the very
first man, Adam, before he begot his son Seth, is in our manuscripts found to have lived
230 years, but in the Hebrew mss. 130. But after he begot Seth, our copies read that he lived
700 years, while the Hebrew give 800. And thus, when the two periods are taken together,
the sum agrees. And so throughout the succeeding generations, the period before the father
begets a son is always made shorter by 100 years in the Hebrew, but the period after his son
is begotten is longer by 100 years in the Hebrew than in our copies. And thus, taking the
two periods together, the result is the same in both. And in the sixth generation there is no
discrepancy at all. In the seventh, however, of which Enoch is the representative, who is
recorded to have been translated without death because he pleased God, there is the same
discrepancy as in the first five generations, 100 years more being ascribed to him by our
mss. before he begat a son. But still the result agrees; for according to both documents he
lived before he was translated 365 years. In the eighth generation the discrepancy is less
than in the others, and of a different kind. For Methuselah, whom Enoch begat, lived, before
he begat his successor, not 100 years less, but 100 years more, according to the Hebrew
reading; and in our mss. again these years are added to the period after he begat his son; so
that in this case also the sum-total is the same. And it is only in the ninth generation, that
is, in the age of Lamech, Methuselah’s son and Noah’s father, that there is a discrepancy in
the sum total; and even in this case it is slight. For the Hebrew mss. represent him as living
twenty-four years more than ours assign to him. For before he begat his son, who was called
Noah, six years fewer are given to him by the Hebrew mss. than by ours; but after he begat
this son, they give him thirty years more than ours; so that, deducting the former six, there
remains, as we said, a surplus of twenty-four.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Of Methuselah’s Age, Which Seems to Extend Fourteen Years Beyond
the Deluge.</head>
<p>From this discrepancy between the Hebrew books and our own arises the well-known
question as to the age of Methuselah;804 for it is computed that he lived for fourteen years
after the deluge, though Scripture relates that of all who were then upon the earth only the
eight souls in the ark escaped destruction by the flood, and of these Methuselah was not
one. For, according to our books, Methuselah, before he begat the son whom he called
Lamech, lived 167 years; then Lamech himself, before his son Noah was born, lived 188
years, which together make 355 years. Add to these the age of Noah at the date of the deluge,
600 years, and this gives a total of 955 from the birth of Methuselah to the year of the flood.
Now all the years of the life of Methuselah are computed to be 969; for when he had lived
167 years, and had begotten his son Lamech, he then lived after this 802 years, which makes
a total, as we said, of 969 years. From this, if we deduct 955 years from the birth of Methuselah
to the flood, there remains fourteen years, which he is supposed to have lived after the
flood. And therefore some suppose that, though he was not on earth (in which it is agreed
that every living thing which could not naturally live in water perished), he was for a time
with his father, who had been translated, and that he lived there till the flood had passed
away. This hypothesis they adopt, that they may not cast a slight on the trustworthiness of
versions which the Church has received into a position of high authority,805 and because
they believe that the Jewish mss. rather than our own are in error. For they do not admit
that this is a mistake of the translators, but maintain that there is a falsified statement in the
original, from which, through the Greek, the Scripture has been translated into our own
tongue. They say that it is not credible that the seventy translators, who simultaneously and
unanimously produced one rendering, could have erred, or, in a case in which no interest
of theirs was involved, could have falsified their translation; but that the Jews, envying us
our translation of their Law and Prophets, have made alterations in their texts so as to undermine
the authority of ours. This opinion or suspicion let each man adopt according to
his own judgment. Certain it is that Methuselah did not survive the flood, but died in the
very year it occurred, if the numbers given in the Hebrew mss. are true. My own opinion
regarding the seventy translators I will, with God’s help, state more carefully in its own
place, when I have come down (following the order which this work requires) to that period
in which their translation was executed.806 For the present question, it is enough that, according
to our versions, the men of that age had lives so long as to make it quite possible

<p>For they are by no means to be listened to who suppose that in those times years were
differently reckoned, and were so short that one of our years may be supposed to be equal
to ten of theirs. So that they say, when we read or hear that some man lived 900 years, we
should understand ninety, ten of those years making but one of ours, and ten of ours equalling
100 of theirs. Consequently, as they suppose, Adam was twenty-three years of age when he
begat Seth, and Seth himself was twenty years and six months old when his son Enos was
born, though the Scripture calls these months 205 years. For, on the hypothesis of those
whose opinion we are explaining, it was customary to divide one such year as we have into
ten parts, and to call each part a year. And each of these parts was composed of six days
squared; because God finished His works in six days, that He might rest the seventh. Of
this I disputed according to my ability in the eleventh book.807 Now six squared, or six
times six, gives thirty-six days; and this multiplied by ten amounts to 360 days, or twelve
lunar months. As for the five remaining days which are needed to complete the solar year,
and for the fourth part of a day, which requires that into every fourth or leap-year a day be
added, the ancients added such days as the Romans used to call “intercalary,” in order to
complete the number of the years. So that Enos, Seth’s son, was nineteen years old when
his son Cainan was born, though Scripture calls these years 190. And so through all the
generations in which the ages of the antediluvians are given, we find in our versions that
almost no one begat a son at the age of 100 or under, or even at the age of 120 or thereabouts;
but the youngest fathers are recorded to have been 160 years old and upwards. And the
reason of this, they say, is that no one can beget children when he is ten years old, the age
spoken of by those men as 100, but that sixteen is the age of puberty, and competent now
to propagate offspring; and this is the age called by them 160. And that it may not be thought
incredible that in these days the year was differently computed from our own, they adduce
what is recorded by several writers of history, that the Egyptians had a year of four months,
the Acarnanians of six, and the Lavinians of thirteen months.808 The younger Pliny, after
mentioning that some writers reported that one man had lived 152 years, another ten more,
others 200, others 300, that some had even reached 500 and 600, and a few 800 years of age,
gave it as his opinion that all this must be ascribed to mistaken computation. For some, he
says, make summer and winter each a year; others make each season a year, like the Arcadians,
whose years, he says, were of three months. He added, too, that the Egyptians, of whose

little years of four months we have spoken already, sometimes terminated their year at the
wane of each moon; so that with them there are produced lifetimes of 1000 years.</p>
<p>By these plausible arguments certain persons, with no desire to weaken the credit of
this sacred history, but rather to facilitate belief in it by removing the difficulty of such incredible
longevity, have been themselves persuaded, and think they act wisely in persuading
others, that in these days the year was so brief that ten of their years equal but one of ours,
while ten of ours equal 100 of theirs. But there is the plainest evidence to show that this is
quite false. Before producing this evidence, however, it seems right to mention a conjecture
which is yet more plausible. From the Hebrew manuscripts we could at once refute this
confident statement; for in them Adam is found to have lived not 230 but 130 years before
he begat his third son. If, then, this mean thirteen years by our ordinary computation, then
he must have begotten his first son when he was only twelve or thereabouts. Who can at
this age beget children according to the ordinary and familiar course of nature? But not to
mention him, since it is possible he may have been able to beget his like as soon as he was
created,—for it is not credible that he was created so little as our infants are,—not to mention
him, his son was not 205 years old when he begot Enos, as our versions have it, but 105, and
consequently, according to this idea, was not eleven years old. But what shall I say of his
son Cainan, who, though by our version 170 years old, was by the Hebrew text seventy when
he beget Mahalaleel? If seventy years in those times meant only seven of our years, what
man of seven years old begets children?</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Whether, in Computing Years, We Ought to Follow the Hebrew or
the Septuagint.</head>
<p>But if I say this, I shall presently be answered, It is one of the Jews’ lies. This, however,
we have disposed of above, showing that it cannot be that men of so just a reputation as the
seventy translators should have falsified their version. However, if I ask them which of the
two is more credible, that the Jewish nation, scattered far and wide, could have unanimously
conspired to forge this lie, and so, through envying others the authority of their Scriptures,
have deprived themselves of their verity; or that seventy men, who were also themselves
Jews, shut up in one place (for Ptolemy king of Egypt had got them together for this work),
should have envied foreign nations that same truth, and by common consent inserted these
errors: who does not see which can be more naturally and readily believed? But far be it
from any prudent man to believe either that the Jews, however malicious and wrong-headed,
could have tampered with so many and so widely-dispersed manuscripts; or that those
renowned seventy individuals had any common purpose to grudge the truth to the nations.
One must therefore more plausibly maintain, that when first their labors began to be transcribed
from the copy in Ptolemy’s library, some such misstatement might find its way into
the first copy made, and from it might be disseminated far and wide; and that this might
arise from no fraud, but from a mere copyist’s error. This is a sufficiently plausible account
of the difficulty regarding Methuselah’s life, and of that other case in which there is a difference
in the total of twenty-four years. But in those cases in which there is a methodical resemblance
in the falsification, so that uniformly the one version allots to the period before
a son and successor is born 100 years more than the other, and to the period subsequent
100 years less, and vice versâ, so that the totals may agree,—and this holds true of the first,
second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh generations,—in these cases error seems to have, if
we may say so, a certain kind of constancy, and savors not of accident, but of design.</p>
<p>Accordingly, that diversity of numbers which distinguishes the Hebrew from the Greek
and Latin copies of Scripture, and which consists of a uniform addition and deduction of
100 years in each lifetime for several consecutive generations, is to be attributed neither to
the malice of the Jews nor to men so diligent and prudent as the seventy translators, but to
the error of the copyist who was first allowed to transcribe the manuscript from the library
of the above-mentioned king. For even now, in cases where numbers contribute nothing
to the easier comprehension or more satisfactory knowledge of anything, they are both
carelessly transcribed, and still more carelessly emended. For who will trouble himself to
learn how many thousand men the several tribes of Israel contained? He sees no resulting
benefit of such knowledge. Or how many men are there who are aware of the vast advantage
that lies hid in this knowledge? But in this case, in which during so many consecutive generations
100 years are added in one manuscript where they are not reckoned in the other,
and then, after the birth of the son and successor, the years which were wanting are added,

<pb n="674"/>
it is obvious that the copyist who contrived this arrangement designed to insinuate that the
antediluvians lived an excessive number of years only because each year was excessively
brief, and that he tried to draw the attention to this fact by his statement of their age of puberty
at which they became able to beget children. For, lest the incredulous might stumble
at the difficulty of so long a lifetime, he insinuated that 100 of their years equalled but ten
of ours; and this insinuation he conveyed by adding 100 years whenever he found the age
below 160 years or thereabouts, deducting these years again from the period after the son’s
birth, that the total might harmonize. By this means he intended to ascribe the generation
of offspring to a fit age, without diminishing the total sum of years ascribed to the lifetime
of the individuals. And the very fact that in the sixth generation he departed from this
uniform practice, inclines us all the rather to believe that when the circumstance we have
referred to required his alterations, he made them; seeing that when this circumstance did
not exist, he made no alteration. For in the same generation he found in the Hebrew ms.,
that Jared lived before he begat Enoch 162 years, which, according to the short year computation,
is sixteen years and somewhat less than two months, an age capable of procreation;
and therefore it was not necessary to add 100 short years, and so make the age twenty-six
years of the usual length; and of course it was not necessary to deduct, after the son’s birth,
years which he had not added before it. And thus it comes to pass that in this instance there
is no variation between the two manuscripts.</p>
<p>This is corroborated still further by the fact that in the eighth generation, while the
Hebrew books assign 182809 years to Methuselah before Lamech’s birth, ours assign to him
twenty less, though usually 100 years are added to this period; then, after Lamech’s birth,
the twenty years are restored, so as to equalize the total in the two books. For if his design
was that these 170 years be understood as seventeen, so as to suit the age of puberty, as there
was no need for him adding anything, so there was none for his subtracting anything; for
in this case he found an age fit for the generation of children, for the sake of which he was
in the habit of adding those 100 years in cases where he did not find the age already sufficient.
This difference of twenty years we might, indeed, have supposed had happened accidentally,
had he not taken care to restore them afterwards as he had deducted them from the period
before, so that there might be no deficiency in the total. Or are we perhaps to suppose that
there was the still more astute design of concealing the deliberate and uniform addition of
100 years to the first period and their deduction from the subsequent period—did he design
to conceal this by doing something similar, that is to say, adding and deducting, not indeed
a century, but some years, even in a case in which there was no need for his doing so? But
whatever may be thought of this, whether it be believed that he did so or not, whether, in

fine, it be so or not, I would have no manner of doubt that when any diversity is found in
the books, since both cannot be true to fact, we do well to believe in preference that language
out of which the translation was made into another by translators. For there are three Greek
mss., one Latin, and one Syriac, which agree with one another, and in all of these Methuselah
is said to have died six years before the deluge.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—That the Years in Those Ancient Times Were of the Same Length as
Our Own.</head>
<p>Let us now see how it can be plainly made out that in the enormously protracted lives
of those men the years were not so short that ten of their years were equal to only one of
ours, but were of as great length as our own, which are measured by the course of the sun.
It is proved by this, that Scripture states that the flood occurred in the six hundredth year
of Noah’s life. But why in the same place is it also written, “The waters of the flood were
upon the earth in the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the twentyseventh
day of the month,”810 if that very brief year (of which it took ten to make one of
ours) consisted of thirty-six days? For so scant a year, if the ancient usage dignified it with
the name of year, either has not months, or this month must be three days, so that it may
have twelve of them. How then was it here said, “In the six hundredth year, the second
month, the twenty-seventh day of the month,” unless the months then were of the same
length as the months now? For how else could it be said that the flood began on the twentyseventh
day of the second month? Then afterwards, at the end of the flood, it is thus written:
“And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, on the
mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually until the eleventh month: on
the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen.”811 But if the months were
such as we have, then so were the years. And certainly months of three days each could not
have a twenty-seventh day. Or if every measure of time was diminished in proportion, and
a thirtieth part of three days was then called a day, then that great deluge, which is recorded
to have lasted forty days and forty nights, was really over in less than four of our days. Who
can away with such foolishness and absurdity? Far be this error from us,—an error which
seeks to build up our faith in the divine Scriptures on false conjecture only to demolish our
faith at another point. It is plain that the day then was what it now is, a space of four-andtwenty
hours, determined by the lapse of day and night; the month then equal to the month
now, which is defined by the rise and completion of one moon; the year then equal to the
year now, which is completed by twelve lunar months, with the addition of five days and a
fourth to adjust it with the course of the sun. It was a year of this length which was reckoned
the six hundredth of Noah’s life, and in the second month, the twenty-seventh day of the
month, the flood began,—a flood which, as is recorded, was caused by heavy rains continuing
for forty days, which days had not only two hours and a little more, but four-and-twenty
hours, completing a night and a day. And consequently those antediluvians lived more than
900 years, which were years as long as those which afterwards Abraham lived 175 of, and
after him his son Isaac 180, and his son Jacob nearly 150, and some time after, Moses 120,

<pb n="677"/>
and men now seventy or eighty, or not much longer, of which years it is said, “their strength
is labor and sorrow.”812</p>
<p>But that discrepancy of numbers which is found to exist between our own and the
Hebrew text does not touch the longevity of the ancients; and if there is any diversity so
great that both versions cannot be true, we must take our ideas of the real facts from that
text out of which our own version has been translated. However, though any one who
pleases has it in his power to correct this version, yet it is not unimportant to observe that
no one has presumed to emend the Septuagint from the Hebrew text in the many places
where they seem to disagree. For this difference has not been reckoned a falsification; and
for my own part I am persuaded it ought not to be reckoned so. But where the difference
is not a mere copyist’s error, and where the sense is agreeable to truth and illustrative of
truth, we must believe that the divine Spirit prompted them to give a varying version, not
in their function of translators, but in the liberty of prophesying. And therefore we find
that the apostles justly sanction the Septuagint, by quoting it as well as the Hebrew when
they adduce proofs from the Scriptures. But as I have promised to treat this subject more
carefully, if God help me, in a more fitting place, I will now go on with the matter in hand.
For there can be no doubt that, the lives of men being so long, the first-born of the first man
could have built a city,—a city, however, which was earthly, and not that which is called the
city of God, to describe which we have taken in hand this great work.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Whether It is Credible that the Men of the Primitive Age Abstained
from Sexual Intercourse Until that Date at Which It is Recorded that They Begat
Children.</head>
<p>Some one, then, will say, Is it to be believed that a man who intended to beget children,
and had no intention of continence, abstained from sexual intercourse a hundred years and
more, or even, according to the Hebrew version, only a little less, say eighty, seventy, or
sixty years; or, if he did not abstain, was unable to beget offspring? This question admits of
two solutions. For either puberty was so much later as the whole life was longer, or, which
seems to me more likely, it is not the first-born sons that are here mentioned, but those
whose names were required to fill up the series until Noah was reached, from whom again
we see that the succession is continued to Abraham, and after him down to that point of
time until which it was needful to mark by pedigree the course of the most glorious city,
which sojourns as a stranger in this world, and seeks the heavenly country. That which is
undeniable is that Cain was the first who was born of man and woman. For had he not been
the first who was added by birth to the two unborn persons, Adam could not have said what
he is recorded to have said, “I have gotten a man by the Lord.”813 He was followed by Abel,
whom the elder brother slew, and who was the first to show by a kind of foreshadowing of
the sojourning city of God, what iniquitous persecutions that city would suffer at the hands
of wicked and, as it were, earth-born men, who love their earthly origin, and delight in the
earthly happiness of the earthly city. But how old Adam was when he begat these sons does
not appear. After this the generations diverge, the one branch deriving from Cain, the
other from him whom Adam begot in the room of Abel slain by his brother, and whom he
called Seth, saying, as it is written, “For God hath raised me up another seed for Abel whom
Cain slew.”814 These two series of generations accordingly, the one of Cain, the other of
Seth, represent the two cities in their distinctive ranks, the one the heavenly city, which sojourns
on earth, the other the earthly, which gapes after earthly joys, and grovels in them
as if they were the only joys. But though eight generations, including Adam, are registered
before the flood, no man of Cain’s line has his age recorded at which the son who succeeded
him was begotten. For the Spirit of God refused to mark the times before the flood in the
generations of the earthly city, but preferred to do so in the heavenly line, as if it were more
worthy of being remembered. Further, when Seth was born, the age of his father is mentioned;
but already he had begotten other sons, and who will presume to say that Cain and
Abel were the only ones previously begotten? For it does not follow that they alone had
been begotten of Adam, because they alone were named in order to continue the series of
generations which it was desirable to mention. For though the names of all the rest are
<note type="footnote">813 Gen. iv. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">814 Gen. iv. 25.</note>

<pb n="679"/>
buried in silence, yet it is said that Adam begot sons and daughters; and who that cares to
be free from the charge of temerity will dare to say how many his offspring numbered? It
was possible enough that Adam was divinely prompted to say, after Seth was born, “For
God hath raised up to me another seed for Abel,” because that son was to be capable of
representing Abel’s holiness, not because he was born first after him in point of time. Then
because it is written, “And Seth lived 205 years,” or, according to the Hebrew reading, “105
years, and begat Enos,”815 who but a rash man could affirm that this was his first-born?
Will any man do so to excite our wonder, and cause us to inquire how for so many years he
remained free from sexual intercourse, though without any purpose of continuing so, or
how, if he did not abstain, he yet had no children? Will any man do so when it is written
of him, “And he begat sons and daughters, and all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he
died?”816 And similarly regarding those whose years are afterwards mentioned, it is not
disguised that they begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>Consequently it does not at all appear whether he who is named as the son was himself
the first begotten. Nay, since it is incredible that those fathers were either so long in attaining
puberty, or could not get wives, or could not impregnate them, it is also incredible that those
sons were their first-born. But as the writer of the sacred history designed to descend by
well-marked intervals through a series of generations to the birth and life of Noah, in whose
time the flood occurred, he mentioned not those sons who were first begotten, but those by
whom the succession was handed down.</p>
<p>Let me make this clearer by here inserting an example, in regard to which no one can
have any doubt that what I am asserting is true. The evangelist Matthew, where he designs
to commit to our memories the generation of the Lord’s flesh by a series of parents, beginning
from Abraham and intending to reach David, says, “Abraham begat Isaac;”817 why did he
not say Ishmael, whom he first begat? Then “Isaac begat Jacob;” why did he not say Esau,
who was the first-born? Simply because these sons would not have helped him to reach
David. Then follows, “And Jacob begat Judah and his brethren:” was Judah the first begotten?
“Judah,” he says, “begat Pharez and Zara;” yet neither were these twins the first-born of
Judah, but before them he had begotten three other sons. And so in the order of the generations
he retained those by whom he might reach David, so as to proceed onwards to the
end he had in view. And from this we may understand that the antediluvians who are
mentioned were not the first-born, but those through whom the order of the succeeding
generations might be carried on to the patriarch Noah. We need not, therefore, weary

<head>Chapter 16.—Of Marriage Between Blood-Relations, in Regard to Which the Present
Law Could Not Bind the Men of the Earliest Ages.</head>
<p>As, therefore, the human race, subsequently to the first marriage of the man who was
made of dust, and his wife who was made out of his side, required the union of males and
females in order that it might multiply, and as there were no human beings except those
who had been born of these two, men took their sisters for wives,—an act which was as
certainly dictated by necessity in these ancient days as afterwards it was condemned by the
prohibitions of religion. For it is very reasonable and just that men, among whom concord
is honorable and useful, should be bound together by various relationships; and one man
should not himself sustain many relationships, but that the various relationships should be
distributed among several, and should thus serve to bind together the greatest number in
the same social interests. “Father” and “father-in-law” are the names of two relationships.
When, therefore, a man has one person for his father, another for his father-in-law, friendship
extends itself to a larger number. But Adam in his single person was obliged to hold both
relations to his sons and daughters, for brothers and sisters were united in marriage. So too
Eve his wife was both mother and mother-in-law to her children of both sexes; while, had
there been two women, one the mother, the other the mother-in-law, the family affection
would have had a wider field. Then the sister herself by becoming a wife sustained in her
single person two relationships, which, had they been distributed among individuals, one
being sister, and another being wife, the family tie would have embraced a greater number
of persons. But there was then no material for effecting this, since there were no human
beings but the brothers and sisters born of those two first parents. Therefore, when an
abundant population made it possible, men ought to choose for wives women who were
not already their sisters; for not only would there then be no necessity for marrying sisters,
but, were it done, it would be most abominable. For if the grandchildren of the first pair,
being now able to choose their cousins for wives, married their sisters, then it would no
longer be only two but three relationships that were held by one man, while each of these
relationships ought to have been held by a separate individual, so as to bind together by
family affection a larger number. For one man would in that case be both father, and fatherin-
law, and uncle818 to his own children (brother and sister now man and wife); and his
wife would be mother, aunt, and mother-in-law to them; and they themselves would be not
only brother and sister, and man and wife, but cousins also, being the children of brother
and sister. Now, all these relationships, which combined three men into one, would have
embraced nine persons had each relationship been held by one individual, so that a man
had one person for his sister, another his wife, another his cousin, another his father, another
his uncle, another his father-in-law, another his mother, another his aunt, another his
<note type="footnote">818 His own children being the children of his sister, and therefore his nephews.</note>

<pb n="682"/>
mother-in-law; and thus the social bond would not have been tightened to bind a few, but
loosened to embrace a larger number of relations.</p>
<p>And we see that, since the human race has increased and multiplied, this is so strictly
observed even among the profane worshippers of many and false gods, that though their
laws perversely allow a brother to marry his sister,819 yet custom, with a finer morality,
prefers to forego this license; and though it was quite allowable in the earliest ages of the
human race to marry one’s sister, it is now abhorred as a thing which no circumstances
could justify. For custom has very great power either to attract or to shock human feeling.
And in this matter, while it restrains concupiscence within due bounds, the man who neglects
and disobeys it is justly branded as abominable. For if it is iniquitous to plough beyond our
own boundaries through the greed of gain, is it not much more iniquitous to transgress the
recognized boundaries of morals through sexual lust? And with regard to marriage in the
next degree of consanguinity, marriage between cousins, we have observed that in our own
time the customary morality has prevented this from being frequent, though the law allows
it. It was not prohibited by divine law, nor as yet had human law prohibited it; nevertheless,
though legitimate, people shrank from it, because it lay so close to what was illegitimate,
and in marrying a cousin seemed almost to marry a sister,—for cousins are so closely related
that they are called brothers and sisters,820 and are almost really so. But the ancient fathers,
fearing that near relationship might gradually in the course of generations diverge, and become
distant relationship, or cease to be relationship at all, religiously endeavored to limit
it by the bond of marriage before it became distant, and thus, as it were, to call it back when
it was escaping them. And on this account, even when the world was full of people, though
they did not choose wives from among their sisters or half-sisters, yet they preferred them
to be of the same stock as themselves. But who doubts that the modern prohibition of the
marriage even of cousins is the more seemly regulation—not merely on account of the
reason we have been urging, the multiplying of relationships, so that one person might not
absorb two, which might be distributed to two persons, and so increase the number of people
bound together as a family, but also because there is in human nature I know not what
natural and praiseworthy shamefacedness which restrains us from desiring that connection
which, though for propagation, is yet lustful and which even conjugal modesty blushes over,
with any one to whom consanguinity bids us render respect?</p>
<p>The sexual intercourse of man and woman, then, is in the case of mortals a kind of seedbed
of the city; but while the earthly city needs for its population only generation, the
heavenly needs also regeneration to rid it of the taint of generation. Whether before the
deluge there was any bodily or visible sign of regeneration, such as was afterwards enjoined
<note type="footnote">819 This was allowed by the Egyptians and Athenians, never by the Romans.</note>

upon Abraham when he was circumcised, or what kind of sign it was, the sacred history
does not inform us. But it does inform us that even these earliest of mankind sacrificed to
God, as appeared also in the case of the two first brothers; Noah, too, is said to have offered
sacrifices to God when he had come forth from the ark after the deluge. And concerning
this subject we have already said in the foregoing books that the devils arrogate to themselves
divinity, and require sacrifice that they may be esteemed gods, and delight in these honors
on no other account than this, because they know that true sacrifice is due to the true God.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Of the Two Fathers and Leaders Who Sprang from One Progenitor.</head>
<p>Since, then, Adam was the father of both lines,—the father, that is to say, both of the
line which belonged to the earthly, and of that which belonged to the heavenly city,—when
Abel was slain, and by his death exhibited a marvellous mystery, there were henceforth two
lines proceeding from two fathers, Cain and Seth, and in those sons of theirs, whom it behoved
to register, the tokens of these two cities began to appear more distinctly. For Cain
begat Enoch, in whose name he built a city, an earthly one, which was not from home in
this world, but rested satisfied with its temporal peace and happiness. Cain, too, means
“possession;” wherefore at his birth either his father or mother said,” I have gotten a man
through God.” Then Enoch means “dedication;” for the earthly city is dedicated in this
world in which it is built, for in this world it finds the end towards which it aims and aspires.
Further, Seth signifies “resurrection,” and Enos his son signifies “man,” not as Adam, which
also signifies man, but is used in Hebrew indifferently for man and woman, as it is written,
“Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam,”821
leaving no room to doubt that though the woman was distinctively called Eve, yet the name
Adam, meaning man, was common to both. But Enos means man in so restricted a sense,
that Hebrew linguists tell us it cannot be applied to woman: it is the equivalent of the “child
of the resurrection,” when they neither marry nor are given in marriage.822 For there shall
be no generation in that place to which regeneration shall have brought us. Wherefore I
think it not immaterial to observe that in those generations which are propagated from him
who is called Seth, although daughters as well as sons are said to have been begotten, no
woman is expressly registered by name; but in those which sprang from Cain at the very
termination to which the line runs, the last person named as begotten is a woman. For we
read, “Methusael begat Lamech. And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the
one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father
of the shepherds that dwell in tents. And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father
of all such as handle the harp and organ. And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructor
of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.”823 Here
terminate all the generations of Cain, being eight in number, including Adam,—to wit,
seven from Adam to Lamech, who married two wives, and whose children, among whom
a woman also is named, form the eighth generation. Whereby it is elegantly signified that
the earthly city shall to its termination have carnal generations proceeding from the intercourse
of males and females. And therefore the wives themselves of the man who is the last
named father of Cain’s line, are registered in their own names,—a practice nowhere followed

before the deluge save in Eve’s case. Now as Cain, signifying possession, the founder of the
earthly city, and his son Enoch, meaning dedication, in whose name it was founded, indicate
that this city is earthly both in its beginning and in its end,—a city in which nothing more
is hoped for than can be seen in this world,—so Seth, meaning resurrection, and being the
father of generations registered apart from the others, we must consider what this sacred
history says of his son.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—The Significance of Abel, Seth, and Enos to Christ and His Body the
Church.</head>
<p>“And to Seth,” it is said, “there was born a son, and he called his name Enos: he hoped
to call on the name of the Lord God.”824 Here we have a loud testimony to the truth. Man,
then, the son of the resurrection, lives in hope: he lives in hope as long as the city of God,
which is begotten by faith in the resurrection, sojourns in this world. For in these two men,
Abel, signifying “grief,” and his brother Seth, signifying “resurrection,” the death of Christ
and His life from the dead are prefigured. And by faith in these is begotten in this world
the city of God, that is to say, the man who has hoped to call on the name of the Lord. “For
by hope,” says the apostle, “we are saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man
seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
wait for it.”825 Who can avoid referring this to a profound mystery? For did not Abel hope
to call upon the name of the Lord God when his sacrifice is mentioned in Scripture as having
been accepted by God? Did not Seth himself hope to call on the name of the Lord God, of
whom it was said, “For God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel?” Why then
is this which is found to be common to all the godly specially attributed to Enos, unless because
it was fit that in him, who is mentioned as the first-born of the father of those generations
which were separated to the better part of the heavenly city, there should be a type
of the man, or society of men, who live not according to man in contentment with earthly
felicity, but according to God in hope of everlasting felicity? And it was not said, “He hoped
in the Lord God,” nor “He called on the name of the Lord God,” but “He hoped to call on
the name of the Lord God.” And what does this “hoped to call” mean, unless it is a prophecy
that a people should arise who, according to the election of grace, would call on the name
of the Lord God? It is this which has been said by another prophet, and which the apostle
interprets of the people who belong to the grace of God: “And it shall be that whosoever
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”826 For these two expressions, “And
he called his name Enos, which means man,” and “He hoped to call on the name of the Lord
God,” are sufficient proof that man ought not to rest his hopes in himself; as it is elsewhere
written, “Cursed is the man that trusteth in man.”827 Consequently no one ought to trust
in himself that he shall become a citizen of that other city which is not dedicated in the name
of Cain’s son in this present time, that is to say, in the fleeting course of this mortal world,
but in the immortality of perpetual blessedness.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—The Significance Of Enoch’s Translation.</head>
<p>For that line also of which Seth is the father has the name “Dedication” in the seventh
generation from Adam, counting Adam. For the seventh from him is Enoch, that is, Dedication.
But this is that man who was translated because he pleased God, and who held in the
order of the generations a remarkable place, being the seventh from Adam, a number signalized
by the consecration of the Sabbath. But, counting from the diverging point of the
two lines, or from Seth, he was the sixth. Now it was on the sixth day God made man, and
consummated His works. But the translation of Enoch prefigured our deferred dedication;
for though it is indeed already accomplished in Christ our Head, who so rose again that He
shall die no more, and who was Himself also translated, yet there remains another dedication
of the whole house, of which Christ Himself is the foundation, and this dedication is deferred
till the end, when all shall rise again to die no more. And whether it is the house of God, or
the temple of God, or the city of God, that is said to be dedicated, it is all the same, and
equally in accordance with the usage of the Latin language. For Virgil himself calls the city
of widest empire “the house of Assaracus,”828 meaning the Romans, who were descended
through the Trojans from Assaracus. He also calls them the house of Æneas, because Rome
was built by those Trojans who had come to Italy under Æneas.829 For that poet imitated
the sacred writings, in which the Hebrew nation, though so numerous, is called the house
of Jacob.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—How It is that Cain’s Line Terminates in the Eighth Generation, While
Noah, Though Descended from the Same Father, Adam, is Found to Be the
Tenth from Him.</head>
<p>Some one will say, If the writer of this history intended, in enumerating the generations
from Adam through his son Seth, to descend through them to Noah, in whose time the deluge
occurred, and from him again to trace the connected generations down to Abraham, with
whom Matthew begins the pedigree of Christ the eternal King of the city of God, what did
he intend by enumerating the generations from Cain, and to what terminus did he mean
to trace them? We reply, To the deluge, by which the whole stock of the earthly city was
destroyed, but repaired by the sons of Noah. For the earthly city and community of men
who live after the flesh will never fail until the end of this world, of which our Lord says,
“The children of this world generate, and are generated.”830 But the city of God, which sojourns
in this world, is conducted by regeneration to the world to come, of which the children
neither generate nor are generated. In this world generation is common to both cities;
though even now the city of God has many thousand citizens who abstain from the act of
generation; yet the other city also has some citizens who imitate these, though erroneously.
For to that city belong also those who have erred from the faith, and introduced divers
heresies; for they live according to man, not according to God. And the Indian gymnosophists,
who are said to philosophize in the solitudes of India in a state of nudity, are its citizens;
and they abstain from marriage. For continence is not a good thing, except when it is
practised in the faith of the highest good, that is, God. Yet no one is found to have practised
it before the deluge; for indeed even Enoch himself, the seventh from Adam, who is said to
have been translated without dying, begat sons and daughters before he was translated, and
among these was Methuselah, by whom the succession of the recorded generations is
maintained.</p>
<p>Why, then, is so small a number of Cain’s generations registered, if it was proper to
trace them to the deluge, and if there was no such delay of the date of puberty as to preclude
the hope of offspring for a hundred or more years? For if the author of this book had not
in view some one to whom he might rigidly trace the series of generations, as he designed
in those which sprang from Seth’s seed to descend to Noah, and thence to start again by a
rigid order, what need was there of omitting the first-born sons for the sake of descending
to Lamech, in whose sons that line terminates,—that is to say, in the eighth generation from
Adam, or the seventh from Cain,—as if from this point he had wished to pass on to another
series, by which he might reach either the Israelitish people, among whom the earthly Jerusalem
presented a prophetic figure of the heavenly city, or to Jesus Christ, “according to the
<note type="footnote">830 Luke xx. 34.</note>

<pb n="689"/>
flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever,”831 the Maker and Ruler of the heavenly city?
What, I say, was the need of this, seeing that the whole of Cain’s posterity were destroyed
in the deluge? From this it is manifest that they are the first-born sons who are registered
in this genealogy. Why, then, are there so few of them? Their numbers in the period before
the deluge must have been greater, if the date of puberty bore no proportion to their
longevity, and they had children before they were a hundred years old. For supposing they
were on an average thirty years old when they began to beget children, then, as there are
eight generations, including Adam and Lamech’s children, 8 times 30 gives 240 years; did
they then produce no more children in all the rest of the time before the deluge? With what
intention, then, did he who wrote this record make no mention of subsequent generations?
For from Adam to the deluge there are reckoned, according to our copies of Scripture, 2262
years,832 and according to the He brew text, 1656 years. Supposing, then, the smaller
number to be the true one, and subtracting from 1656 years 240, is it credible that during
the remaining 1400 and odd years until the deluge the posterity of Cain begat no children?</p>
<p>But let any one who is moved by this call to mind that when I discussed the question,
how it is credible that those primitive men could abstain for so many years from begetting
children, two modes of solution were found,—either a puberty late in proportion to their
longevity, or that the sons registered in the genealogies were not the first-born, but those
through whom the author of the book intended to reach the point aimed at, as he intended
to reach Noah by the generations of Seth. So that, if in the generations of Cain there occurs
no one whom the writer could make it his object to reach by omitting the first-born and
inserting those who would serve such a purpose, then we must have recourse to the supposition
of late puberty, and say that only at some age beyond a hundred years they became
capable of begetting children, so that the order of the generations ran through the first-born,
and filled up even the whole period before the deluge, long though it was. It is, however,
possible that, for some more secret reason which escapes me, this city, which we say is
earthly, is exhibited in all its generations down to Lamech and his sons, and that then the
writer withholds from recording the rest which may have existed before the deluge. And
without supposing so late a puberty in these men, there might be another reason for tracing
the generations by sons who were not first-born, viz., that the same city which Cain built,
and named after his son Enoch, may have had a widely extended dominion and many kings,
not reigning simultaneously, but successively, the reigning king begetting always his successor.
Cain himself would be the first of these kings; his son Enoch, in whose name the
city in which he reigned was built, would be the second; the third Irad, whom Enoch begat;
<note type="footnote">831 Rom. ix. 5.</note>

<pb n="690"/>
the fourth Mehujael, whom Irad begat; the fifth Methusael, whom Mehujael begat; the sixth
Lamech, whom Methusael begat, and who is the seventh from Adam through Cain. But it
was not necessary that the first-born should succeed their fathers in the kingdom, but those
would succeed who were recommended by the possession of some virtue useful to the earthly
city, or who were chosen by lot, or the son who was best liked by his father would succeed
by a kind of hereditary right to the throne. And the deluge may have happened during the
lifetime and reign of Lamech, and may have destroyed him along with all other men, save
those who were in the ark. For we cannot be surprised that, during so long a period from
Adam to the deluge, and with the ages of individuals varying as they did, there should not
be an equal number of generations in both lines, but seven in Cain’s, and ten in Seth’s; for
as I have already said, Lamech is the seventh from Adam, Noah the tenth; and in Lamech’s
case not one son only is registered, as in the former instances, but more, because it was uncertain
which of them would have succeeded when he died, if there had intervened any time
to reign between his death and the deluge.</p>
<p>But in whatever manner the generations of Cain’s line are traced downwards, whether
it be by first-born sons or by the heirs to the throne, it seems to me that I must by no means
omit to notice that, when Lamech had been set down as the seventh from Adam, there were
named, in addition, as many of his children as made up this number to eleven, which is the
number signifying sin; for three sons and one daughter are added. The wives of Lamech
have another signification, different from that which I am now pressing. For at present I
am speaking of the children, and not of those by whom the children were begotten. Since,
then, the law is symbolized by the number ten,—whence that memorable Decalogue,—there
is no doubt that the number eleven, which goes beyond833 ten, symbolizes the transgression
of the law, and consequently sin. For this reason, eleven veils of goat’s skin were ordered
to be hung in the tabernacle of the testimony, which served in the wanderings of God’s
people as an ambulatory temple. And in that haircloth there was a reminder of sins, because
the goats were to be set on the left hand of the Judge; and therefore, when we confess our
sins, we prostrate ourselves in haircloth, as if we were saying what is written in the psalm,
“My sin is ever before me.”834 The progeny of Adam, then, by Cain the murderer, is completed
in the number eleven, which symbolizes sin; and this number itself is made up by a
woman, as it was by the same sex that beginning was made of sin by which we all die. And
it was committed that the pleasure of the flesh, which resists the spirit, might follow; and
so Naamah, the daughter of Lamech, means “pleasure.” But from Adam to Noah, in the
<note type="footnote">833 Transgreditur.</note>
<note type="footnote">834 Ps. li. 3.</note>

<pb n="691"/>
line of Seth, there are ten generations. And to Noah three sons are added, of whom, while
one fell into sin, two were blessed by their father; so that, if you deduct the reprobate and
add the gracious sons to the number, you get twelve,—a number signalized in the case of
the patriarchs and of the apostles, and made up of the parts of the number seven multiplied
into one another,—for three times four, or four times three, give twelve. These things being
so, I see that I must consider and mention how these two lines, which by their separate
genealogies depict the two cities, one of earth-born, the other of regenerated persons, became
afterwards so mixed and confused, that the whole human race, with the exception of eight
persons, deserved to perish in the deluge.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Why It is That, as Soon as Cain’s Son Enoch Has Been Named, the
Genealogy is Forthwith Continued as Far as the Deluge, While After the Mention
of Enos, Seth’s Son, the Narrative Returns Again to the Creation of Man.</head>
<p>We must first see why, in the enumeration of Cain’s posterity, after Enoch, in whose
name the city was built, has been first of all mentioned, the rest are at once enumerated
down to that terminus of which I have spoken, and at which that race and the whole line
was destroyed in the deluge; while, after Enos the son of Seth, has been mentioned, the rest
are not at once named down to the deluge, but a clause is inserted to the following effect:
“This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the
likeness of God made He him; male and female created He them; and blessed them, and
called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.”835 This seems to me to be
inserted for this purpose, that here again the reckoning of the times may start from Adam
himself—a purpose which the writer had not in view in speaking of the earthly city, as if
God mentioned it, but did not take account of its duration. But why does he return to this
recapitulation after mentioning the son of Seth, the man who hoped to call on the name of
the Lord God, unless because it was fit thus to present these two cities, the one beginning
with a murderer and ending in a murderer (for Lamech, too, acknowledges to his two wives
that he had committed murder), the other built up by him who hoped to call upon the name
of the Lord God? For the highest and complete terrestrial duty of the city of God, which is
a stranger in this world, is that which was exemplified in the individual who was begotten
by him who typified the resurrection of the murdered Abel. That one man is the unity of
the whole heavenly city, not yet indeed complete, but to be completed, as this prophetic
figure foreshows. The son of Cain, therefore, that is, the son of possession (and of what but
an earthly possession?), may have a name in the earthly city which was built in his name.
It is of such the Psalmist says, “They call their lands after their own names.”836 Wherefore
they incur what is written in another psalm: “Thou, O Lord, in Thy city wilt despise their
image.”837 But as for the son of Seth, the son of the resurrection, let him hope to call on
the name of the Lord God. For he prefigures that society of men which says, “But I am like
a green olive-tree in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God.”838 But let him
not seek the empty honors of a famous name upon earth, for “Blessed is the man that maketh
the name of the Lord his trust, and respecteth not vanities nor lying follies.”839 After having

presented the two cities, the one founded in the material good of this world, the other in
hope in God, but both starting from a common gate opened in Adam into this mortal state,
and both running on and running out to their proper and merited ends, Scripture begins
to reckon the times, and in this reckoning includes other generations, making a recapitulation
from Adam, out of whose condemned seed, as out of one mass handed over to merited
damnation, God made some vessels of wrath to dishonor and others vessels of mercy to
honor; in punishment rendering to the former what is due, in grace giving to the latter what
is not due: in order that by the very comparison of itself with the vessels of wrath, the
heavenly city, which sojourns on earth, may learn not to put confidence in the liberty of its
own will, but may hope to call on the name of the Lord God. For will, being a nature which
was made good by the good God, but mutable by the immutable, because it was made out
of nothing, can both decline from good to do evil, which takes place when it freely chooses,
and can also escape the evil and do good, which takes place only by divine assistance.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Of the Fall of the Sons of God Who Were Captivated by the Daughters
of Men, Whereby All, with the Exception of Eight Persons, Deservedly Perished
in the Deluge.</head>
<p>When the human race, in the exercise of this freedom of will, increased and advanced,
there arose a mixture and confusion of the two cities by their participation in a common
iniquity. And this calamity, as well as the first, was occasioned by woman, though not in
the same way; for these women were not themselves betrayed, neither did they persuade
the men to sin, but having belonged to the earthly city and society of the earthly, they had
been of corrupt manners from the first, and were loved for their bodily beauty by the sons
of God, or the citizens of the other city which sojourns in this world. Beauty is indeed a
good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to
the wicked. And thus, when the good that is great and proper to the good was abandoned
by the sons of God, they fell to a paltry good which is not peculiar to the good, but common
to the good and the evil; and when they were captivated by the daughters of men, they adopted
the manners of the earthly to win them as their brides, and forsook the godly ways
they had followed in their own holy society. And thus beauty, which is indeed God’s
handiwork, but only a temporal, carnal, and lower kind of good, is not fitly loved in preference
to God, the eternal, spiritual, and unchangeable good. When the miser prefers his gold
to justice, it is through no fault of the gold, but of the man; and so with every created thing.
For though it be good, it may be loved with an evil as well as with a good love: it is loved
rightly when it is loved ordinately; evilly, when inordinately. It is this which some one has
briefly said in these verses in praise of the Creator:840 “These are Thine, they are good, because
Thou art good who didst create them. There is in them nothing of ours, unless the
sin we commit when we forget the order of things, and instead of Thee love that which Thou
hast made.”</p>
<p>But if the Creator is truly loved, that is, if He Himself is loved and not another thing in
His stead, He cannot be evilly loved; for love itself is to be ordinately loved, because we do
well to love that which, when we love it, makes us live well and virtuously. So that it seems
to me that it is a brief but true definition of virtue to say, it is the order of love; and on this
account, in the Canticles, the bride of Christ, the city of God, sings, “Order love within
me.”841 It was the order of this love, then, this charity or attachment, which the sons of
God disturbed when they forsook God, and were enamored of the daughters of men.842
And by these two names (sons of God and daughters of men) the two cities are sufficiently
distinguished. For though the former were by nature children of men, they had come into
<note type="footnote">840 Or, according to another reading, “Which I briefly said in these verses in praise of a taper.”</note>

possession of another name by grace. For in the same Scripture in which the sons of God
are said to have loved the daughters of men, they are also called angels of God; whence many
suppose that they were not men but angels.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Whether We are to Believe that Angels, Who are of a Spiritual Substance,
Fell in Love with the Beauty of Women, and Sought Them in Marriage,
and that from This Connection Giants Were Born.</head>
<p>In the third book of this work (c. 5) we made a passing reference to this question, but
did not decide whether angels, inasmuch as they are spirits, could have bodily intercourse
with women. For it is written, “Who maketh His angels spirits,”843 that is, He makes those
who are by nature spirits His angels by appointing them to the duty of bearing His messages.
For the Greek word ἄγγελος, which in Latin appears as “angelus,” means a messenger. But
whether the Psalmist speaks of their bodies when he adds, “and His ministers a flaming
fire,” or means that God’s ministers ought to blaze with love as with a spiritual fire, is
doubtful. However, the same trustworthy Scripture testifies that angels have appeared to
men in such bodies as could not only be seen, but also touched. There is, too, a very general
rumor, which many have verified by their own experience, or which trustworthy persons
who have heard the experience of others corroborate, that sylvans and fauns, who are
commonly called “incubi,” had often made wicked assaults upon women, and satisfied their
lust upon them; and that certain devils, called Duses by the Gauls, are constantly attempting
and effecting this impurity is so generally affirmed, that it were impudent to deny it.844
From these assertions, indeed, I dare not determine whether there be some spirits embodied
in an aerial substance (for this element, even when agitated by a fan, is sensibly felt by the
body), and who are capable of lust and of mingling sensibly with women; but certainly I
could by no means believe that God’s holy angels could at that time have so fallen, nor can
I think that it is of them the Apostle Peter said, “For if God spared not the angels that sinned,
but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto
judgment.”845 I think he rather speaks of these who first apostatized from God, along with
their chief the devil, who enviously deceived the first man under the form of a serpent. But
the same holy Scripture affords the most ample testimony that even godly men have been
called angels; for of John it is written: “Behold, I send my messenger (angel) before Thy
face, who shall prepare Thy way.”846 And the prophet Malachi, by a peculiar grace specially
communicated to him, was called an angel.847</p>

<p>But some are moved by the fact that we have read that the fruit of the connection between
those who are called angels of God and the women they loved were not men like our own
breed, but giants; just as if there were not born even in our own time (as I have mentioned
above) men of much greater size than the ordinary stature. Was there not at Rome a few
years ago, when the destruction of the city now accomplished by the Goths was drawing
near, a woman, with her father and mother, who by her gigantic size over-topped all others?
Surprising crowds from all quarters came to see her, and that which struck them most was
the circumstance that neither of her parents were quite up to the tallest ordinary stature.
Giants therefore might well be born, even before the sons of God, who are also called angels
of God, formed a connection with the daughters of men, or of those living according to
men, that is to say, before the sons of Seth formed a connection with the daughters of Cain.
For thus speaks even the canonical Scripture itself in the book in which we read of this; its
words are: “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and
daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they
were fair [good]; and they took them wives of all which they chose. And the Lord God said,
My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an
hundred and twenty years. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them,
the same became the giants, men of renown.”848 These words of the divine book sufficiently
indicate that already there were giants in the earth in those days, in which the sons of God
took wives of the children of men, when they loved them because they were good, that is,
fair. For it is the custom of this Scripture to call those who are beautiful in appearance
“good.” But after this connection had been formed, then too were giants born. For the
words are: “There were giants in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons
of God came in unto the daughters of men.” Therefore there were giants both before, “in
those days,” and “also after that.” And the words, “they bare children to them,” show plainly
enough that before the sons of God fell in this fashion they begat children to God, not to
themselves,—that is to say, not moved by the lust of sexual intercourse, but discharging the
duty of propagation, intending to produce not a family to gratify their own pride, but citizens
to people the city of God; and to these they as God’s angels would bear the message, that
they should place their hope in God, like him who was born of Seth, the son of resurrection,
and who hoped to call on the name of the Lord God, in which hope they and their offspring
would be co-heirs of eternal blessings, and brethren in the family of which God is the
Father.</p>
<note type="footnote">848 Gen. vi. 1–4. Lactantius (Inst. ii. 15), Sulpicius Severus (Hist. i. 2), and others suppose from this passage
that angels had commerce with the daughters of men. See further references in the commentary of Pererius in
loc.</note>

<pb n="698"/>
<p>But that those angels were not angels in the sense of not being men, as some suppose,
Scripture itself decides, which unambiguously declares that they were men. For when it
had first been stated that “the angels of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair,
and they took them wives of all which they chose,” it was immediately added, “And the Lord
God said, My Spirit shall not always strive with these men, for that they also are flesh.” For
by the Spirit of God they had been made angels of God, and sons of God; but declining towards
lower things, they are called men, a name of nature, not of grace; and they are called
flesh, as deserters of the Spirit, and by their desertion deserted [by Him]. The Septuagint
indeed calls them both angels of God and sons of God, though all the copies do not show
this, some having only the name” sons of God.” And Aquila, whom the Jews prefer to the
other interpreters,849 has translated neither angels of God nor sons of God, but sons of
gods. But both are correct. For they were both sons of God, and thus brothers of their own
fathers, who were children of the same God; and they were sons of gods, because begotten
by gods, together with whom they themselves also were gods, according to that expression
of the psalm: “I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High.”850
For the Septuagint translators are justly believed to have received the Spirit of prophecy; so
that, if they made any alterations under His authority, and did not adhere to a strict translation,
we could not doubt that this was divinely dictated. However, the Hebrew word may
be said to be ambiguous, and to be susceptible of either translation, “sons of God,” or “sons
of gods.”</p>
<p>Let us omit, then, the fables of those scriptures which are called apocryphal, because
their obscure origin was unknown to the fathers from whom the authority of the true
Scriptures has been transmitted to us by a most certain and well-ascertained succession.
For though there is some truth in these apocryphal writings, yet they contain so many false
statements, that they have no canonical authority. We cannot deny that Enoch, the seventh
from Adam, left some divine writings, for this is asserted by the Apostle Jude in his canonical
epistle. But it is not without reason that these writings have no place in that canon of
Scripture which was preserved in the temple of the Hebrew people by the diligence of successive
priests; for their antiquity brought them under suspicion, and it was impossible to
ascertain whether these were his genuine writings, and they were not brought forward as
genuine by the persons who were found to have carefully preserved the canonical books by
a successive transmission. So that the writings which are produced under his name, and
<note type="footnote">849 Aquila lived in the time of Hadrian, to whom he is said to have been related. He was excommunicated
from the Church for the practice of astrology; and is best known by his translation of the Hebrew Scriptures
into Greek, which he executed with great care and accuracy, though he has been charged with falsifying passages
to support the Jews in their opposition to Christianity.</note>
<note type="footnote">850 Ps. lxxxii. 6.</note>

<pb n="699"/>
which contain these fables about the giants, saying that their fathers were not men, are
properly judged by prudent men to be not genuine; just as many writings are produced by
heretics under the names both of other prophets, and more recently, under the names of
the apostles, all of which, after careful examination, have been set apart from canonical authority
under the title of Apocrypha. There is therefore no doubt that, according to the
Hebrew and Christian canonical Scriptures, there were many giants before the deluge, and
that these were citizens of the earthly society of men, and that the sons of God, who were
according to the flesh the sons of Seth, sunk into this community when they forsook righteousness.
Nor need we wonder that giants should be born even from these. For all of their
children were not giants; but there were more then than in the remaining periods since the
deluge. And it pleased the Creator to produce them, that it might thus be demonstrated
that neither beauty, nor yet size and strength, are of much moment to the wise man, whose
blessedness lies in spiritual and immortal blessings, in far better and more enduring gifts,
in the good things that are the peculiar property of the good, and are not shared by good
and bad alike. It is this which another prophet confirms when he says, “These were the giants,
famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in war. Those did
not the Lord choose, neither gave He the way of knowledge unto them; but they were destroyed
because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness.”851</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—How We are to Understand This Which the Lord Said to Those Who
Were to Perish in the Flood: “Their Days Shall Be 120 Years.”</head>
<p>But that which God said, “Their days shall be a hundred and twenty years,” is not to be
understood as a prediction that henceforth men should not live longer than 120 years,—for
even after the deluge we find that they lived more than 500 years,—but we are to understand
that God said this when Noah had nearly completed his fifth century, that is, had lived 480
years, which Scripture, as it frequently uses the name of the whole of the largest part, calls
500 years. Now the deluge came in the 600th year of Noah’s life, the second month; and
thus 120 years were predicted as being the remaining span of those who were doomed,
which years being spent, they should be destroyed by the deluge. And it is not unreasonably
believed that the deluge came as it did, because already there were not found upon earth
any who were not worthy of sharing a death so manifestly judicial,—not that a good man,
who must die some time, would be a jot the worse of such a death after it was past. Nevertheless
there died in the deluge none of those mentioned in the sacred Scripture as descended
from Seth. But here is the divine account of the cause of the deluge: “The Lord God saw
that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented852 the Lord that He had made man
on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man, whom
I have created, from the face of the earth; both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and
the fowls of the air: for I am angry that I have made them.”853</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Of the Anger of God, Which Does Not Inflame His Mind, Nor Disturb
His Unchangeable Tranquillity.</head>
<p>The anger of God is not a disturbing emotion of His mind, but a judgment by which
punishment is inflicted upon sin. His thought and reconsideration also are the unchangeable
reason which changes things; for He does not, like man, repent of anything He has done,
because in all matters His decision is as inflexible as His prescience is certain. But if Scripture
were not to use such expressions as the above, it would not familiarly insinuate itself into
the minds of all classes of men, whom it seeks access to for their good, that it may alarm the
proud, arouse the careless, exercise the inquisitive, and satisfy the intelligent; and this it
could not do, did it not first stoop, and in a manner descend, to them where they lie. But
its denouncing death on all the animals of earth and air is a declaration of the vastness of
the disaster that was approaching: not that it threatens destruction to the irrational animals
as if they too had incurred it by sin.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—That the Ark Which Noah Was Ordered to Make Figures In Every
Respect Christ and the Church.</head>
<p>Moreover, inasmuch as God commanded Noah, a just man, and, as the truthful Scripture
says, a man perfect in his generation,—not indeed with the perfection of the citizens of the
city of God in that immortal condition in which they equal the angels, but in so far as they
can be perfect in their sojourn in this world,—inasmuch as God commanded him, I say, to
make an ark, in which he might be rescued from the destruction of the flood, along with
his family, i.e., his wife, sons, and daughters-in-law, and along with the animals who, in
obedience to God’s command, came to him into the ark: this is certainly a figure of the city
of God sojourning in this world; that is to say, of the church, which is rescued by the wood
on which hung the Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.854 For even its very
dimensions, in length, breadth, and height, represent the human body in which He came,
as it had been foretold. For the length of the human body, from the crown of the head to
the sole of the foot, is six times its breadth from side to side, and ten times its depth or
thickness, measuring from back to front: that is to say, if you measure a man as he lies on
his back or on his face, he is six times as long from head to foot as he is broad from side to
side, and ten times as long as he is high from the ground. And therefore the ark was made
300 cubits in length, 50 in breadth, and 30 in height. And its having a door made in the side
of it certainly signified the wound which was made when the side of the Crucified was
pierced with the spear; for by this those who come to Him enter; for thence flowed the sacraments
by which those who believe are initiated. And the fact that it was ordered to be
made of squared timbers, signifies the immoveable steadiness of the life of the saints; for
however you turn a cube, it still stands. And the other peculiarities of the ark’s construction
are signs of features of the church.</p>
<p>But we have not now time to pursue this subject; and, indeed, we have already dwelt
upon it in the work we wrote against Faustus the Manichean, who denies that there is anything
prophesied of Christ in the Hebrew books. It may be that one man’s exposition excels
another’s, and that ours is not the best; but all that is said must be referred to this city of
God we speak of, which sojourns in this wicked world as in a deluge, at least if the expositor
would not widely miss the meaning of the author. For example, the interpretation I have
given in the work against Faustus, of the words, “with lower, second, and third stories shalt
thou make it,” is, that because the church is gathered out of all nations, it is said to have two
stories, to represent the two kinds of men,—the circumcision, to wit, and the uncircumcision,
or, as the apostle otherwise calls them, Jews and Gentiles; and to have three stories, because
all the nations were replenished from the three sons of Noah. Now any one may object to
this interpretation, and may give another which harmonizes with the rule of faith. For as
<note type="footnote">854 1 Tim. ii. 5.</note>

<pb n="703"/>
the ark was to have rooms not only on the lower, but also on the upper stories, which were
called “third stories,” that there might be a habitable space on the third floor from the
basement, some one may interpret these to mean the three graces commended by the
apostle.—faith, hope, and charity. Or even more suitably they may be supposed to represent
those three harvests in the gospel, thirty-fold, sixty-fold, an hundred-fold,—chaste marriage
dwelling in the ground floor, chaste widowhood in the upper, and chaste virginity in the
top story. Or any better interpretation may be given, so long as the reference to this city is
maintained. And the same statement I would make of all the remaining particulars in this
passage which require exposition, viz., that although different explanations are given, yet
they must all agree with the one harmonious catholic faith.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Of the Ark and the Deluge, and that We Cannot Agree with Those
Who Receive the Bare History, But Reject the Allegorical Interpretation, Nor
with Those Who Maintain the Figurative and Not the Historical Meaning.</head>
<p>Yet no one ought to suppose either that these things were written for no purpose, or
that we should study only the historical truth, apart from any allegorical meanings; or, on
the contrary, that they are only allegories, and that there were no such facts at all, or that,
whether it be so or no, there is here no prophecy of the church. For what right-minded man
will contend that books so religiously preserved during thousands of years, and transmitted
by so orderly a succession, were written without an object, or that only the bare historical
facts are to be considered when we read them? For, not to mention other instances, if the
number of the animals entailed the construction of an ark of great size, where was the necessity
of sending into it two unclean and seven clean animals of each species, when both could
have been preserved in equal numbers? Or could not God, who ordered them to be preserved
in order to replenish the race, restore them in the same way He had created them?</p>
<p>But they who contend that these things never happened, but are only figures setting
forth other things, in the first place suppose that there could not be a flood so great that the
water should rise fifteen cubits above the highest mountains, because it is said that clouds
cannot rise above the top of Mount Olympus, because it reaches the sky where there is none
of that thicker atmosphere in which winds, clouds, and rains have their origin. They do not
reflect that the densest element of all, earth, can exist there; or perhaps they deny that the
top of the mountain is earth. Why, then, do these measurers and weighers of the elements
contend that earth can be raised to those aerial altitudes, and that water cannot, while they
admit that water is lighter, and liker to ascend than earth? What reason do they adduce
why earth, the heavier and lower element, has for so many ages scaled to the tranquil ether,
while water, the lighter, and more likely to ascend, is not suffered to do the same even for
a brief space of time?</p>
<p>They say, too, that the area of that ark could not contain so many kinds of animals of
both sexes, two of the unclean and seven of the clean. But they seem to me to reckon only
one area of 300 cubits long and 50 broad, and not to remember that there was another
similar in the story above, and yet another as large in the story above that again; and that
there was consequently an area of 900 cubits by 150. And if we accept what Origen855 has
with some appropriateness suggested, that Moses the man of God, being, as it is written,
“learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,”856 who delighted in geometry, may have meant
geometrical cubits, of which they say that one is equal to six of our cubits, then who does
not see what a capacity these dimensions give to the ark? For as to their objection that an
<note type="footnote">855 In his second homily on Genesis.</note>
<note type="footnote">856 Acts vii. 22.</note>

<pb n="705"/>
ark of such size could not be built, it is a very silly calumny; for they are aware that huge
cities have been built, and they should remember that the ark was an hundred years in
building. Or, perhaps, though stone can adhere to stone when cemented with nothing but
lime, so that a wall of several miles may be constructed, yet plank cannot be riveted to plank
by mortices, bolts, nails, and pitch-glue, so as to construct an ark which was not made with
curved ribs but straight timbers, which was not to be launched by its builders, but to be lifted
by the natural pressure of the water when it reached it, and which was to be preserved from
shipwreck as it floated about rather by divine oversight than by human skill.</p>
<p>As to another customary inquiry of the scrupulous about the very minute creatures, not
only such as mice and lizards, but also locusts, beetles, flies, fleas, and so forth, whether
there were not in the ark a larger number of them than was determined by God in His
command, those persons who are moved by this difficulty are to be reminded that the words
“every creeping thing of the earth” only indicate that it was not needful to preserve in the
ark the animals that can live in the water, whether the fishes that live submerged in it, or
the sea-birds that swim on its surface. Then, when it is said “male and female,” no doubt
reference is made to the repairing of the races, and consequently there was no need for those
creatures being in the ark which are born without the union of the sexes from inanimate
things, or from their corruption; or if they were in the ark, they might be there as they
commonly are in houses, not in any determinate numbers; or if it was necessary that there
should be a definite number of all those animals that cannot naturally live in the water, that
so the most sacred mystery which was being enacted might be bodied forth and perfectly
figured in actual realities, still this was not the care of Noah or his sons, but of God. For
Noah did not catch the animals and put them into the ark, but gave them entrance as they
came seeking it. For this is the force of the words, “They shall come unto thee,”857—not,
that is to say, by man’s effort, but by God’s will. But certainly we are not required to believe
that those which have no sex also came; for it is expressly and definitely said, “They shall
be male and female.” For there are some animals which are born out of corruption, but yet
afterwards they themselves copulate and produce offspring, as flies; but others, which have
no sex, like bees. Then, as to those animals which have sex, but without ability to propagate
their kind, like mules and she-mules, it is probable that they were not in the ark, but that it
was counted sufficient to preserve their parents, to wit, the horse and the ass; and this applies
to all hybrids. Yet, if it was necessary for the completeness of the mystery, they were there;
for even this species has “male and female.”</p>
<p>Another question is commonly raised regarding the food of the carnivorous animals,—
whether, without transgressing the command which fixed the number to be preserved,
there were necessarily others included in the ark for their sustenance; or, as is more probable,
<note type="footnote">857 Gen. vi. 19, 20.</note>

<pb n="706"/>
there might be some food which was not flesh, and which yet suited all. For we know how
many animals whose food is flesh eat also vegetable products and fruits, especially figs and
chestnuts. What wonder is it, therefore, if that wise and just man was instructed by God
what would suit each, so that without flesh he prepared and stored provision fit for every
species? And what is there which hunger would not make animals eat? Or what could not
be made sweet and wholesome by God, who, with a divine facility, might have enabled them
to do without food at all, had it not been requisite to the completeness of so great a mystery
that they should be fed? But none but a contentious man can suppose that there was no
prefiguring of the church in so manifold and circumstantial a detail. For the nations have
already so filled the church, and are comprehended in the framework of its unity, the clean
and unclean together, until the appointed end, that this one very manifest fulfillment leaves
no doubt how we should interpret even those others which are somewhat more obscure,
and which cannot so readily be discerned. And since this is so, if not even the most audacious
will presume to assert that these things were written without a purpose, or that though the
events really happened they mean nothing, or that they did not really happen, but are only
allegory, or that at all events they are far from having any figurative reference to the church;
if it has been made out that, on the other hand, we must rather believe that there was a wise
purpose in their being committed to memory and to writing, and that they did happen, and
have a significance, and that this significance has a prophetic reference to the church, then
this book, having served this purpose, may now be closed, that we may go on to trace in the
history subsequent to the deluge the courses of the two cities,—the earthly, that lives according
to men, and the heavenly, that lives according to God.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Whether, After the Deluge, from Noah to Abraham, Any Families Can
Be Found Who Lived According to God.</head>
<p>It is difficult to discover from Scripture, whether, after the deluge, traces of the holy city
are continuous, or are so interrupted by intervening seasons of godlessness, that not a single
worshipper of the one true God was found among men; because from Noah, who, with his
wife, three sons, and as many daughters-in-law, achieved deliverance in the ark from the
destruction of the deluge, down to Abraham, we do not find in the canonical books that the
piety of any one is celebrated by express divine testimony, unless it be in the case of Noah,
who commends with a prophetic benediction his two sons Shem and Japheth, while he beheld
and foresaw what was long afterwards to happen. It was also by this prophetic spirit that,
when his middle son—that is, the son who was younger than the first and older than the
last born—had sinned against him, he cursed him not in his own person, but in his son’s
(his own grandson’s), in the words, “Cursed be the lad Canaan; a servant shall he be unto
his brethren.”858 Now Canaan was born of Ham, who, so far from covering his sleeping
father’s nakedness, had divulged it. For the same reason also he subjoins the blessing on
his two other sons, the oldest and youngest, saying, “Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and
Canaan shall be his servant. God shall gladden Japheth, and he shall dwell in the houses of
Shem.”859 And so, too, the planting of the vine by Noah, and his intoxication by its fruit,
and his nakedness while he slept, and the other things done at that time, and recorded, are
all of them pregnant with prophetic meanings, and veiled in mysteries.860</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—What Was Prophetically Prefigured in the Sons of Noah.</head>
<p>The things which then were hidden are now sufficiently revealed by the actual events
which have followed. For who can carefully and intelligently consider these things without
recognizing them accomplished in Christ? Shem, of whom Christ was born in the flesh,
means “named.” And what is of greater name than Christ, the fragrance of whose name is
now everywhere perceived, so that even prophecy sings of it beforehand, comparing it in
the Song of Songs,861 to ointment poured forth? Is it not also in the houses of Christ, that
is, in the churches, that the “enlargement” of the nations dwells? For Japheth means “enlargement.”
And Ham (i.e., hot), who was the middle son of Noah, and, as it were, separated
himself from both, and remained between them, neither belonging to the first-fruits of Israel
nor to the fullness of the Gentiles, what does he signify but the tribe of heretics, hot with
the spirit, not of patience, but of impatience, with which the breasts of heretics are wont to
blaze, and with which they disturb the peace of the saints? But even the heretics yield an
advantage to those that make proficiency, according to the apostle’s saying, “There must
also be heresies, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.”862
Whence, too, it is elsewhere said, “The son that receives instruction will be wise, and he uses
the foolish as his servant.”863 For while the hot restlessness of heretics stirs questions about
many articles of the catholic faith, the necessity of defending them forces us both to investigate
them more accurately, to understand them more clearly, and to proclaim them more
earnestly; and the question mooted by an adversary becomes the occasion of instruction.
However, not only those who are openly separated from the church, but also all who glory
in the Christian name, and at the same time lead abandoned lives, may without absurdity
seem to be figured by Noah’s middle son: for the passion of Christ, which was signified by
that man’s nakedness, is at once proclaimed by their profession, and dishonored by their
wicked conduct. Of such, therefore, it has been said, “By their fruits ye shall know them.”864
And therefore was Ham cursed in his son, he being, as it were, his fruit. So, too, this son of
his, Canaan, is fitly interpreted “their movement,” which is nothing else than their work.
But Shem and Japheth, that is to say, the circumcision and uncircumcision, or, as the apostle
otherwise calls them, the Jews and Greeks, but called and justified, having somehow discovered
the nakedness of their father (which signifies the Saviour’s passion), took a garment
and laid it upon their backs, and entered backwards and covered their father’s nakedness,
without their seeing what their reverence hid. For we both honor the passion of Christ as
accomplished for us, and we hate the crime of the Jews who crucified Him. The garment

<pb n="710"/>
signifies the sacrament, their backs the memory of things past: for the church celebrates
the passion of Christ as already accomplished, and no longer to be looked forward to, now
that Japheth already dwells in the habitations of Shem, and their wicked brother between
them.</p>
<p>But the wicked brother is, in the person of his son (i.e., his work), the boy, or slave, of
his good brothers, when good men make a skillful use of bad men, either for the exercise of
their patience or for their advancement in wisdom. For the apostle testifies that there are
some who preach Christ from no pure motives; “but,” says he, “whether in pretence or in
truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.”865 For it is Christ
Himself who planted the vine of which the prophet says, “The vine of the Lord of hosts is
the house of Israel;”866 and He drinks of its wine, whether we thus understand that cup of
which He says, “Can ye drink of the cup that I shall drink of?”867 and, “Father, if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me,”868 by which He obviously means His passion. Or, as wine is the
fruit of the vine, we may prefer to understand that from this vine, that is to say, from the
race of Israel, He has assumed flesh and blood that He might suffer; “and he was drunken,”
that is, He suffered; “and was naked,” that is, His weakness appeared in His suffering, as the
apostle says, “though He was crucified through weakness.”869 Wherefore the same apostle
says, “The weakness of God is stronger than men; and the foolishness of God is wiser than
men.”870 And when to the expression “he was naked” Scripture adds “in his house,” it elegantly
intimates that Jesus was to suffer the cross and death at the hands of His own household,
His own kith and kin, the Jews. This passion of Christ is only externally and verbally professed
by the reprobate, for what they profess, they do not understand. But the elect hold
in the inner man this so great mystery, and honor inwardly in the heart this weakness and
foolishness of God. And of this there is a figure in Ham going out to proclaim his father’s
nakedness; while Shem and Japheth, to cover or honor it, went in, that is to say, did it inwardly.</p>
<p>These secrets of divine Scripture we investigate as well as we can. All will not accept
our interpretation with equal confidence, but all hold it certain that these things were neither
done nor recorded without some foreshadowing of future events, and that they are to be
referred only to Christ and His church, which is the city of God, proclaimed from the very
beginning of human history by figures which we now see everywhere accomplished. From

the blessing of the two sons of Noah, and the cursing of the middle son, down to Abraham,
or for more than a thousand years, there is, as I have said, no mention of any righteous
persons who worshipped God. I do not therefore conclude that there were none; but it had
been tedious to mention every one, and would have displayed historical accuracy rather
than prophetic foresight. The object of the writer of these sacred books, or rather of the
Spirit of God in him, is not only to record the past, but to depict the future, so far as it regards
the city of God; for whatever is said of those who are not its citizens, is given either for her
instruction, or as a foil to enhance her glory. Yet we are not to suppose that all that is recorded
has some signification; but those things which have no signification of their own are
interwoven for the sake of the things which are significant. It is only the ploughshare that
cleaves the soil; but to effect this, other parts of the plough are requisite. It is only the strings
in harps and other musical instruments which produce melodious sounds; but that they
may do so, there are other parts of the instrument which are not indeed struck by those who
sing, but are connected with the strings which are struck, and produce musical notes. So
in this prophetic history some things are narrated which have no significance, but are, as it
were, the framework to which the significant things are attached.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Of the Generations of the Three Sons of Noah.</head>
<p>We must therefore introduce into this work an explanation of the generations of the
three sons of Noah, in so far as that may illustrate the progress in time of the two cities.
Scripture first mentions that of the youngest son, who is called Japheth: he had eight sons,871
and by two of these sons seven grandchildren, three by one son, four by the other; in all,
fifteen descendants. Ham, Noah’s middle son, had four sons, and by one of them five
grandsons, and by one of these two great-grandsons; in all, eleven. After enumerating these,
Scripture returns to the first of the sons, and says, “Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a
giant on the earth. He was a giant hunter against the Lord God: wherefore they say, As
Nimrod the giant hunter against the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon,
Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Assur, and
built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah:
this was a great city.” Now this Cush, father of the giant Nimrod, is the first-named among
the sons of Ham, to whom five sons and two grandsons are ascribed. But he either begat
this giant after his grandsons were born, or, which is more credible, Scripture speaks of him
separately on account of his eminence; for mention is also made of his kingdom, which
began with that magnificent city Babylon, and the other places, whether cities or districts,
mentioned along with it. But what is recorded of the land of Shinar which belonged to
Nimrod’s kingdom, to wit, that Assur went forth from it and built Nineveh and the other
cities mentioned with it, happened long after; but he takes occasion to speak of it here on
account of the grandeur of the Assyrian kingdom, which was wonderfully extended by Ninus
son of Belus, and founder of the great city Nineveh, which was named after him, Nineveh,
from Ninus. But Assur, father of the Assyrian, was not one of the sons of Ham, Noah’s son,
but is found among the sons of Shem, his eldest son. Whence it appears that among Shem’s
offspring there arose men who afterwards took possession of that giant’s kingdom, and advancing
from it, founded other cities, the first of which was called Nineveh, from Ninus.
From him Scripture returns to Ham’s other son, Mizraim; and his sons are enumerated,
not as seven individuals, but as seven nations. And from the sixth, as if from the sixth son,
the race called the Philistines are said to have sprung; so that there are in all eight. Then it
returns again to Canaan, in whose person Ham was cursed; and his eleven sons are named.
Then the territories they occupied, and some of the cities, are named. And thus, if we count
sons and grandsons, there are thirty-one of Ham’s descendants registered.</p>
<p>It remains to mention the sons of Shem, Noah’s eldest son; for to him this genealogical
narrative gradually ascends from the youngest. But in the commencement of the record of
<note type="footnote">871 Augustin here follows the Greek version, which introduces the name Elisa among the sons of Japheth,
though not found in the Hebrew. It is not found in the Complutensian Greek translation, nor in the Mss. used
by Jerome.</note>

<pb n="713"/>
Shem’s sons there is an obscurity which calls for explanation, since it is closely connected
with the object of our investigation. For we read, “Unto Shem also, the father of all the
children of Heber, the brother of Japheth the elder, were children born.”872 This is the order
of the words: And to Shem was born Heber, even to himself, that is, to Shem himself was
born Heber, and Shem is the father of all his children. We are intended to understand that
Shem is the patriarch of all his posterity who were to be mentioned, whether sons, grandsons,
great-grandsons, or descendants at any remove. For Shem did not beget Heber, who was
indeed in the fifth generation from him. For Shem begat, among other sons, Arphaxad;
Arphaxad begat Cainan, Cainan begat Salah, Salah begat Heber. And it was with good
reason that he was named first among Shem’s offspring, taking precedence even of his sons,
though only a grandchild of the fifth generation; for from him, as tradition says, the Hebrews
derived their name, though the other etymology which derives the name from Abraham (as
if Abrahews) may possibly be correct. But there can be little doubt that the former is the
right etymology, and that they were called after Heber, Heberews, and then, dropping a letter,
Hebrews; and so was their language called Hebrew, which was spoken by none but the
people of Israel among whom was the city of God, mysteriously prefigured in all the people,
and truly present in the saints. Six of Shem’s sons then are first named, then four grandsons
born to one of these sons; then it mentions another son of Shem, who begat a grandson;
and his son, again, or Shem’s great-grandson, was Heber. And Heber begat two sons, and
called the one Peleg, which means “dividing;” and Scripture subjoins the reason of this
name, saying, “for in his days was the earth divided.” What this means will afterwards appear.
Heber’s other son begat twelve sons; consequently all Shem’s descendants are twentyseven.
The total number of the progeny of the three sons of Noah is seventy-three, fifteen
by Japheth, thirty-one by Ham, twenty-seven by Shem. Then Scripture adds, “These are
the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.”
And so of the whole number “These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations,
in their nations; and by these were the isles of the nations dispersed through the earth
after the flood.” From which we gather that the seventy-three (or rather, as I shall presently
show, seventy-two) were not individuals, but nations. For in a former passage, when the
sons of Japheth were enumerated, it is said in conclusion, “By these were the isles of the
nations divided in their lands, every one after his language, in their tribes, and in their nations.”</p>
<p>But nations are expressly mentioned among the sons of Ham, as I showed above.
“Mizraim begat those who are called Ludim;” and so also of the other seven nations. And
after enumerating all of them, it concludes, “These are the sons of Ham, in their families,
according to their languages, in their territories, and in their nations.” The reason, then,
<note type="footnote">872 Gen. x. 21.</note>

<pb n="714"/>
why the children of several of them are not mentioned, is that they belonged by birth to
other nations, and did not themselves become nations. Why else is it, that though eight
sons are reckoned to Japheth, the sons of only two of these are mentioned; and though four
are reckoned to Ham, only three are spoken of as having sons; and though six are reckoned
to Shem, the descendants of only two of these are traced? Did the rest remain childless?
We cannot suppose so; but they did not produce nations so great as to warrant their being
mentioned, but were absorbed in the nations to which they belonged by birth.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Of the Diversity of Languages, and of the Founding of Babylon.</head>
<p>But though these nations are said to have been dispersed according to their languages,
yet the narrator recurs to that time when all had but one language, and explains how it came
to pass that a diversity of languages was introduced. “The whole earth,” he says, “was of
one lip, and all had one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there. And they said one to another,
Come, and let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had bricks for stone,
and slime for mortar. And they said, Come, and let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower
whose top shall reach the sky; and let us make us a name, before we be scattered abroad on
the face of all the earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded. And the Lord God said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them,
which they have imagined to do. Come, and let us go down, and confound there their language,
that they may not understand one another’s speech. And God scattered them thence
on the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city and the tower. Therefore the
name of it is called Confusion; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the
earth: and the Lord God scattered them thence on the face of all the earth.”873 This city,
which was called Confusion, is the same as Babylon, whose wonderful construction Gentile
history also notices. For Babylon means Confusion. Whence we conclude that the giant
Nimrod was its founder, as had been hinted a little before, where Scripture, in speaking of
him, says that the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, that is, Babylon had a supremacy
over the other cities as the metropolis and royal residence; although it did not rise to the
grand dimensions designed by its proud and impious founder. The plan was to make it so
high that it should reach the sky, whether this was meant of one tower which they intended
to build higher than the others, or of all the towers, which might be signified by the singular
number, as we speak of “the soldier,” meaning the army, and of the frog or the locust, when
we refer to the whole multitude of frogs and locusts in the plagues with which Moses smote
the Egyptians.874 But what did these vain and presumptuous men intend? How did they
expect to raise this lofty mass against God, when they had built it above all the mountains
and the clouds of the earth’s atmosphere? What injury could any spiritual or material elevation
do to God? The safe and true way to heaven is made by humility, which lifts up the
heart to the Lord, not against Him; as this giant is said to have been a “hunter against the
Lord.” This has been misunderstood by some through the ambiguity of the Greek word,
and they have translated it, not “against the Lord,” but “before the Lord;” for ἐναντίον means
both “before” and “against.” In the Psalm this word is rendered, “Let us weep before the
<note type="footnote">873 Gen. xi. 1–9.</note>
<note type="footnote">874 Ex. x.</note>

<pb n="716"/>
Lord our Maker.”875 The same word occurs in the book of Job, where it is written, “Thou
hast broken into fury against the Lord.”876 And so this giant is to be recognized as a “hunter
against the Lord.” And what is meant by the term “hunter” but deceiver, oppressor, and
destroyer of the animals of the earth? He and his people therefore, erected this tower against
the Lord, and so gave expression to their impious pride; and justly was their wicked intention
punished by God, even though it was unsuccessful. But what was the nature of the punishment?
As the tongue is the instrument of domination, in it pride was punished; so that
man, who would not understand God when He issued His commands, should be misunderstood
when he himself gave orders. Thus was that conspiracy disbanded, for each man retired
from those he could not understand, and associated with those whose speech was intelligible;
and the nations were divided according to their languages, and scattered over the earth as
seemed good to God, who accomplished this in ways hidden from and incomprehensible
to us.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of God’s Coming Down to Confound the Languages of the Builders of
the City.</head>
<p>We read, “The Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men
built:” it was not the sons of God, but that society which lived in a merely human way, and
which we call the earthly city. God, who is always wholly everywhere, does not move locally;
but He is said to descend when He does anything in the earth out of the usual course, which,
as it were, makes His presence felt. And in the same way, He does not by “seeing” learn
some new thing, for He cannot ever be ignorant of anything; but He is said to see and recognize,
in time, that which He causes others to see and recognize. And therefore that city was
not previously being seen as God made it be seen when He showed how offensive it was to
Him. We might, indeed, interpret God’s descending to the city of the descent of His angels
in whom He dwells; so that the following words, “And the Lord God said, Behold, they are
all one race and of one language,” and also what follows, “Come, and let us go down and
confound their speech,” are a recapitulation, explaining how the previously intimated
“descent of the Lord” was accomplished. For if He had already gone down, why does He
say, “Come, and let us go down and confound?”—words which seem to be addressed to the
angels, and to intimate that He who was in the angels descended in their descent. And the
words most appropriately are, not, “Go ye down and confound,” but, “Let us confound their
speech;” showing that He so works by His servants, that they are themselves also fellowlaborers
with God, as the apostle says, “For we are fellow-laborers with God.”877</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—What We are to Understand by God’s Speaking to the Angels.</head>
<p>We might have supposed that the words uttered at the creation of man, “Let us,” and
not Let me, “make man,” were addressed to the angels, had He not added “in our image;”
but as we cannot believe that man was made in the image of angels, or that the image of
God is the same as that of angels, it is proper to refer this expression to the plurality of the
Trinity. And yet this Trinity, being one God, even after saying “Let us make,” goes on to
say, “And God made man in His image,”878 and not “Gods made,” or “in their image.” And
were there any difficulty in applying to the angels the words, “Come, and let us go down
and confound their speech,” we might refer the plural to the Trinity, as if the Father were
addressing the Son and the Holy Spirit; but it rather belongs to the angels to approach God
by holy movements, that is, by pious thoughts, and thereby to avail themselves of the unchangeable
truth which rules in the court of heaven as their eternal law. For they are not
themselves the truth; but partaking in the creative truth, they are moved towards it as the
fountain of life, that what they have not in themselves they may obtain in it. And this
movement of theirs is steady, for they never go back from what they have reached. And to
these angels God does not speak, as we speak to one another, or to God, or to angels, or as
the angels speak to us, or as God speaks to us through them: He speaks to them in an ineffable
manner of His own, and that which He says is conveyed to us in a manner suited to our
capacity. For the speaking of God antecedent and superior to all His works, is the immutable
reason of His work: it has no noisy and passing sound, but an energy eternally abiding and
producing results in time. Thus He speaks to the holy angels; but to us, who are far off, He
speaks otherwise. When, however, we hear with the inner ear some part of the speech of
God, we approximate to the angels. But in this work I need not labor to give an account of
the ways in which God speaks. For either the unchangeable Truth speaks directly to the
mind of the rational creature in some indescribable way, or speaks through the changeable
creature, either presenting spiritual images to our spirit, or bodily voices to our bodily sense.</p>
<p>The words, “Nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do,”879
are assuredly not meant as an affirmation, but as an interrogation, such as is used by persons
threatening, as e.g., when Dido exclaims,</p>
<p>“They will not take arms and pursue?”880</p>
<p>We are to understand the words as if it had been said, Shall nothing be restrained from
them which they have imagined to do?881 From these three men, therefore, the three sons

of Noah we mean, 73, or rather, as the catalogue will show, 72 nations and as many languages
were dispersed over the earth, and as they increased filled even the islands. But the nations

nations which have but one language; and who can doubt that, as the human race increased,
men contrived to pass to the islands in ships?</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Whether Even the Remotest Islands Received Their Fauna from the
Animals Which Were Preserved, Through the Deluge, in the Ark.</head>
<p>There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts which are not domesticated,
nor are produced like frogs from the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents,
such as wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how they could be found in the islands
after the deluge, in which all the animals not in the ark perished, unless the breed was restored
from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark. It might, indeed, be said that they
crossed to the islands by swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the
mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy no animal could swim to them.
But if men caught them and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated these
breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase. At
the same time, it cannot be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be transferred
by God’s order or permission. If, however, they were produced out of the earth as at their
first creation, when God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature,”882 this makes
it more evident that all kinds of animals were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake
of renewing the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which were to be saved in the
church; this, I say, is more evident, if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to
which they could not cross over.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Whether Certain Monstrous Races of Men are Derived from the Stock
of Adam or Noah’s Sons.</head>
<p>It is also asked whether we are to believe that certain monstrous races of men, spoken
of in secular history,883 have sprung from Noah’s sons, or rather, I should say, from that
one man from whom they themselves were descended. For it is reported that some have
one eye in the middle of the forehead; some, feet turned backwards from the heel; some, a
double sex, the right breast like a man, the left like a woman, and that they alternately beget
and bring forth: others are said to have no mouth, and to breathe only through the nostrils;
others are but a cubit high, and are therefore called by the Greeks “Pigmies:”884 they say
that in some places the women conceive in their fifth year, and do not live beyond their
eighth. So, too, they tell of a race who have two feet but only one leg, and are of marvellous
swiftness, though they do not bend the knee: they are called Skiopodes, because in the hot
weather they lie down on their backs and shade themselves with their feet. Others are said
to have no head, and their eyes in their shoulders; and other human or quasi-human races
are depicted in mosaic in the harbor esplanade of Carthage, on the faith of histories of rarities.
What shall I say of the Cynocephali, whose dog-like head and barking proclaim them
beasts rather than men? But we are not bound to believe all we hear of these monstrosities.
But whoever is anywhere born a man, that is, a rational, mortal animal, no matter what
unusual appearance he presents in color, movement, sound, nor how peculiar he is in some
power, part, or quality of his nature, no Christian can doubt that he springs from that one
protoplast. We can distinguish the common human nature from that which is peculiar,
and therefore wonderful.</p>
<p>The same account which is given of monstrous births in individual cases can be given
of monstrous races. For God, the Creator of all, knows where and when each thing ought
to be, or to have been created, because He sees the similarities and diversities which can
contribute to the beauty of the whole. But He who cannot see the whole is offended by the
deformity of the part, because he is blind to that which balances it, and to which it belongs.
We know that men are born with more than four fingers on their hands or toes on their
feet: this is a smaller matter; but far from us be the folly of supposing that the Creator mistook
the number of a man’s fingers, though we cannot account for the difference. And so in
cases where the divergence from the rule is greater. He whose works no man justly finds
fault with, knows what He has done. At Hippo-Diarrhytus there is a man whose hands are
crescent-shaped, and have only two fingers each, and his feet similarly formed. If there were
a race like him, it would be added to the history of the curious and wonderful. Shall we
therefore deny that this man is descended from that one man who was first created? As for

the Androgyni, or Hermaphrodites, as they are called, though they are rare, yet from time
to time there appears persons of sex so doubtful, that it remains uncertain from which sex
they take their name; though it is customary to give them a masculine name, as the more
worthy. For no one ever called them Hermaphroditesses. Some years ago, quite within my
own memory, a man was born in the East, double in his upper, but single in his lower
half—having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary
man; and he lived so long that many had an opportunity of seeing him. But who could
enumerate all the human births that have differed widely from their ascertained parents?
As, therefore, no one will deny that these are all descended from that one man, so all the
races which are reported to have diverged in bodily appearance from the usual course which
nature generally or almost universally preserves, if they are embraced in that definition of
man as rational and mortal animals, unquestionably trace their pedigree to that one first
father of all. We are supposing these stories about various races who differ from one another
and from us to be true; but possibly they are not: for if we were not aware that apes, and
monkeys, and sphinxes are not men, but beasts, those historians would possibly describe
them as races of men, and flaunt with impunity their false and vainglorious discoveries.
But supposing they are men of whom these marvels are recorded, what if God has seen fit
to create some races in this way, that we might not suppose that the monstrous births which
appear among ourselves are the failures of that wisdom whereby He fashions the human
nature, as we speak of the failure of a less perfect workman? Accordingly, it ought not to
seem absurd to us, that as in individual races there are monstrous births, so in the whole
race there are monstrous races. Wherefore, to conclude this question cautiously and
guardedly, either these things which have been told of some races have no existence at all;
or if they do exist, they are not human races; or if they are human, they are descended from
Adam.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Whether We are to Believe in the Antipodes.</head>
<p>But as to the fable that there are Antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of
the earth, where the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours,
that is on no ground credible. And, indeed, it is not affirmed that this has been learned by
historical knowledge, but by scientific conjecture, on the ground that the earth is suspended
within the concavity of the sky, and that it has as much room on the one side of it as on the
other: hence they say that the part which is beneath must also be inhabited. But they do
not remark that, although it be supposed or scientifically demonstrated that the world is of
a round and spherical form, yet it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare of
water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled. For Scripture,
which proves the truth of its historical statements by the accomplishment of its prophecies,
gives no false information; and it is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship
and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other,
and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first
man. Wherefore let us seek if we can find the city of God that sojourns on earth among
those human races who are catalogued as having been divided into seventy-two nations and
as many languages. For it continued down to the deluge and the ark, and is proved to have
existed still among the sons of Noah by their blessings, and chiefly in the eldest son Shem;
for Japheth received this blessing, that he should dwell in the tents of Shem.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Of the Genealogy of Shem, in Whose Line the City of God is Preserved
Till the Time of Abraham.</head>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, to preserve the series of generations descending from Shem,
for the sake of exhibiting the city of God after the flood; as before the flood it was exhibited
in the series of generations descending from Seth. And therefore does divine Scripture,
after exhibiting the earthly city as Babylon or “Confusion,” revert to the patriarch Shem,
and recapitulate the generations from him to Abraham, specifying besides, the year in which
each father begat the son that belonged to this line, and how long he lived. And unquestionably
it is this which fulfills the promise I made, that it should appear why it is said of the
sons of Heber, “The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided.”885
For what can we understand by the division of the earth, if not the diversity of languages?
And, therefore, omitting the other sons of Shem, who are not concerned in this matter,
Scripture gives the genealogy of those by whom the line runs on to Abraham, as before the
flood those are given who carried on the line to Noah from Seth. Accordingly this series of
generations begins thus: “These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood. And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad
five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.” In like manner it registers the rest,
naming the year of his life in which each begat the son who belonged to that line which extends
to Abraham. It specifies, too, how many years he lived thereafter, begetting sons and
daughters, that we may not childishly suppose that the men named were the only men, but
may understand how the population increased, and how regions and kingdoms so vast could
be populated by the descendants of Shem; especially the kingdom of Assyria, from which
Ninus subdued the surrounding nations, reigning with brilliant prosperity, and bequeathing
to his descendants a vast but thoroughly consolidated empire, which held together for many
centuries.</p>
<p>But to avoid needless prolixity, we shall mention not the number of years each member
of this series lived, but only the year of his life in which he begat his heir, that we may thus
reckon the number of years from the flood to Abraham, and may at the same time leave
room to touch briefly and cursorily upon some other matters necessary to our argument.
In the second year, then, after the flood, Shem when he was a hundred years old begat
Arphaxad; Arphaxad when he was 135 years old begat Cainan; Cainan when he was 130
years begat Salah. Salah himself, too, was the same age when he begat Eber. Eber lived 134
years, and begat Peleg, in whose days the earth was divided. Peleg himself lived 130 years,
and begat Reu; and Reu lived 132 years, and begat Serug; Serug 130, and begat Nahor; and
Nahor 79, and begat Terah; and Terah 70, and begat Abram, whose name God afterwards
changed into Abraham. There are thus from the flood to Abraham 1072 years, according
<note type="footnote">885 Gen. x. 25.</note>

<pb n="725"/>
to the Vulgate or Septuagint versions. In the Hebrew copies far fewer years are given; and
for this either no reason or a not very credible one is given.</p>
<p>When, therefore, we look for the city of God in these seventy-two nations, we cannot
affirm that while they had but one lip, that is, one language, the human race had departed
from the worship of the true God, and that genuine godliness had survived only in those
generations which descend from Shem through Arphaxad and reach to Abraham; but from
the time when they proudly built a tower to heaven, a symbol of godless exaltation, the city
or society of the wicked becomes apparent. Whether it was only disguised before, or nonexistent;
whether both cities remained after the flood,—the godly in the two sons of Noah
who were blessed, and in their posterity, and the ungodly in the cursed son and his descendants,
from whom sprang that mighty hunter against the Lord,—is not easily determined.
For possibly—and certainly this is more credible—there were despisers of God among the
descendants of the two sons, even before Babylon was founded, and worshippers of God
among the descendants of Ham. Certainly neither race was ever obliterated from earth.
For in both the Psalms in which it is said, “They are all gone aside, they are altogether become
filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one,” we read further, “Have all the workers
of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the
Lord.”886 There was then a people of God even at that time. And therefore the words,
“There is none that doeth good, no, not one,” were said of the sons of men, not of the sons
of God. For it had been previously said, “God looked down from heaven upon the sons of
men, to see if any understood and sought after God;” and then follow the words which
demonstrate that all the sons of men, that is, all who belong to the city which lives according
to man, not according to God, are reprobate.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—That the Original Language in Use Among Men Was that Which Was
Afterwards Called Hebrew, from Heber, in Whose Family It Was Preserved
When the Confusion of Tongues Occurred.</head>
<p>Wherefore, as the fact of all using one language did not secure the absence of sin-infected
men from the race,—for even before the deluge there was one language, and yet all but the
single family of just Noah were found worthy of destruction by the flood,—so when the
nations, by a prouder godlessness, earned the punishment of the dispersion and the confusion
of tongues, and the city of the godless was called Confusion or Babylon, there was still the
house of Heber in which the primitive language of the race survived. And therefore, as I
have already mentioned, when an enumeration is made of the sons of Shem, who each
founded a nation, Heber is first mentioned, although he was of the fifth generation from
Shem. And because, when the other races were divided by their own peculiar languages,
his family preserved that language which is not unreasonably believed to have been the
common language of the race, it was on this account thenceforth named Hebrew. For it
then became necessary to distinguish this language from the rest by a proper name; though,
while there was only one, it had no other name than the language of man, or human speech,
it alone being spoken by the whole human race. Some one will say: If the earth was divided
by languages in the days of Peleg, Heber’s son, that language, which was formerly common
to all, should rather have been called after Peleg. But we are to understand that Heber
himself gave to his son this name Peleg, which means Division; because he was born when
the earth was divided, that is, at the very time of the division, and that this is the meaning
of the words, “In his days the earth was divided.”887 For unless Heber had been still alive
when the languages were multiplied, the language which was preserved in his house would
not have been called after him. We are induced to believe that this was the primitive and
common language, because the multiplication and change of languages was introduced as
a punishment, and it is fit to ascribe to the people of God an immunity from this punishment.
Nor is it without significance that this is the language which Abraham retained, and that he
could not transmit it to all his descendants, but only to those of Jacob’s line, who distinctively
and eminently constituted God’s people, and received His covenants, and were Christ’s
progenitors according to the flesh. In the same way, Heber himself did not transmit that
language to all his posterity, but only to the line from which Abraham sprang. And thus,
although it is not expressly stated, that when the wicked were building Babylon there was
a godly seed remaining, this indistinctness is intended to stimulate research rather than to
elude it. For when we see that originally there was one common language, and that Heber
is mentioned before all Shem’s sons, though he belonged to the fifth generation from him,
and that the language which the patriarchs and prophets used, not only in their conversation,
<note type="footnote">887 Gen. x. 25.</note>

<pb n="727"/>
but in the authoritative language of Scripture, is called Hebrew, when we are asked where
that primitive and common language was preserved after the confusion of tongues, certainly,
as there can be no doubt that those among whom it was preserved were exempt from the
punishment it embodied, what other suggestion can we make, than that it survived in the
family of him whose name it took, and that this is no small proof of the righteousness of
this family, that the punishment with which the other families were visited did not fall upon
it?</p>
<p>But yet another question is mooted: How did Heber and his son Peleg each found a
nation, if they had but one language? For no doubt the Hebrew nation propagated from
Heber through Abraham, and becoming through him a great people, is one nation. How,
then, are all the sons of the three branches of Noah’s family enumerated as founding a nation
each, if Heber and Peleg did not so? It is very probable that the giant Nimrod founded also
his nation, and that Scripture has named him separately on account of the extraordinary
dimensions of his empire and of his body, so that the number of seventy-two nations remains.
But Peleg was mentioned, not because he founded a nation (for his race and language
are Hebrew), but on account of the critical time at which he was born, all the earth being
then divided. Nor ought we to be surprised that the giant Nimrod lived to the time in which
Babylon was founded and the confusion of tongues occurred, and the consequent division
of the earth. For though Heber was in the sixth generation from Noah, and Nimrod in the
fourth, it does not follow that they could not be alive at the same time. For when the generations
are few, they live longer and are born later; but when they are many, they live a
shorter time, and come into the world earlier. We are to understand that, when the earth
was divided, the descendants of Noah who are registered as founders of nations were not
only already born, but were of an age to have immense families, worthy to be called tribes
or nations. And therefore we must by no means suppose that they were born in the order
in which they were set down; otherwise, how could the twelve sons of Joktan, another son
of Heber’s, and brother of Peleg, have already founded nations, if Joktan was born, as he is
registered, after his brother Peleg, since the earth was divided at Peleg’s birth? We are
therefore to understand that, though Peleg is named first, he was born long after Joktan,
whose twelve sons had already families so large as to admit of their being divided by different
languages. There is nothing extraordinary in the last born being first named: of the sons
of Noah, the descendants of Japheth are first named; then the sons of Ham, who was the
second son; and last the sons of Shem, who was the first and oldest. Of these nations the
names have partly survived, so that at this day we can see from whom they have sprung, as
the Assyrians from Assur, the Hebrews from Heber, but partly have been altered in the lapse
of time, so that the most learned men, by profound research in ancient records, have scarcely
been able to discover the origin, I do not say of all, but of some of these nations. There is,
for example, nothing in the name Egyptians to show that they are descended from Misraim,

<pb n="728"/>
Ham’s son, nor in the name Ethiopians to show a connection with Cush, though such is
said to be the origin of these nations. And if we take a general survey of the names, we shall
find that more have been changed than have remained the same.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Of the Era in Abraham’s Life from Which a New Period in the Holy
Succession Begins.</head>
<p>Let us now survey the progress of the city of God from the era of the patriarch Abraham,
from whose time it begins to be more conspicuous, and the divine promises which are now
fulfilled in Christ are more fully revealed. We learn, then, from the intimations of holy
Scripture, that Abraham was born in the country of the Chaldeans, a land belonging to the
Assyrian empire. Now, even at that time impious superstitions were rife with the Chaldeans,
as with other nations. The family of Terah, to which Abraham belonged, was the only one
in which the worship of the true God survived, and the only one, we may suppose, in which
the Hebrew language was preserved; although Joshua the son of Nun tells us that even this
family served other gods in Mesopotamia.888 The other descendants of Heber gradually
became absorbed in other races and other languages. And thus, as the single family of Noah
was preserved through the deluge of water to renew the human race, so, in the deluge of
superstition that flooded the whole world, there remained but the one family of Terah in
which the seed of God’s city was preserved. And as, when Scripture has enumerated the
generations prior to Noah, with their ages, and explained the cause of the flood before God
began to speak to Noah about the building of the ark, it is said, “These are the generations
of Noah;” so also now, after enumerating the generations from Shem, Noah’s son, down to
Abraham, it then signalizes an era by saying, “These are the generations of Terah: Terah
begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. And Haran died before his father
Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. And Abram and Nahor took them
wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife Milcah, the
daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.”889 This Iscah is supposed
to be the same as Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Why, in the Account of Terah’s Emigration, on His Forsaking the
Chaldeans and Passing Over into Mesopotamia, No Mention is Made of His Son
Nahor.</head>
<p>Next it is related how Terah with his family left the region of the Chaldeans and came
into Mesopotamia, and dwelt in Haran. But nothing is said about one of his sons called
Nahor, as if he had not taken him along with him. For the narrative runs thus: “And Terah
took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarah his daughter-in-law,
his son Abram’s wife, and led them forth out of the region of the Chaldeans to go into the
land of Canaan; and he came into Haran, and dwelt there.”890 Nahor and Milcah his wife
are nowhere named here. But afterwards, when Abraham sent his servant to take a wife for
his son Isaac, we find it thus written: “And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his
lord, and of all the goods of his lord, with him; and arose, and went into Mesopotamia, into
the city of Nahor.”891 This and other testimonies of this sacred history show that Nahor,
Abraham’s brother, had also left the region of the Chaldeans, and fixed his abode in Mesopotamia,
where Abraham dwelt with his father. Why, then, did the Scripture not mention
him, when Terah with his family went forth out of the Chaldean nation and dwelt in Haran,
since it mentions that he took with him not only Abraham his son, but also Sarah his
daughter-in-law, and Lot his grandson? The only reason we can think of is, that perhaps
he had lapsed from the piety of his father and brother, and adhered to the superstition of
the Chaldeans, and had afterwards emigrated thence, either through penitence, or because
he was persecuted as a suspected person. For in the book called Judith, when Holofernes,
the enemy of the Israelites, inquired what kind of nation that might be, and whether war
should be made against them, Achior, the leader of the Ammonites, answered him thus:
“Let our lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee
the truth concerning the people which dwelleth near thee in this hill country, and there shall
no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant. For this people is descended from the Chaldeans,
and they dwelt heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their
fathers, which were glorious in the land of the Chaldeans, but went out of the way of their
ancestors, and adored the God of heaven, whom they knew; and they cast them out from
the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and dwelt there many days. And
their God said to them, that they should depart from their habitation, and go into the land
of Canaan; and they dwelt,”892 etc., as Achior the Ammonite narrates. Whence it is manifest
that the house of Terah had suffered persecution from the Chaldeans for the true piety with
which they worshipped the one and true God.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Years of Terah, Who Completed His Lifetime in Haran.</head>
<p>On Terah’s death in Mesopotamia, where he is said to have lived 205 years, the promises
of God made to Abraham now begin to be pointed out; for thus it is written: “And the days
of Terah in Haran were two hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.”893 This is not
to be taken as if he had spent all his days there, but that he there completed the days of his
life, which were two hundred and five years: otherwise it would not be known how many
years Terah lived, since it is not said in what year of his life he came into Haran; and it is
absurd to suppose that, in this series of generations, where it is carefully recorded how many
years each one lived, his age was the only one not put on record. For although some whom
the same Scripture mentions have not their age recorded, they are not in this series, in which
the reckoning of time is continuously indicated by the death of the parents and the succession
of the children. For this series, which is given in order from Adam to Noah, and from him
down to Abraham, contains no one without the number of the years of his life.</p>

<pb n="732"/>
<head>Chapter 15.—Of the Time of the Migration of Abraham, When, According to the
Commandment of God, He Went Out from Haran.</head>
<p>When, after the record of the death of Terah, the father of Abraham, we next read, “And
the Lord said to Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father’s house,”894 etc., it is not to be supposed, because this follows in the order of the
narrative, that it also followed in the chronological order of events. For if it were so, there
would be an insoluble difficulty. For after these words of God which were spoken to Abraham,
the Scripture says: “And Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot
went with him. Now Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.”
895 How can this be true if he departed from Haran after his father’s death? For when
Terah was seventy years old, as is intimated above, he begat Abraham; and if to this number
we add the seventy-five years which Abraham reckoned when he went out of Haran, we get
145 years. Therefore that was the number of the years of Terah, when Abraham departed
out of that city of Mesopotamia; for he had reached the seventy-fifth year of his life, and
thus his father, who begat him in the seventieth year of his life, had reached, as was said, his
145th. Therefore he did not depart thence after his father’s death, that is, after the 205 years
his father lived; but the year of his departure from that place, seeing it was his seventy-fifth,
is inferred beyond a doubt to have been the 145th of his father, who begat him in his seventieth
year. And thus it is to be understood that the Scripture, according to its custom, has
gone back to the time which had already been passed by the narrative; just as above, when
it had mentioned the grandsons of Noah, it said that they were in their nations and tongues;
and yet afterwards, as if this also had followed in order of time, it says, “And the whole earth
was of one lip, and one speech for all.”896 How, then, could they be said to be in their own
nations and according to their own tongues, if there was one for all; except because the
narrative goes back to gather up what it had passed over? Here, too, in the same way, after
saying, “And the days of Terah in Haran were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran,” the
Scripture, going back to what had been passed over in order to complete what had been
begun about Terah, says, “And the Lord said to Abram, Get thee out of thy country,”897
etc. After which words of God it is added, “And Abram departed, as the Lord spake unto
him; and Lot went with him. But Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out
of Haran.” Therefore it was done when his father was in the 145th year of his age; for it was
then the seventy-fifth of his own. But this question is also solved in another way, that the
seventy-five years of Abraham when he departed out of Haran are reckoned from the year

<pb n="733"/>
in which he was delivered from the fire of the Chaldeans, not from that of his birth, as if he
was rather to be held as having been born then.</p>
<p>Now the blessed Stephen, in narrating these things in the Acts of the Apostles, says:
“The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before
he dwelt in Charran, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred,
and from thy father’s house, and come into the land which I will show thee.”898 According
to these words of Stephen, God spoke to Abraham, not after the death of his father, who
certainly died in Haran, where his son also dwelt with him, but before he dwelt in that city,
although he was already in Mesopotamia. Therefore he had already departed from the
Chaldeans. So that when Stephen adds, “Then Abraham went out of the land of the
Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran,”899 this does not point out what took place after God
spoke to him (for it was not after these words of God that he went out of the land of the
Chaldeans, since he says that God spoke to him in Mesopotamia), but the word “then” which
he uses refers to that whole period from his going out of the land of the Chaldeans and
dwelling in Haran. Likewise in what follows, “And thenceforth, when his father was dead,
he settled him in this land, wherein ye now dwell, and your fathers,” he does not say, after
his father was dead he went out from Haran; but thenceforth he settled him here, after his
father was dead. It is to be understood, therefore, that God had spoken to Abraham when
he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran; but that he came to Haran with his
father, keeping in mind the precept of God, and that he went out thence in his own seventyfifth
year, which was his father’s 145th. But he says that his settlement in the land of Canaan,
not his going forth from Haran, took place after his father’s death; because his father was
already dead when he purchased the land, and personally entered on possession of it. But
when, on his having already settled in Mesopotamia, that is, already gone out of the land of
the Chaldeans, God says, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father’s house,”900 this means, not that he should cast out his body from thence, for he had
already done that, but that he should tear away his soul. For he had not gone out from
thence in mind, if he was held by the hope and desire of returning,—a hope and desire which
was to be cut off by God’s command and help, and by his own obedience. It would indeed
be no incredible supposition that afterwards, when Nahor followed his father, Abraham
then fulfilled the precept of the Lord, that he should depart out of Haran with Sarah his wife
and Lot his brother’s son.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Of the Order and Nature of the Promises of God Which Were Made
to Abraham.</head>
<p>God’s promises made to Abraham are now to be considered; for in these the oracles of
our God,901 that is, of the true God, began to appear more openly concerning the godly
people, whom prophetic authority foretold. The first of these reads thus: “And the Lord
said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s
house, and go into a land that I will show thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and
I will bless thee and magnify thy name; and thou shall be blessed: and I will bless them that
bless thee, and curse them that curse thee: and in thee shall all tribes of the earth be
blessed.”902 Now it is to be observed that two things are promised to Abraham, the one,
that his seed should possess the land of Canaan, which is intimated when it is said, “Go into
a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation;” but the other far more
excellent, not about the carnal but the spiritual seed, through which he is the father, not of
the one Israelite nation, but of all nations who follow the footprints of his faith, which was
first promised in these words, “And in thee shall all tribes of the earth be blessed.” Eusebius
thought this promise was made in Abraham’s seventy-fifth year, as if soon after it was made
Abraham had departed out of Haran because the Scripture cannot be contradicted in which
we read, “Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.” But if this
promise was made in that year, then of course Abraham was staying in Haran with his
father; for he could not depart thence unless he had first dwelt there. Does this, then, contradict
what Stephen says, “The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was
in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran?”903 But it is to be understood that the whole
took place in the same year,—both the promise of God before Abraham dwelt in Haran,
and his dwelling in Haran, and his departure thence,—not only because Eusebius in the
Chronicles reckons from the year of this promise, and shows that after 430 years the exodus
from Egypt took place, when the law was given, but because the Apostle Paul also mentions
it.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Of the Three Most Famous Kingdoms of the Nations, of Which One,
that is the Assyrian, Was Already Very Eminent When Abraham Was Born.</head>
<p>During the same period there were three famous kingdoms of the nations, in which the
city of the earth-born, that is, the society of men living according to man under the domination
of the fallen angels, chiefly flourished, namely, the three kingdoms of Sicyon, Egypt,
and Assyria. Of these, Assyria was much the most powerful and sublime; for that king
Ninus, son of Belus, had subdued the people of all Asia except India. By Asia I now mean
not that part which is one province of this greater Asia, but what is called Universal Asia,
which some set down as the half, but most as the third part of the whole world,—the three
being Asia, Europe, and Africa, thereby making an unequal division. For the part called
Asia stretches from the south through the east even to the north; Europe from the north
even to the west; and Africa from the west even to the south. Thus we see that two, Europe
and Africa, contain one half of the world, and Asia alone the other half. And these two parts
are made by the circumstance, that there enters between them from the ocean all the
Mediterranean water, which makes this great sea of ours. So that, if you divide the world
into two parts, the east and the west, Asia will be in the one, and Europe and Africa in the
other. So that of the three kingdoms then famous, one, namely Sicyon, was not under the
Assyrians, because it was in Europe; but as for Egypt, how could it fail to be subject to the
empire which ruled all Asia with the single exception of India? In Assyria, therefore, the
dominion of the impious city had the pre-eminence. Its head was Babylon,—an earth-born
city, most fitly named, for it means confusion. There Ninus reigned after the death of his
father Belus, who first had reigned there sixty-five years. His son Ninus, who, on his father’s
death, succeeded to the kingdom, reigned fifty-two years, and had been king forty-three
years when Abraham was born, which was about the 1200th year before Rome was founded,
as it were another Babylon in the west.</p>

defence of his wife’s chastity, and providing as a man against human wiles; because if he
had not provided against the danger as much as he could, he would have been tempting
God rather than trusting in Him. We have said enough about this matter against the
calumnies of Faustus the Manichæan. At last what Abraham had expected the Lord to do
took place. For Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who had taken her to him as his wife, restored her

<p>On Abraham’s return out of Egypt to the place he had left, Lot, his brother’s son, departed
from him into the land of Sodom, without breach of charity. For they had grown rich, and
began to have many herdmen of cattle, and when these strove together, they avoided in this
way the pugnacious discord of their families. Indeed, as human affairs go, this cause might
even have given rise to some strife between themselves. Consequently these are the words
of Abraham to Lot, when taking precaution against this evil, “Let there be no strife between

not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself from me: if thou wilt go to the left hand,
I will go to the right; or if thou wilt go to the right hand, I will go to the left.”905 From this,
perhaps, has arisen a pacific custom among men, that when there is any partition of earthly
things, the greater should make the division, the less the choice.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Of the Third Promise of God, by Which He Assured the Land of
Canaan to Abraham and His Seed in Perpetuity.</head>
<p>Now, when Abraham and Lot had separated, and dwelt apart, owing to the necessity of
supporting their families, and not to vile discord, and Abraham was in the land of Canaan,
but Lot in Sodom, the Lord said to Abraham in a third oracle, “Lift up thine eyes, and look
from the place where thou now art, to the north, and to Africa, and to the east, and to the
sea; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I
will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any one can number the dust of the earth, thy
seed shall also be numbered. Arise, and walk through the land, in the length of it, and in
the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.”906 It does not clearly appear whether in this
promise that also is contained by which he is made the father of all nations. For the clause,
“And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth,” may seem to refer to this, being spoken
by that figure the Greeks call hyperbole, which indeed is figurative, not literal. But no person
of understanding can doubt in what manner the Scripture uses this and other figures. For
that figure (that is, way of speaking) is used when what is said is far larger than what is meant
by it; for who does not see how incomparably larger the number of the dust must be than
that of all men can be from Adam himself down to the end of the world? How much
greater, then, must it be than the seed of Abraham,—not only that pertaining to the nation
of Israel, but also that which is and shall be according to the imitation of faith in all nations
of the whole wide world! For that seed is indeed very small in comparison with the multitude
of the wicked, although even those few of themselves make an innumerable multitude, which
by a hyperbole is compared to the dust of the earth. Truly that multitude which was
promised to Abraham is not innumerable to God, although to man; but to God not even
the dust of the earth is so. Further, the promise here made may be understood not only of
the nation of Israel, but of the whole seed of Abraham, which may be fitly compared to the
dust for multitude, because regarding it also there is the promise907 of many children, not
according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. But we have therefore said that this does
not clearly appear, because the multitude even of that one nation, which was born according
to the flesh of Abraham through his grandson Jacob, has increased so much as to fill almost
all parts of the world. Consequently, even it might by hyperbole be compared to the dust
for multitude, because even it alone is innumerable by man. Certainly no one questions
that only that land is meant which is called Canaan. But that saying, “To thee will I give it,
and to thy seed for ever,” may move some, if by “for ever” they understand “to eternity.”
But if in this passage they take “for ever” thus, as we firmly hold it means that the beginning
of the world to come is to be ordered from the end of the present, there is still no difficulty,

because, although the Israelites are expelled from Jerusalem, they still remain in other cities
in the land of Canaan, and shall remain even to the end; and when that whole land is inhabited
by Christians, they also are the very seed of Abraham.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Of Abraham’s Overcoming the Enemies of Sodom, When He Delivered
Lot from Captivity and Was Blessed by Melchizedek the Priest.</head>
<p>Having received this oracle of promise, Abraham migrated, and remained in another
place of the same land, that is, beside the oak of Mamre, which was Hebron. Then on the
invasion of Sodom, when five kings carried on war against four, and Lot was taken captive
with the conquered Sodomites, Abraham delivered him from the enemy, leading with him
to battle three hundred and eighteen of his home-born servants, and won the victory for
the kings of Sodom, but would take nothing of the spoils when offered by the king for whom
he had won them. He was then openly blessed by Melchizedek, who was priest of God Most
High, about whom many and great things are written in the epistle which is inscribed to
the Hebrews, which most say is by the Apostle Paul, though some deny this. For then first
appeared the sacrifice which is now offered to God by Christians in the whole wide world,
and that is fulfilled which long after the event was said by the prophet to Christ, who was
yet to come in the flesh, “Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek,”908—that
is to say, not after the order of Aaron, for that order was to be taken away when the things
shone forth which were intimated beforehand by these shadows.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Of the Word of the Lord to Abraham, by Which It Was Promised to
Him that His Posterity Should Be Multiplied According to the Multitude of the
Stars; On Believing Which He Was Declared Justified While Yet in Uncircumcision.</head>
<p>The word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision also. For when God promised him
protection and exceeding great reward, he, being solicitous about posterity, said that a certain
Eliezer of Damascus, born in his house, would be his heir. Immediately he was promised
an heir, not that house-born servant, but one who was to come forth of Abraham himself;
and again a seed innumerable, not as the dust of the earth, but as the stars of heaven,—which
rather seems to me a promise of a posterity exalted in celestial felicity. For, so far as multitude
is concerned, what are the stars of heaven to the dust of the earth, unless one should say the
comparison is like inasmuch as the stars also cannot be numbered? For it is not to be believed
that all of them can be seen. For the more keenly one observes them, the more does he see.
So that it is to be supposed some remain concealed from the keenest observers, to say
nothing of those stars which are said to rise and set in another part of the world most remote
from us. Finally, the authority of this book condemns those like Aratus or Eudoxus, or any
others who boast that they have found out and written down the complete number of the
stars. Here, indeed, is set down that sentence which the apostle quotes in order to commend
the grace of God, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness;”909
lest the circumcision should glory, and be unwilling to receive the uncircumcised nations
to the faith of Christ. For at the time when he believed, and his faith was counted to him
for righteousness, Abraham had not yet been circumcised.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Of the Meaning of the Sacrifice Abraham Was Commanded to Offer
When He Supplicated to Be Taught About Those Things He Had Believed.</head>
<p>In the same vision, God in speaking to him also says, “I am God that brought thee out
of the region of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.”910 And when Abram asked
whereby he might know that he should inherit it, God said to him, “Take me an heifer of
three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove,
and a pigeon. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and
laid each piece one against another; but the birds divided he not. And the fowls came down,”
as it is written, “on the carcasses, and Abram sat down by them. But about the going down
of the sun, great fear fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
And He said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not
theirs, and they shall reduce them to servitude and shall afflict them four hundred years:
but the nation whom they shall serve will I judge; and afterward shall they come out hither
with great substance. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; kept in a good old age. But
in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is
not yet full. And when the sun was setting, there was a flame, and a smoking furnace, and
lamps of fire, that passed through between those pieces. In that day the Lord made a covenant
with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the
great river Euphrates: the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, and the Hittites,
and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites,
and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”911</p>
<p>All these things were said and done in a vision from God; but it would take long, and
would exceed the scope of this work, to treat of them exactly in detail. It is enough that we
should know that, after it was said Abram believed in God, and it was counted to him for
righteousness, he did not fail in faith in saying, “Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall
inherit it?” for the inheritance of that land was promised to him. Now he does not say, How
shall I know, as if he did not yet believe; but he says, “Whereby shall I know,” meaning that
some sign might be given by which he might know the manner of those things which he
had believed, just as it is not for lack of faith the Virgin Mary says, “How shall this be, seeing
I know not a man?”912 for she inquired as to the way in which that should take place which
she was certain would come to pass. And when she asked this, she was told, “The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.”913 Here
also, in fine, a symbol was given, consisting of three animals, a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram,

<pb n="744"/>
and two birds, a turtle-dove and pigeon, that he might know that the things which he had
not doubted should come to pass were to happen in accordance with this symbol. Whether,
therefore, the heifer was a sign that the people should be put under the law, the she-goat
that the same people was to become sinful, the ram that they should reign (and these animals
are said to be of three years old for this reason, that there are three remarkable divisions of
time, from Adam to Noah, and from him to Abraham, and from him to David, who, on the
rejection of Saul, was first established by the will of the Lord in the kingdom of the Israelite
nation: in this third division, which extends from Abraham to David, that people grew up
as if passing through the third age of life), or whether they had some other more suitable
meaning, still I have no doubt whatever that spiritual things were prefigured by them as
well as by the turtle-dove and pigeon. And it is said, “But the birds divided he not,” because
carnal men are divided among themselves, but the spiritual not at all, whether they seclude
themselves from the busy conversation of men, like the turtle-dove, or dwell among them,
like the pigeon; for both birds are simple and harmless, signifying that even in the Israelite
people, to which that land was to be given, there would be individuals who were children
of the promise, and heirs of the kingdom that is914 to remain in eternal felicity. But the
fowls coming down on the divided carcasses represent nothing good, but the spirits of this
air, seeking some food for themselves in the division of carnal men. But that Abraham sat
down with them, signifies that even amid these divisions of the carnal, true believers shall
persevere to the end. And that about the going down of the sun great fear fell upon Abraham
and a horror of great darkness, signifies that about the end of this world believers shall be
in great perturbation and tribulation, of which the Lord said in the gospel, “For then shall
be great tribulation, such as was not from the beginning.”915</p>
<p>But what is said to Abraham, “Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
land not theirs, and they shall reduce them to servitude, and shall afflict them 400 years,”
is most clearly a prophecy about the people of Israel which was to be in servitude in Egypt.
Not that this people was to be in that servitude under the oppressive Egyptians for 400 years,
but it is foretold that this should take place in the course of those 400 years. For as it is
written of Terah the father of Abraham, “And the days of Terah in Haran were 205 years,”916
not because they were all spent there, but because they were completed there, so it is said
here also, “And they shall reduce them to servitude, and shall afflict them 400 years,” for
this reason, because that number was completed, not because it was all spent in that affliction.
The years are said to be 400 in round numbers, although they were a little more,—whether
you reckon from this time, when these things were promised to Abraham, or from the birth

<note type="footnote">916 Gen. xi. 32.</note>

<pb n="745"/>
of Isaac, as the seed of Abraham, of which these things are predicted. For, as we have already
said above, from the seventy-fifth year of Abraham, when the first promise was made to
him, down to the exodus of Israel from Egypt, there are reckoned 430 years, which the
apostle thus mentions: “And this I say, that the covenant confirmed by God, the law, which
was made 430 years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.”
917 So then these 430 years might be called 400, because they are not much more, especially
since part even of that number had already gone by when these things were shown
and said to Abraham in vision, or when Isaac was born in his father’s 100th year, twentyfive
years after the first promise, when of these 430 years there now remained 405, which
God was pleased to call 400. No one will doubt that the other things which follow in the
prophetic words of God pertain to the people of Israel.</p>
<p>When it is added, “And when the sun was now setting there was a flame, and lo, a
smoking furnace, and lamps of fire, which passed through between those pieces,” this signifies
that at the end of the world the carnal shall be judged by fire. For just as the affliction of
the city of God, such as never was before, which is expected to take place under Antichrist,
was signified by Abraham’s horror of great darkness about the going down of the sun, that
is, when the end of the world draws nigh,—so at the going down of the sun, that is, at the
very end of the world, there is signified by that fire the day of judgment, which separates
the carnal who are to be saved by fire from those who are to be condemned in the fire. And
then the covenant made with Abraham particularly sets forth the land of Canaan, and names
eleven tribes in it from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates. It is not then
from the great river of Egypt, that is, the Nile, but from a small one which separates Egypt
from Palestine, where the city of Rhinocorura is.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Of Sarah’s Handmaid, Hagar, Whom She Herself Wished to Be Abraham’s
Concubine.</head>
<p>And here follow the times of Abraham’s sons, the one by Hagar the bond maid, the
other by Sarah the free woman, about whom we have already spoken in the previous book.
As regards this transaction, Abraham is in no way to be branded as guilty concerning this
concubine, for he used her for the begetting of progeny, not for the gratification of lust; and
not to insult, but rather to obey his wife, who supposed it would be solace of her barrenness
if she could make use of the fruitful womb of her handmaid to supply the defect of her own
nature, and by that law of which the apostle says, “Likewise also the husband hath not power
of his own body, but the wife,”918 could, as a wife, make use of him for childbearing by another,
when she could not do so in her own person. Here there is no wanton lust, no filthy
lewdness. The handmaid is delivered to the husband by the wife for the sake of progeny,
and is received by the husband for the sake of progeny, each seeking, not guilty excess, but
natural fruit. And when the pregnant bond woman despised her barren mistress, and Sarah,
with womanly jealousy, rather laid the blame of this on her husband, even then Abraham
showed that he was not a slavish lover, but a free begetter of children, and that in using
Hagar he had guarded the chastity of Sarah his wife, and had gratified her will and not his
own,—had received her without seeking, had gone in to her without being attached, had
impregnated without loving her,—for he says, “Behold thy maid is in thy hands: do to her
as it pleaseth thee;”919 a man able to use women as a man should,—his wife temperately,
his handmaid compliantly, neither intemperately!</p>

Now Old, of a Son by the Barren Sarah, and Appoints Him the Father of the
Nations, and Seals His Faith in the Promise by the Sacrament of Circumcision.</head>
<p>After these things Ishmael was born of Hagar; and Abraham might think that in him
was fulfilled what God had promised him, saying, when he wished to adopt his home-born
servant, “This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth of thee, he shall be thine
heir.”920 Therefore, lest he should think that what was promised was fulfilled in the handmaid’s
son, “when Abram was ninety years old and nine, God appeared to him, and said
unto him, I am God; be well-pleasing in my sight, and be without complaint, and I will make
my covenant between me and thee, and will fill thee exceedingly.”921</p>
<p>Here there are more distinct promises about the calling of the nations in Isaac, that is,
in the son of the promise, by which grace is signified, and not nature; for the son is promised
from an old man and a barren old woman. For although God effects even the natural course
of procreation, yet where the agency of God is manifest, through the decay or failure of
nature, grace is more plainly discerned. And because this was to be brought about, not by
generation, but by regeneration, circumcision was enjoined now, when a son was promised
of Sarah. And by ordering all, not only sons, but also home-born and purchased servants
to be circumcised, he testifies that this grace pertains to all. For what else does circumcision
signify than a nature renewed on the putting off of the old? And what else does the eighth
day mean than Christ, who rose again when the week was completed, that is, after the Sabbath?
The very names of the parents are changed: all things proclaim newness, and the
new covenant is shadowed forth in the old. For what does the term old covenant imply but
the concealing of the new? And what does the term new covenant imply but the revealing
of the old? The laughter of Abraham is the exultation of one who rejoices, not the scornful
laughter of one who mistrusts. And those words of his in his heart, “Shall a son be born to
me that am an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?” are not
the words of doubt, but of wonder. And when it is said, “And I will give to thee, and to thy
seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession,” if it troubles any one whether this is to be held as fulfilled, or whether its fulfilment
may still be looked for, since no kind of earthly possession can be everlasting for any
nation whatever, let him know that the word translated everlasting, by our writers is what
the Greeks term αἰώ·νιον, which is derived from αἰὼ·ν, the Greek for sæculum, an age.
But the Latins have not ventured to translate this by secular, lest they should change the
meaning into something widely different. For many things are called secular which so

<head>Chapter 27.—Of the Male, Who Was to Lose His Soul If He Was Not Circumcised
on the Eighth Day, Because He Had Broken God’s Covenant.</head>
<p>When it is said, “The male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul
shall be cut off from his people, because he hath broken my covenant,”922 some may be
troubled how that ought to be understood, since it can be no fault of the infant whose life
it is said must perish; nor has the covenant of God been broken by him, but by his parents,
who have not taken care to circumcise him. But even the infants, not personally in their
own life, but according to the common origin of the human race, have all broken God’s
covenant in that one in whom all have sinned.923 Now there are many things called God’s
covenants besides those two great ones, the old and the new, which any one who pleases
may read and know. For the first covenant, which was made with the first man, is just this:
“In the day ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die.”924 Whence it is written in the book called
Ecclesiasticus, “All flesh waxeth old as doth a garment. For the covenant from the beginning
is, Thou shall die the death.”925 Now, as the law was more plainly given afterward, and the
apostle says, “Where no law is, there is no prevarication,”926 on what supposition is what
is said in the psalm true, “I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,”927 except
that all who are held liable for any sin are accused of dealing deceitfully (prevaricating) with
some law? If on this account, then, even the infants are, according to the true belief, born
in sin, not actual but original, so that we confess they have need of grace for the remission
of sins, certainly it must be acknowledged that in the same sense in which they are sinners
they are also prevaricators of that law which was given in Paradise, according to the truth
of both scriptures, “I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,” and “Where no
law is, there is no prevarication.” And thus, be cause circumcision was the sign of regeneration,
and the infant, on account of the original sin by which God’s covenant was first
broken, was not undeservedly to lose his generation unless delivered by regeneration, these
divine words are to be understood as if it had been said, Whoever is not born again, that
soul shall perish from his people, because he hath broken my covenant, since he also has
sinned in Adam with all others. For had He said, Because he hath broken this my covenant,
He would have compelled us to understand by it only this of circumcision; but since He has
not expressly said what covenant the infant has broken, we are free to understand Him as
speaking of that covenant of which the breach can be ascribed to an infant. Yet if any one

contends that it is said of nothing else than circumcision, that in it the infant has broken
the covenant of God because, he is not circumcised, he must seek some method of explanation
by which it may be understood without absurdity (such as this) that he has broken the
covenant, because it has been broken in him although not by him. Yet in this case also it is
to be observed that the soul of the infant, being guilty of no sin of neglect against itself,
would perish unjustly, unless original sin rendered it obnoxious to punishment.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Of the Change of Name in Abraham and Sarah, Who Received the
Gift of Fecundity When They Were Incapable of Regeneration Owing to the
Barrenness of One, and the Old Age of Both.</head>
<p>Now when a promise so great and clear was made to Abraham, in which it was so plainly
said to him, “I have made thee a father of many nations, and I will increase thee exceedingly,
and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall go forth of thee. And I will give thee a son
of Sarah; and I will bless him, and he shall become nations, and kings of nations shall be of
him,”928—a promise which we now see fulfilled in Christ,—from that time forward this
couple are not called in Scripture, as formerly, Abram and Sarai, but Abraham and Sarah,
as we have called them from the first, for every one does so now. The reason why the name
of Abraham was changed is given: “For,” He says, “I have made thee a father of many nations.”
This, then, is to be understood to be the meaning of Abraham; but Abram, as he was
formerly called, means “exalted father.” The reason of the change of Sarah’s name is not
given; but as those say who have written interpretations of the Hebrew names contained in
these books, Sarah means “my princess,” and Sarai “strength.” Whence it is written in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, “Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive
seed.”929 For both were old, as the Scripture testifies; but she was also barren, and had
ceased to menstruate, so that she could no longer bear children even if she had not been
barren. Further, if a woman is advanced in years, yet still retains the custom of women, she
can bear children to a young man, but not to an old man, although that same old man can
beget, but only of a young woman; as after Sarah’s death Abraham could of Keturah, because
he met with her in her lively age. This, then, is what the apostle mentions as wonderful,
saying, besides, that Abraham’s body was now dead;930 because at that age he was no longer
able to beget children of any woman who retained now only a small part of her natural
vigor. Of course we must understand that his body was dead only to some purposes, not
to all; for if it was so to all, it would no longer be the aged body of a living man, but the
corpse of a dead one. Although that question, how Abraham begot children of Keturah, is
usually solved in this way, that the gift of begetting which he received from the Lord, remained
even after the death of his wife, yet I think that solution of the question which I have
followed is preferable, because, although in our days an old man of a hundred years can
beget children of no woman, it was not so then, when men still lived so long that a hundred
years did not yet bring on them the decrepitude of old age.</p>

<p>God appeared again to Abraham at the oak of Mamre in three men, who it is not to be
doubted were angels, although some think that one of them was Christ, and assert that He
was visible before He put on flesh. Now it belongs to the divine power, and invisible, incorporeal,
and incommutable nature, without changing itself at all, to appear even to mortal
men, not by what it is, but by what is subject to it. And what is not subject to it? Yet if they
try to establish that one of these three was Christ by the fact that, although he saw three, he
addressed the Lord in the singular, as it is written, “And, lo, three men stood by him: and,
when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent-door, and worshipped toward the
ground, and said, Lord, if I have found favor before thee,”931 etc.; why do they not advert
to this also, that when two of them came to destroy the Sodomites, while Abraham still
spoke to one, calling him Lord, and interceding that he would not destroy the righteous
along with the wicked in Sodom, Lot received these two in such a way that he too in his
conversation with them addressed the Lord in the singular? For after saying to them in the
plural, “Behold, my lords, turn aside into your servant’s house,”932 etc., yet it is afterwards
said, “And the angels laid hold upon his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of
his two daughters, because the Lord was merciful unto him. And it came to pass, whenever
they had led him forth abroad, that they said, Save thy life; look not behind thee, neither
stay thou in all this region: save thyself in the mountain, lest thou be caught. And Lot said
unto them, I pray thee, Lord, since thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,”933 etc. And
then after these words the Lord also answered him in the singular, although He was in two
angels, saying, “See, I have accepted thy face,”934 etc. This makes it much more credible
that both Abraham in the three men and Lot in the two recognized the Lord, addressing
Him in the singular number, even when they were addressing men; for they received them
as they did for no other reason than that they might minister human refection to them as
men who needed it. Yet there was about them something so excellent, that those who showed
them hospitality as men could not doubt that God was in them as He was wont to be in the
prophets, and therefore sometimes addressed them in the plural, and sometimes God in
them in the singular. But that they were angels the Scripture testifies, not only in this book
of Genesis, in which these transactions are related, but also in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
where in praising hospitality it is said, “For thereby some have entertained angels un-

awares.”935 By these three men, then, when a son Isaac was again promised to Abraham
by Sarah, such a divine oracle was also given that it was said, “Abraham shall become a great
and numerous nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him.”936 And here
these two things, are promised with the utmost brevity and fullness,—the nation of Israel
according to the flesh, and all nations according to faith.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—Of Lot’s Deliverance from Sodom, and Its Consumption by Fire from
Heaven; And of Abimelech, Whose Lust Could Not Harm Sarah’s Chastity.</head>
<p>After this promise Lot was delivered out of Sodom, and a fiery rain from heaven turned
into ashes that whole region of the impious city, where custom had made sodomy as prevalent
as laws have elsewhere made other kinds of wickedness. But this punishment of theirs was
a specimen of the divine judgment to come. For what is meant by the angels forbidding
those who were delivered to look back, but that we are not to look back in heart to the old
life which, being regenerated through grace, we have put off, if we think to escape the last
judgment? Lot’s wife, indeed, when she looked back, remained, and, being turned into salt,
furnished to believing men a condiment by which to savor somewhat the warning to be
drawn from that example. Then Abraham did again at Gerar, with Abimelech the king of
that city, what he had done in Egypt about his wife, and received her back untouched in the
same way. On this occasion, when the king rebuked Abraham for not saying she was his
wife, and calling her his sister, he explained what he had been afraid of, and added this further,
“And yet indeed she is my sister by the father’s side, but not by the mother’s;937 for she was
Abraham’s sister by his own father, and so near of kin. But her beauty was so great, that
even at that advanced age she could be fallen in love with.</p>

<p>After these things a son was born to Abraham, according to God’s promise, of Sarah,
and was called Isaac, which means laughter. For his father had laughed when he was
promised to him, in wondering delight, and his mother, when he was again promised by
those three men, had laughed, doubting for joy; yet she was blamed by the angel because
that laughter, although it was for joy, yet was not full of faith. Afterwards she was confirmed
in faith by the same angel. From this, then, the boy got his name. For when Isaac was born
and called by that name, Sarah showed that her laughter was not that of scornful reproach,
but that of joyful praise; for she said, “God hath made me to laugh, so that every one who
hears will laugh with me.”938 Then in a little while the bond maid was cast out of the house
with her son; and, according to the apostle, these two women signify the old and new covenants,—
Sarah representing that of the Jerusalem which is above, that is, the city of God.939</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—Of Abraham’s Obedience and Faith, Which Were Proved by the Offering
Up, of His Son in Sacrifice, and of Sarah’s Death.</head>
<p>Among other things, of which it would take too long time to mention the whole, Abraham
was tempted about the offering up of his well-beloved son Isaac, to prove his pious
obedience, and so make it known to the world, not to God. Now every temptation is not
blame-worthy; it may even be praise-worthy, because it furnishes probation. And, for the
most part, the human mind cannot attain to self-knowledge otherwise than by making trial
of its powers through temptation, by some kind of experimental and not merely verbal selfinterrogation;
when, if it has acknowledged the gift of God, it is pious, and is consolidated
by steadfast grace and not puffed up by vain boasting. Of course Abraham could never believe
that God delighted in human sacrifices; yet when the divine commandment thundered, it
was to be obeyed, not disputed. Yet Abraham is worthy of praise, because he all along believed
that his son, on being offered up, would rise again; for God had said to him, when he
was unwilling to fulfill his wife’s pleasure by casting out the bond maid and her son, “In
Isaac shall thy seed be called.” No doubt He then goes on to say, “And as for the son of this
bond woman, I will make him a great nation, because he is thy seed.”940 How then is it said
“In Isaac shall thy seed be called,” when God calls Ishmael also his seed? The apostle, in
explaining this, says, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called, that is, they which are the children
of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted
for the seed.”941 In order, then, that the children of the promise may be the seed of Abraham,
they are called in Isaac, that is, are gathered together in Christ by the call of grace. Therefore
the father, holding fast from the first the promise which behoved to be fulfilled through this
son whom God had ordered him to slay, did not doubt that he whom he once thought it
hopeless he should ever receive would be restored to him when he had offered him up. It
is in this way the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews is also to be understood and explained.
“By faith,” he says, “Abraham overcame, when tempted about Isaac: and he who had received
the promise offered up his only son, to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:
thinking that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead;” therefore he has added,
“from whence also he received him in a similitude.”942 In whose similitude but His of whom
the apostle says, “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all?”943 And
on this account Isaac also himself carried to the place of sacrifice the wood on which he was
to be offered up, just as the Lord Himself carried His own cross. Finally, since Isaac was
not to be slain, after his father was forbidden to smite him, who was that ram by the offering

<pb n="757"/>
of which that sacrifice was completed with typical blood? For when Abraham saw him, he
was caught by the horns in a thicket. What, then, did he represent but Jesus, who, before
He was offered up, was crowned with thorns by the Jews?</p>
<p>But let us rather hear the divine words spoken through the angel. For the Scripture
says, “And Abraham stretched forth his hand to take the knife, that he might slay his son.
And the Angel of the Lord called unto him from heaven, and said, Abraham. And he said,
Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto
him: for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy beloved son for my
sake.”944 It is said, “Now I know,” that is, Now I have made to be known; for God was not
previously ignorant of this. Then, having offered up that ram instead of Isaac his son,
“Abraham,” as we read, “called the name of that place The Lord seeth: as they say this day,
In the mount the Lord hath appeared.”945 As it is said, “Now I know,” for Now I have made
to be known, so here, “The Lord sees,” for The Lord hath appeared, that is, made Himself
to be seen. “And the Angel of the Lord called unto Abraham from heaven the second time,
saying, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; because thou hast done this thing, and hast
not spared thy beloved son for my sake; that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying
I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore;
and thy seed shall possess by inheritance the cities of the adversaries: and in thy seed shall
all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.”946 In this
manner is that promise concerning the calling of the nations in the seed of Abraham confirmed
even by the oath of God, after that burnt-offering which typified Christ. For He had
often promised, but never sworn. And what is the oath of God, the true and faithful, but a
confirmation of the promise, and a certain reproof to the unbelieving?</p>
<p>After these things Sarah died, in the 127th year of her life, and the 137th of her husband
for he was ten years older than she, as he himself says, when a son is promised to him by
her: “Shall a son be born to me that am an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety
years old, bear?”947 Then Abraham bought a field, in which he buried his wife. And then,
according to Stephen’s account, he was settled in that land, entering then on actual possession
of it,—that is, after the death of his father, who is inferred to have died two years before.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—What is Meant by Abraham’s Marrying Keturah After Sarah’s Death.</head>
<p>What did Abraham mean by marrying Keturah after Sarah’s death? Far be it from us
to suspect him of incontinence, especially when he had reached such an age and such sanctity
of faith. Or was he still seeking to beget children, though he held fast, with most approved
faith, the promise of God that his children should be multiplied out of Isaac as the stars of
heaven and the dust of the earth? And yet, if Hagar and Ishmael, as the apostle teaches us,
signified the carnal people of the old covenant, why may not Keturah and her sons also
signify the carnal people who think they belong to the new covenant? For both are called
both the wives and the concubines of Abraham; but Sarah is never called a concubine (but
only a wife). For when Hagar is given to Abraham, it is written. “And Sarai, Abram’s wife,
took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abraham had dwelt ten years in the land of
Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.”949 And of Keturah, whom he
took after Sarah’s departure, we read, “Then again Abraham took a wife, whose name was
Keturah.”950 Lo! both are called wives, yet both are found to have been concubines; for the
Scripture afterward says, “And Abraham gave his whole estate unto Isaac his son. But unto
the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from his son Isaac,
(while he yet lived,) eastward, unto the east country.”951 Therefore the sons of the concubines,
that is, the heretics and the carnal Jews, have some gifts, but do not attain the promised
kingdom; “For they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God:
but the children of the promise are counted for the seed, of whom it was said, In Isaac shall
thy seed be called.”952 For I do not see why Keturah, who was married after the wife’s death,
should be called a concubine, except on account of this mystery. But if any one is unwilling
to put such meanings on these things, he need not calumniate Abraham. For what if even
this was provided against the heretics who were to be the opponents of second marriages,
so that it might be shown that it was no sin in the case of the father of many nations himself,
when, after his wife’s death, he married again? And Abraham died when he was 175 years
old, so that he left his son Isaac seventy-five years old, having begotten him when 100 years
old.</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—What Was Indicated by the Divine Answer About the Twins Still Shut
Up in the Womb of Rebecca Their Mother.</head>
<p>Let us now see how the times of the city of God run on from this point among Abraham’s
descendants. In the time from the first year of Isaac’s life to the seventieth, when his sons
were born, the only memorable thing is, that when he prayed God that his wife, who was
barren, might bear, and the Lord granted what he sought, and she conceived, the twins leapt
while still enclosed in her womb. And when she was troubled by this struggle, and inquired
of the Lord, she received this answer: “Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of
people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall overcome the other
people, and the elder shall serve the younger.”953 The Apostle Paul would have us understand
this as a great instance of grace;954 for the children being not yet born, neither having done
any good or evil, the younger is chosen without any good desert and the elder is rejected,
when beyond doubt, as regards original sin, both were alike, and as regards actual sin, neither
had any. But the plan of the work on hand does not permit me to speak more fully of this
matter now, and I have said much about it in other works. Only that saying, “The elder
shall serve the younger,” is understood by our writers, almost without exception, to mean
that the elder people, the Jews, shall serve the younger people, the Christians. And truly,
although this might seem to be fulfilled in the Idumean nation, which was born of the elder
(who had two names, being called both Esau and Edom, whence the name Idumeans), because
it was afterwards to be overcome by the people which sprang from the younger, that is, by
the Israelites, and was to become subject to them; yet it is more suitable to believe that, when
it was said, “The one people shall overcome the other people, and the elder shall serve the
younger,” that prophecy meant some greater thing; and what is that except what is evidently
fulfilled in the Jews and Christians?</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—Of the Oracle and Blessing Which Isaac Received, Just as His Father
Did, Being Beloved for His Sake.</head>
<p>Isaac also received such an oracle as his father had often received. Of this oracle it is
thus written: “And there was a famine over the land, beside the first famine that was in the
days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. And
the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; but dwell in the land which
I shall tell thee of. And abide in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: unto
thee and unto thy seed I will give all this land; and I will establish mine oath, which I sware
unto Abraham thy father: and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give
unto thy seed all this land: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because
that Abraham thy father obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts, my commandments, my
righteousness, and my laws.”955 This patriarch neither had another wife, nor any concubine,
but was content with the twin-children begotten by one act of generation. He also was
afraid, when he lived among strangers, of being brought into danger owing to the beauty
of his wife, and did like his father in calling her his sister, and not telling that she was his
wife; for she was his near blood-relation by the father’s and mother’s side. She also remained
untouched by the strangers, when it was known she was his wife. Yet we ought not to prefer
him to his father because he knew no woman besides his one wife. For beyond doubt the
merits of his father’s faith and obedience were greater, inasmuch as God says it is for his
sake He does Isaac good: “In thy seed,” He says, “shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,
because that Abraham thy father obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts, my commandments,
my statutes, and my laws.” And again in another oracle He says, “I am the God of Abraham
thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my
servant Abraham’s sake.”956 So that we must understand how chastely Abraham acted,
because imprudent men, who seek some support for their own wickedness in the Holy
Scriptures, think he acted through lust. We may also learn this, not to compare men by
single good things, but to consider everything in each; for it may happen that one man has
something in his life and character in which he excels another, and it may be far more excellent
than that in which the other excels him. And thus, according to sound and true judgment,
while continence is preferable to marriage, yet a believing married man is better than
a continent unbeliever; for the unbeliever is not only less praiseworthy, but is even highly
detestable. We must conclude, then, that both are good; yet so as to hold that the married
man who is most faithful and most obedient is certainly better than the continent man
whose faith and obedience are less. But if equal in other things, who would hesitate to prefer
the continent man to the married?</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—Of the Things Mystically Prefigured in Esau and Jacob.</head>
<p>Isaac’s two sons, Esau and Jacob, grew up together. The primacy of the elder was
transferred to the younger by a bargain and agreement between them, when the elder immoderately
lusted after the lentiles the younger had prepared for food, and for that price
sold his birthright to him, confirming it with an oath. We learn from this that a person is
to be blamed, not for the kind of food he eats, but for immoderate greed. Isaac grew old,
and old age deprived him of his eyesight. He wished to bless the elder son, and instead of
the elder, who was hairy, unwittingly blessed the younger, who put himself under his father’s
hands, having covered himself with kid-skins, as if bearing the sins of others. Lest we should
think this guile of Jacob’s was fraudulent guile, instead of seeking in it the mystery of a great
thing, the Scripture has predicted in the words just before, “Esau was a cunning hunter, a
man of the field; and Jacob was a simple man, dwelling at home.”957 Some of our writers
have interpreted this, “without guile.” But whether the Greek ἄλαστος means “without
guile,” or “simple,” or rather “without reigning,” in the receiving of that blessing what is the
guile of the man without guile? What is the guile of the simple, what the fiction of the man
who does not lie, but a profound mystery of the truth? But what is the blessing itself? “See,”
he says, “the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field which the Lord hath blessed:
therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fruitfulness of the earth, and plenty
of corn and wine: let nations serve thee, and princes adore thee: and be lord of thy brethren,
and let thy father’s sons adore thee: cursed be he that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
blesseth thee.”958 The blessing of Jacob is therefore a proclamation of Christ to all nations.
It is this which has come to pass, and is now being fulfilled. Isaac is the law and the prophecy:
even by the mouth of the Jews Christ is blessed by prophecy as by one who knows not, because
it is itself not understood. The world like a field is filled with the odor of Christ’s
name: His is the blessing of the dew of heaven, that is, of the showers of divine words; and
of the fruitfulness of the earth, that is, of the gathering together of the peoples: His is the
plenty of corn and wine, that is, the multitude that gathers bread and wine in the sacrament
of His body and blood. Him the nations serve, Him princes adore. He is the Lord of His
brethren, because His people rules over the Jews. Him His Father’s sons adore, that is, the
sons of Abraham according to faith; for He Himself is the son of Abraham according to the
flesh. He is cursed that curseth Him, and he that blesseth Him is blessed. Christ, I say, who
is ours is blessed, that is, truly spoken of out of the mouths of the Jews, when, although
erring, they yet sing the law and the prophets, and think they are blessing another for whom
they erringly hope. So, when the elder son claims the promised blessing, Isaac is greatly
afraid, and wonders when he knows that he has blessed one instead of the other, and demands
<note type="footnote">957 Gen. xxv. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">958 Gen. xxvii. 27–29.</note>

<pb n="763"/>
who he is; yet he does not complain that he has been deceived, yea, when the great mystery
is revealed to him, in his secret heart he at once eschews anger, and confirms the blessing.
“Who then,” he says, “hath hunted me venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all
before thou camest, and have blessed him, and he shall be blessed?”959 Who would not
rather have expected the curse of an angry man here, if these things had been done in an
earthly manner, and not by inspiration from above? O things done, yet done prophetically;
on the earth, yet celestially; by men, yet divinely! If everything that is fertile of so great
mysteries should be examined carefully, many volumes would be filled; but the moderate
compass fixed for this work compels us to hasten to other things.</p>

<head>Chapter 38.—Of Jacob’s Mission to Mesopotamia to Get a Wife, and of the Vision
Which He Saw in a Dream by the Way, and of His Getting Four Women When
He Sought One Wife.</head>
<p>Jacob was sent by his parents to Mesopotamia that he might take a wife there. These
were his father’s words on sending him: “Thou shall not take a wife of the daughters of the
Canaanites. Arise, fly to Mesopotamia, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother’s father, and
take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother. And my God
bless thee, and increase thee, and multiply thee; and thou shalt be an assembly of peoples;
and give to thee the blessing of Abraham thy father, and to thy seed after thee; that thou
mayest inherit the land wherein thou dwellest, which God gave unto Abraham.”960 Now
we understand here that the seed of Jacob is separated from Isaac’s other seed which came
through Esau. For when it is said, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called,”961 by this seed is meant
solely the city of God; so that from it is separated Abraham’s other seed, which was in the
son of the bond woman, and which was to be in the sons of Keturah. But until now it had
been uncertain regarding Isaac’s twin-sons whether that blessing belonged to both or only
to one of them; and if to one, which of them it was. This is now declared when Jacob is
prophetically blessed by his father, and it is said to him, “And thou shalt be an assembly of
peoples, and God give to thee the blessing of Abraham thy father.”</p>
<p>When Jacob was going to Mesopotamia, he received in a dream an oracle, of which it
is thus written: “And Jacob went out from the well of the oath,962 and went to Haran. And
he came to a place, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he took of the stones of the place,
and put them at his head, and slept in that place, and dreamed. And behold a ladder set up
on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and the angels of God ascended and descended
by it. And the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father,
and the God of Isaac; fear not: the land whereon thou sleepest, to thee will I give it, and to
thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and it shall be spread abroad to the
sea, and to Africa, and to the north, and to the east: and all the tribes of the earth shall be
blessed in thee and in thy seed. And, behold, I am with thee, to keep thee in all thy way
wherever thou goest, and I will bring thee back into this land; for I will not leave thee, until
I have done all which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awoke out of his sleep, and said,
Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How
dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
And Jacob arose, and took the stone that he had put under his head there, and set it up for
a memorial, and poured oil upon the top of it. And Jacob called the name of that place the
<note type="footnote">960 Gen. xxviii. 1–4.</note>
<note type="footnote">961 Gen. xxi. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">962 Beer-sheba.</note>

<pb n="765"/>
house of God.”963 This is prophetic. For Jacob did not pour oil on the stone in an idolatrous
way, as if making it a god; neither did he adore that stone, or sacrifice to it. But since the
name of Christ comes from the chrism or anointing, something pertaining to the great
mystery was certainly represented in this. And the Saviour Himself is understood to bring
this latter to remembrance in the gospel, when He says of Nathanael, “Behold an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no guile!”964 because Israel who saw this vision is no other than Jacob.
And in the same place He says, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see heaven open, and
the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.”</p>
<p>Jacob went on to Mesopotamia to take a wife from thence. And the divine Scripture
points out how, without unlawfully desiring any of them, he came to have four women, of
whom he begat twelve sons and one daughter; for he had come to take only one. But when
one was falsely given him in place of the other, he did not send her away after unwittingly
using her in the night, lest he should seem to have put her to shame; but as at that time, in
order to multiply posterity, no law forbade a plurality of wives, he took her also to whom
alone he had promised marriage. As she was barren, she gave her handmaid to her husband
that she might have children by her; and her elder sister did the same thing in imitation of
her, although she had borne, because she desired to multiply progeny. We do not read that
Jacob sought any but one, or that he used many, except for the purpose of begetting offspring,
saving conjugal rights; and he would not have done this, had not his wives, who had legitimate
power over their own husband’s body, urged him to do it. So he begat twelve sons
and one daughter by four women. Then he entered into Egypt by his son Joseph, who was
sold by his brethren for envy, and carried there, and who was there exalted.</p>

<head>Chapter 39.—The Reason Why Jacob Was Also Called Israel.</head>
<p>As I said a little ago, Jacob was also called Israel, the name which was most prevalent
among the people descended from him. Now this name was given him by the angel who
wrestled with him on the way back from Mesopotamia, and who was most evidently a type
of Christ. For when Jacob overcame him, doubtless with his own consent, that the mystery
might be represented, it signified Christ’s passion, in which the Jews are seen overcoming
Him. And yet he besought a blessing from the very angel he had overcome; and so the imposition
of this name was the blessing. For Israel means seeing God,965 which will at last be
the reward of all the saints. The angel also touched him on the breadth of the thigh when
he was overcoming him, and in that way made him lame. So that Jacob was at one and the
same time blessed and lame: blessed in those among that people who believed in Christ,
and lame in the unbelieving. For the breadth of the thigh is the multitude of the family.
For there are many of that race of whom it was prophetically said beforehand, “And they
have halted in their paths.”966</p>

<head>Chapter 40.—How It is Said that Jacob Went into Egypt with Seventy-Five Souls,
When Most of Those Who are Mentioned Were Born at a Later Period.</head>
<p>Seventy-five men are reported to have entered Egypt along with Jacob, counting him
with his children. In this number only two women are mentioned, one a daughter, the
other a grand-daughter. But when the thing is carefully considered, it does not appear that
Jacob’s offspring was so numerous on the day or year when he entered Egypt. There are
also included among them the great-grandchildren of Joseph, who could not possibly be
born already. For Jacob was then 130 years old, and his son Joseph thirty-nine and as it is
plain that he took a wife when he was thirty or more, how could he in nine years have greatgrandchildren
by the children whom he had by that wife? Now since, Ephraim and Manasseh,
the sons of Joseph, could not even have children, for Jacob found them boys under nine
years old when he entered Egypt, in what way are not only their sons but their grandsons
reckoned among those seventy-five who then entered Egypt with Jacob? For there is reckoned
there Machir the son of Manasseh, grandson of Joseph, and Machir’s son, that is, Gilead,
grandson of Manasseh, great-grandson of Joseph; there, too, is he whom Ephraim, Joseph’s
other son, begot, that is, Shuthelah, grandson of Joseph, and Shuthelah’s son Ezer, grandson
of Ephraim, and great-grand-son of Joseph, who could not possibly be in existence when
Jacob came into Egypt, and there found his grandsons, the sons of Joseph, their grandsires,
still boys under nine years of age.967 But doubtless, when the Scripture mentions Jacob’s
entrance into Egypt with seventy-five souls, it does not mean one day, or one year, but that
whole time as long as Joseph lived, who was the cause of his entrance. For the same Scripture
speaks thus of Joseph: “And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his brethren, and all his father’s
house: and Joseph lived 110 years, and saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation.”968
That is, his great-grandson, the third from Ephraim; for the third generation means son,
grandson, great-grandson. Then it is added, “The children also of Machir, the son of
Manasseh, were born upon Joseph’s knees.”969 And this is that grandson of Manasseh, and
great-grandson of Joseph. But the plural number is employed according to scriptural usage;
for the one daughter of Jacob is spoken of as daughters, just as in the usage of the Latin
tongue liberi is used in the plural for children even when there is only one. Now, when
Joseph’s own happiness is proclaimed, because he could see his great-grandchildren, it is
by no means to be thought they already existed in the thirty-ninth year of their greatgrandsire
Joseph, when his father Jacob came to him in Egypt. But those who diligently
look into these things will the less easily be mistaken, because it is written, “These are the

Ephraim, and at ver. 27 gives the whole number as seventy-five. 1 Gen. l. 22, 23.</note>

<pb n="768"/>
names of the sons of Israel who entered into Egypt along with Jacob their father.”970 For
this means that the seventy-five are reckoned along with him, not that they were all with
him when he entered Egypt; for, as I have said, the whole period during which Joseph, who
occasioned his entrance, lived, is held to be the time of that entrance.</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—Of the Blessing Which Jacob Promised in Judah His Son.</head>
<p>If, on account of the Christian people in whom the city of God sojourns in the earth,
we look for the flesh of Christ in the seed of Abraham, setting aside the sons of the concubines,
we have Isaac; if in the seed of Isaac, setting aside Esau, who is also Edom, we have
Jacob, who also is Israel; if in the seed of Israel himself, setting aside the rest, we have Judah,
because Christ sprang of the tribe of Judah. Let us hear, then, how Israel, when dying in
Egypt, in blessing his sons, prophetically blessed Judah. He says: “Judah, thy brethren shall
praise thee: thy hands shall be on the back of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall adore
thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the sprouting, my son, thou art gone up: lying down,
thou hast slept as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp; who shall awake him? A prince shall not be
lacking out of Judah, and a leader from his thighs, until the things come that are laid up for
him; and He shall be the expectation of the nations. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his
ass’s foal to the choice vine; he shall wash his robe in wine, and his clothes in the blood of
the grape: his eyes are red with wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk.”971 I have expounded
these words in disputing against Faustus the Manichæan; and I think it is enough
to make the truth of this prophecy shine, to remark that the death of Christ is predicted by
the word about his lying down, and not the necessity, but the voluntary character of His
death, in the title of lion. That power He Himself proclaims in the gospel, saying, “I have
the power of laying down my life, and I have the power of taking it again. No man taketh
it from me; but I lay it down of myself, and take it again.”972 So the lion roared, so He fulfilled
what He said. For to this power what is added about the resurrection refers, “Who shall
awake him?” This means that no man but Himself has raised Him, who also said of His
own body, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”973 And the very nature
of His death, that is, the height of the cross, is understood by the single words “Thou are
gone up.” The evangelist explains what is added, “Lying down, thou hast slept,” when he
says, “He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.”974 Or at least His burial is to be understood,
in which He lay down sleeping, and whence no man raised Him, as the prophets did
some, and as He Himself did others; but He Himself rose up as if from sleep. As for His
robe which He washes in wine, that is, cleanses from sin in His own blood, of which blood
those who are baptized know the mystery, so that he adds, “And his clothes in the blood of
the grape,” what is it but the Church? “And his eyes are red with wine,” [these are] His
spiritual people drunken with His cup, of which the psalm sings, “And thy cup that makes

drunken, how excellent it is!” “And his teeth are whiter than milk,”975—that is, the nutritive
words which, according to the apostle, the babes drink, being as yet unfit for solid food.976
And it is He in whom the promises of Judah were laid up, so that until they come, princes,
that is, the kings of Israel, shall never be lacking out of Judah. “And He is the expectation
of the nations.” This is too plain to need exposition.</p>

<head>Chapter 42.—Of the Sons of Joseph, Whom Jacob Blessed, Prophetically Changing
His Hands.</head>
<p>Now, as Isaac’s two sons, Esau and Jacob, furnished a type of the two people, the Jews
and the Christians (although as pertains to carnal descent it was not the Jews but the
Idumeans who came of the seed of Esau, nor the Christian nations but rather the Jews who
came of Jacob’s; for the type holds only as regards the saying, “The elder shall serve the
younger”977), so the same thing happened in Joseph’s two sons; for the elder was a type of
the Jews, and the younger of the Christians. For when Jacob was blessing them, and laid
his right hand on the younger, who was at his left, and his left hand on the elder, who was
at his right, this seemed wrong to their father, and he admonished his father by trying to
correct his mistake and show him which was the elder. But he would not change his hands,
but said, “I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be exalted;
but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of
nations.”978 And these two promises show the same thing. For that one is to become “a
people;” this one “a multitude of nations.” And what can be more evident than that these
two promises comprehend the people of Israel, and the whole world of Abraham’s seed, the
one according to the flesh, the other according to faith?</p>

<head>Chapter 43.—Of the Times of Moses and Joshua the Son of Nun, of the Judges, and
Thereafter of the Kings, of Whom Saul Was the First, But David is to Be Regarded
as the Chief, Both by the Oath and by Merit.</head>
<p>Jacob being dead, and Joseph also, during the remaining 144 years until they went out
of the land of Egypt, that nation increased to an incredible degree, even although wasted by
so great persecutions, that at one time the male children were murdered at their birth, because
the wondering Egyptians were terrified at the too great increase of that people. Then Moses,
being stealthily kept from the murderers of the infants, was brought to the royal house, God
preparing to do great things by him, and was nursed and adopted by the daughter of Pharaoh
(that was the name of all the kings of Egypt), and became so great a man that he—yea, rather
God, who had promised this to Abraham, by him—drew that nation, so wonderfully multiplied,
out of the yoke of hardest and most grievous servitude it had borne there. At first,
indeed, he fled thence (we are told he fled into the land of Midian), because, in defending
an Israelite, he had slain an Egyptian, and was afraid. Afterward, being divinely commissioned
in the power of the Spirit of God, he overcame the magi of Pharaoh who resisted
him. Then, when the Egyptians would not let God’s people go, ten memorable plagues were
brought by Him upon them,—the water turned into blood, the frogs and lice, the flies, the
death of the cattle, the boils, the hail, the locusts, the darkness, the death of the first-born.
At last the Egyptians were destroyed in the Red Sea while pursuing the Israelites, whom
they had let go when at length they were broken by so many great plagues. The divided
sea made a way for the Israelites who were departing, but, returning on itself, it overwhelmed
their pursuers with its waves. Then for forty years the people of God went through the
desert, under the leadership of Moses, when the tabernacle of testimony was dedicated, in
which God was worshipped by sacrifices prophetic of things to come, and that was after the
law had been very terribly given in the mount, for its divinity was most plainly attested by
wonderful signs and voices. This took place soon after the exodus from Egypt, when the
people had entered the desert, on the fiftieth day after the passover was celebrated by the
offering up of a lamb, which is so completely a type of Christ, foretelling that through His
sacrificial passion He should go from this world to the Father (for pascha in, the Hebrew
tongue means transit), that when the new covenant was revealed, after Christ our passover
was offered up, the Holy Spirit came from heaven on the fiftieth day; and He is called in the
gospel the Finger of God, because He recalls to our remembrance the things done before
by way of types, and because the tables of that law are said to have been written by the finger
of God.</p>
<p>On the death of Moses, Joshua the son of Nun ruled the people, and led them into the
land of promise, and divided it among them. By these two wonderful leaders wars were
also carried on most prosperously and wonderfully, God calling to witness that they had

<pb n="773"/>
got these victories not so much on account of the merit of the Hebrew people as on account
of the sins of the nations they subdued. After these leaders there were judges, when the
people were settled in the land of promise, so that, in the meantime, the first promise made
to Abraham began to be fulfilled about the one nation, that is, the Hebrew, and about the
land of Canaan; but not as yet the promise about all nations, and the whole wide world, for
that was to be fulfilled, not by the observances of the old law, but by the advent of Christ in
the flesh, and by the faith of the gospel. And it was to prefigure this that it was not Moses,
who received the law for the people on Mount Sinai, that led the people into the land of
promise, but Joshua, whose name also was changed at God’s command, so that he was called
Jesus. But in the times of the judges prosperity alternated with adversity in war, according
as the sins of the people and the mercy of God were displayed.</p>
<p>We come next to the times of the kings. The first who reigned was Saul; and when he
was rejected and laid low in battle, and his offspring rejected so that no kings should arise
out of it, David succeeded to the kingdom, whose son Christ is chiefly called. He was made
a kind of starting-point and beginning of the advanced youth of God’s people, who had
passed a kind of age of puberty from Abraham to this David. And it is not in vain that the
evangelist Matthew records the generations in such a way as to sum up this first period from
Abraham to David in fourteen generations. For from the age of puberty man begins to be
capable of generation; therefore he starts the list of generations from Abraham, who also
was made the father of many nations when he got his name changed. So that previously
this family of God’s people was in its childhood, from Noah to Abraham; and for that reason
the first language was then learned, that is, the Hebrew. For man begins to speak in childhood,
the age succeeding infancy, which is so termed because then he cannot speak.979 And
that first age is quite drowned in oblivion, just as the first age of the human race was blotted
out by the flood; for who is there that can remember his infancy? Wherefore in this progress
of the city of God, as the previous book contained that first age, so this one ought to contain
the second and third ages, in which third age, as was shown by the heifer of three years old,
the she-goat of three years old, and the ram of three years old, the yoke of the law was imposed,
and there appeared abundance of sins, and the beginning of the earthly kingdom
arose, in which there were not lacking spiritual men, of whom the turtledove and pigeon
represented the mystery.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Of the Prophetic Age.</head>
<p>By the favor of God we have treated distinctly of His promises made to Abraham, that
both the nation of Israel according to the flesh, and all nations according to faith, should
be his seed, and the City of God, proceeding according to the order of time, will point980
out how they were fulfilled. Having therefore in the previous book come down to the reign
of David, we shall now treat of what remains, so far as may seem sufficient for the object of
this work, beginning at the same reign. Now, from the time when holy Samuel began to
prophesy, and ever onward until the people of Israel was led captive into Babylonia, and
until, according to the prophecy of holy Jeremiah, on Israel’s return thence after seventy
years, the house of God was built anew, this whole period is the prophetic age. For although
both the patriarch Noah himself, in whose days the whole earth was destroyed by the flood,
and others before and after him down to this time when there began to be kings over the
people of God, may not underservedly be styled prophets, on account of certain things
pertaining to the city of God and the kingdom of heaven, which they either predicted or in
any way signified should come to pass, and especially since we read that some of them, as
Abraham and Moses, were expressly so styled, yet those are most and chiefly called the days
of the prophets from the time when Samuel began to prophesy, who at God’s command
first anointed Saul to be king, and, on his rejection, David himself, whom others of his issue
should succeed as long as it was fitting they should do so. If, therefore, I wished to rehearse
all that the prophets have predicted concerning Christ, while the city of God, with its
members dying and being born in constant succession, ran its course through those times,
this work would extend beyond all bounds. First, because the Scripture itself, even when,
in treating in order of the kings and of their deeds and the events of their reigns, it seems
to be occupied in narrating as with historical diligence the affairs transacted, will be found,
if the things handled by it are considered with the aid of the Spirit of God, either more, or
certainly not less, intent on foretelling things to come than on relating things past. And
who that thinks even a little about it does not know how laborious and prolix a work it
would be, and how many volumes it would require to search this out by thorough investigation
and demonstrate it by argument? And then, because of that which without dispute
pertains to prophecy, there are so many things concerning Christ and the kingdom of
heaven, which is the city of God, that to explain these a larger discussion would be necessary
than the due proportion of this work admits of. Therefore I shall, if I can, so limit myself,
that in carrying through this work, I may, with God’s help, neither say what is superfluous
nor omit what is necessary.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—At What Time the Promise of God Was Fulfilled Concerning the Land
of Canaan, Which Even Carnal Israel Got in Possession.</head>
<p>In the preceding book we said, that in the promise of God to Abraham two things were
promised from the beginning, the one, name ly, that his seed should possess the land of
Canaan, which was intimated when it was said, “Go into a land that I will show thee, and I
will make of thee a great nation;”981 but the other far more excellent, concerning not the
carnal but the spiritual seed, by which he is the father, not of the one nation of Israel, but
of all nations who follow the footsteps of his faith, which began to be promised in these
words, “And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”982 And thereafter we showed
by yet many other proofs that these two things were promised. Therefore the seed of Abraham,
that is, the people of Israel according to the flesh, already was in the land of promise;
and there, not only by holding and possessing the cities of the enemies, but also by having
kings, had already begun to reign, the promises of God concerning that people being already
in great part fulfilled: not only those that were made to those three fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and whatever others were made in their times, but those also that were made
through Moses himself, by whom the same people was set free from servitude in Egypt, and
by whom all bygone things were revealed in his times, when he led the people through the
wilderness. But neither by the illustrious leader Jesus the son of Nun, who led that people
into the land of promise, and, after driving out the nations, divided it among the twelve
tribes according to God’s command, and died; nor after him, in the whole time of the judges,
was the promise of God concerning the land of Canaan fulfilled, that it should extend from
some river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates; nor yet was it still prophesied as to
come, but its fulfillment was expected. And it was fulfilled through David, and Solomon
his son, whose kingdom was extended over the whole promised space; for they subdued all
those nations, and made them tributary. And thus, under those kings, the seed of Abraham
was established in the land of promise according to the flesh, that is, in the land of Canaan,
so that nothing yet remained to the complete fulfillment of that earthly promise of God,
except that, so far as pertains to temporal prosperity, the Hebrew nation should remain in
the same land by the succession of posterity in an unshaken state even to the end of this
mortal age, if it obeyed the laws of the Lord its God. But since God knew it would not do
this, He used His temporal punishments also for training His few faithful ones in it, and for
giving needful warning to those who should afterwards be in all nations, in whom the other
promise, revealed in the New Testament, was about to be fulfilled through the incarnation
of Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Of the Three-Fold Meaning of the Prophecies, Which are to Be Referred
Now to the Earthly, Now to the Heavenly Jerusalem, and Now Again to Both.</head>
<p>Wherefore just as that divine oracle to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the other
prophetic signs or sayings which are given in the earlier sacred writings, so also the other
prophecies from this time of the kings pertain partly to the nation of Abraham’s flesh, and
partly to that seed of his in which all nations are blessed as fellow-heirs of Christ by the New
Testament, to the possessing of eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore they
pertain partly to the bond maid who gendereth to bondage, that is, the earthly Jerusalem,
which is in bondage with her children; but partly to the free city of God, that is, the true
Jerusalem eternal in the heavens, whose children are all those that live according to God in
the earth: but there are some things among them which are understood to pertain to
both,—to the bond maid properly, to the free woman figuratively.983</p>
<p>Therefore prophetic utterances of three kinds are to be found; forasmuch as there are
some relating to the earthly Jerusalem, some to the heavenly, and some to both. I think it
proper to prove what I say by examples. The prophet Nathan was sent to convict king
David of heinous sin, and predict to him what future evils should be consequent on it. Who
can question that this and the like pertain to the terrestrial city, whether publicly, that is,
for the safety or help of the people, or privately, when there are given forth for each one’s
private good divine utterances whereby something of the future may be known for the use
of temporal life? But where we read, “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make
for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah, a new testament: not according to the
testament that I settled for their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to lead
them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my testament, and I regarded
them not, saith the Lord. For this is the testament that I will make for the house of Israel:
after those days, saith the Lord, I will give my laws in their mind, and will write them upon
their hearts, and I will see to them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
people;”984—without doubt this is prophesied to the Jerusalem above, whose reward is God
Himself, and whose chief and entire good it is to have Him, and to be His. But this pertains
to both, that the city of God is called Jerusalem, and that it is prophesied the house of God
shall be in it; and this prophecy seems to be fulfilled when king Solomon builds that most
noble temple. For these things both happened in the earthly Jerusalem, as history shows,
and were types of the heavenly Jerusalem. And this kind of prophecy, as it were compacted
and commingled of both the others in the ancient canonical books, containing historical
narratives, is of very great significance, and has exercised and exercises greatly the wits of
those who search holy writ. For example, what we read of historically as predicted and ful-
<note type="footnote">983 Gal. iv. 22–31.</note>
<note type="footnote">984 Heb. viii. 8–10.</note>

<pb n="778"/>
filled in the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, we must also inquire the allegorical
meaning of, as it is to be fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to faith. And so much
is this the case, that some have thought there is nothing in these books either foretold and
effected, or effected although not foretold, that does not insinuate something else which is
to be referred by figurative signification to the city of God on high, and to her children who
are pilgrims in this life. But if this be so, then the utterances of the prophets, or rather the
whole of those Scriptures that are reckoned under the title of the Old Testament, will be not
of three, but of two different kinds. For there will be nothing there which pertains to the
terrestrial Jerusalem only, if whatever is there said and fulfilled of or concerning her signifies
something which also refers by allegorical prefiguration to the celestial Jerusalem; but there
will be only two kinds one that pertains to the free Jerusalem, the other to both. But just as,
I think, they err greatly who are of opinion that none of the records of affairs in that kind
of writings mean anything more than that they so happened, so I think those very daring
who contend that the whole gist of their contents lies in allegorical significations. Therefore
I have said they are threefold, not two-fold. Yet, in holding this opinion, I do not blame
those who may be able to draw out of everything there a spiritual meaning, only saving, first
of all, the historical truth. For the rest, what believer can doubt that those things are spoken
vainly which are such that, whether said to have been done or to be yet to come, they do
not beseem either human or divine affairs? Who would not recall these to spiritual understanding
if he could, or confess that they should be recalled by him who is able?</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—About the Prefigured Change of the Israelitic Kingdom and Priesthood,
and About the Things Hannah the Mother of Samuel Prophesied, Personating
the Church.</head>
<p>Therefore the advance of the city of God, where it reached the times of the kings, yielded
a figure, when, on the rejection of Saul, David first obtained the kingdom on such a footing
that thenceforth his descendants should reign in the earthly Jerusalem in continual succession;
for the course of affairs signified and foretold, what is not to be passed by in silence, concerning
the change of things to come, what belongs to both Testaments, the Old and the
New,—where the priesthood and kingdom are changed by one who is a priest, and at the
same time a king, new and everlasting, even Christ Jesus. For both the substitution in the
ministry of God, on Eli’s rejection as priest, of Samuel, who executed at once the office of
priest and judge, and the establishment of David in the kingdom, when Saul was rejected,
typified this of which I speak. And Hannah herself, the mother of Samuel, who formerly
was barren, and afterwards was gladdened with fertility, does not seem to prophesy anything
else, when she exultingly pours forth her thanksgiving to the Lord, on yielding up to God
the same boy she had born and weaned with the same piety with which she had vowed him.
For she says, “My heart is made strong in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God; my
mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; I am made glad in Thy salvation. Because there is
none holy as the Lord; and none is righteous as our God: there is none holy save Thee. Do
not glory so proudly, and do not speak lofty things, neither let vaunting talk come out of
your mouth; for a God of knowledge is the Lord, and a God preparing His curious designs.
The bow of the mighty hath He made weak, and the weak are girded with strength. They
that were full of bread are diminished; and the hungry have passed beyond the earth: for
the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. The Lord
killeth and maketh alive: He bringeth down to hell, and bringeth up again. The Lord maketh
poor and maketh rich: He bringeth low and lifteth up. He raiseth up the poor out of the
dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, that He may set him among the mighty
of [His] people, and maketh them inherit the throne of glory; giving the vow to him that
voweth, and He hath blessed the years of the just: for man is not mighty in strength. The
Lord shall make His adversary weak: the Lord is holy. Let not the prudent glory in his
prudence and let not the mighty glory in his might; and let not the rich glory in his riches:
but let him that glorieth glory in this, to understand and know the Lord, and to do judgment
and justice in the midst of the earth. The Lord hath ascended into the heavens, and hath
thundered: He shall judge the ends of the earth, for He is righteous: and He giveth strength
to our kings, and shall exalt the horn of His Christ.”985</p>

<p>Do you say that these are the words of a single weak woman giving thanks for the birth
of a son? Can the mind of men be so much averse to the light of truth as not to perceive
that the sayings this woman pours forth exceed her measure? Moreover, he who is suitably
interested in these things which have already begun to be fulfilled even in this earthly pilgrimage
also, does he not apply his mind, and perceive, and acknowledge, that through this
woman—whose very name, which is Hannah, means “His grace”—the very Christian religion,
the very city of God, whose king and founder is Christ, in fine, the very grace of God, hath
thus spoken by the prophetic Spirit, whereby the proud are cut off so that they fall, and the
humble are filled so that they rise, which that hymn chiefly celebrates? Unless perchance
any one will say that this woman prophesied nothing, but only lauded God with exulting
praise on account of the son whom she had obtained in answer to prayer. What then does
she mean when she says, “The bow of the mighty hath He made weak, and the weak are
girded with strength; they that were full of bread are diminished, and the hungry have gone
beyond the earth; for the barren hath born seven, and she that hath many children is waxed
feeble?” Had she herself born seven, although she had been barren? She had only one when
she said that; neither did she bear seven afterwards, nor six, with whom Samuel himself
might be the seventh, but three males and two females. And then, when as yet no one was
king over that people, whence, if she did not prophesy, did she say what she puts at the end,
“He giveth strength to our kings, and shall exalt the horn of His Christ?”</p>
<p>Therefore let the Church of Christ, the city of the great King,986 full of grace, prolific
of offspring, let her say what the prophecy uttered about her so long before by the mouth
of this pious mother confesses, “My heart is made strong in the Lord, and my horn is exalted
in my God.” Her heart is truly made strong, and her horn is truly exalted, because not in
herself, but in the Lord her God. “My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;” because even
in pressing straits the word of God is not bound, not even in preachers who are bound.987
“I am made glad,” she says, “in Thy salvation.” This is Christ Jesus Himself, whom old
Simeon, as we read in the Gospel, embracing as a little one, yet recognizing as great, said,
“Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.”
988 Therefore may the Church say, “I am made glad in Thy salvation. For there is
none holy as the Lord, and none is righteous as our God;” as holy and sanctifying, just and
justifying.989 “There is none holy beside Thee;” because no one becomes so except by
reason of Thee. And then it follows, “Do not glory so proudly, and do not speak lofty things,
neither let vaunting talk come out of your mouth. For a God of knowledge is the Lord.”

He knows you even when no one knows; for “he who thinketh himself to be something
when he is nothing deceiveth himself.”990 These things are said to the adversaries of the
city of God who belong to Babylon, who presume in their own strength, and glory in
themselves, not in the Lord; of whom are also the carnal Israelites, the earth-born inhabitants
of the earthly Jerusalem, who, as saith the apostle, “being ignorant of the righteousness of
God,”991 that is, which God, who alone is just, and the justifier, gives to man, “and wishing
to establish their own,” that is, which is as it were procured by their own selves, not bestowed
by Him, “are not subject to the righteousness of God,” just because they are proud, and
think they are able to please God with their own, not with that which is of God, who is the
God of knowledge, and therefore also takes the oversight of consciences, there beholding
the thoughts of men that they are vain,992 if they are of men, and are not from Him. “And
preparing,” she says, “His curious designs.” What curious designs do we think these are,
save that the proud must fall, and the humble rise? These curious designs she recounts,
saying, “The bow of the mighty is made weak, and the weak are girded with strength.” The
bow is made weak, that is, the intention of those who think themselves so powerful, that
without the gift and help of God they are able by human sufficiency to fulfill the divine
commandments; and those are girded with strength whose in ward cry is, “Have mercy
upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.”993</p>
<p>“They that were full of bread,” she says, “are diminished, and the hungry have gone
beyond the earth.” Who are to be understood as full of bread except those same who were
as if mighty, that is, the Israelites, to whom were committed the oracles of God?994 But
among that people the children of the bond maid were diminished,—by which word minus,
although it is Latin, the idea is well expressed that from being greater they were made
less,—because, even in the very bread, that is, the divine oracles, which the Israelites alone
of all nations have received, they savor earthly things. But the nations to whom that law
was not given, after they have come through the New Testament to these oracles, by thirsting
much have gone beyond the earth, because in them they have savored not earthly, but
heavenly things. And the reason why this is done is as it were sought; “for the barren,” she
says, “hath born seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.” Here all that had
been prophesied hath shone forth to those who understood the number seven, which signifies
the perfection of the universal Church. For which reason also the Apostle John writes to
the seven churches,995 showing in that way that he writes to the totality of the one Church;

and in the Proverbs of Solomon it is said aforetime, prefiguring this, “Wisdom hath builded
her house, she hath strengthened her seven pillars.”996 For the city of God was barren in
all nations before that child arose whom we see.997 We also see that the temporal Jerusalem,
who had many children, is now waxed feeble. Because, whoever in her were sons of the free
woman were her strength; but now, forasmuch as the letter is there, and not the spirit,
having lost her strength, she is waxed feeble.</p>
<p>“The Lord killeth and maketh alive:” He has killed her who had many children, and
made this barren one alive, so that she has born seven. Although it may be more suitably
understood that He has made those same alive whom He has killed. For she, as it were, repeats
that by adding, “He bringeth down to hell, and bringeth up.” To whom truly the
apostle says, “If ye be dead with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ
sitteth on the right hand of God.”998 Therefore they are killed by the Lord in a salutary way,
so that he adds, “Savor things which are above, not things on the earth;” so that these are
they who, hungering, have passed beyond the earth. “For ye are dead,” he says: behold how
God savingly kills! Then there follows, “And your life is hid with Christ in God:” behold
how God makes the same alive! But does He bring them down to hell and bring them up
again? It is without controversy among believers that we best see both parts of this work
fulfilled in Him, to wit our Head, with whom the apostle has said our life is hid in God.
“For when He spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,”999 in that way,
certainly, He has killed Him. And forasmuch as He raised Him up again from the dead, He
has made Him alive again. And since His voice is acknowledged in the prophecy, “Thou
wilt not leave my soul in hell,”1000 He has brought Him down to hell and brought Him up
again. By this poverty of His we are made rich;1001 for “the Lord maketh poor and maketh
rich.” But that we may know what this is, let us hear what follows: “He bringeth low and
lifteth up;” and truly He humbles the proud and exalts the humble. Which we also read
elsewhere, “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.”1002 This is the burden
of the entire song of this woman whose name is interpreted “His grace.”</p>
<p>Farther, what is added, “He raiseth up the poor from the earth,” I understand of none
better than of Him who, as was said a little ago, “was made poor for us, when He was rich,
that by His poverty we might be made rich.” For He raised Him from the earth so quickly

that His flesh did not see corruption. Nor shall I divert from Him what is added, “And
raiseth up the poor from the dunghill.” For indeed he who is the poor man is also the beggar.
1003 But by the dunghill from which he is lifted up we are with the greatest reason to
understand the persecuting Jews, of whom the apostle says, when telling that when he belonged
to them he persecuted the Church, “What things were gain to me, those I counted
loss for Christ; and I have counted them not only loss, but even dung, that I might win
Christ.”1004 Therefore that poor one is raised up from the earth above all the rich, and that
beggar is lifted up from that dunghill above all the wealthy, “that he may sit among the
mighty of the people,” to whom He says, “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones,”1005 “and to
make them inherit the throne of glory.” For these mighty ones had said, “Lo, we have forsaken
all and followed Thee.” They had most mightily vowed this vow.</p>
<p>But whence do they receive this, except from Him of whom it is here immediately said,
“Giving the vow to him that voweth?” Otherwise they would be of those mighty ones whose
bow is weakened. “Giving,” she saith, “the vow to him that voweth.” For no one could vow
anything acceptable to God, unless he received from Him that which he might vow. There
follows, “And He hath blessed the years of the just,” to wit, that he may live for ever with
Him to whom it is said, “And Thy years shall have no end.” For there the years abide; but
here they pass away, yea, they perish: for before they come they are not, and when they
shall have come they shall not be, because they bring their own end with them. Now of
these two, that is, “giving the vow to him that voweth,” and “He hath blessed the years of
the just,” the one is what we do, the other what we receive. But this other is not received
from God, the liberal giver, until He, the helper, Himself has enabled us for the former; “for
man is not mighty in strength.” “The Lord shall make his adversary weak,” to wit, him who
envies the man that vows, and resists him, lest he should fulfill what he has vowed. Owing
to the ambiguity of the Greek, it may also be understood “his own adversary.” For when
God has begun to possess us, immediately he who had been our adversary becomes His,
and is conquered by us; but not by our own strength, “for man is not mighty in strength.”
Therefore “the Lord shall make His own adversary weak, the Lord is holy,” that he may be
conquered by the saints, whom the Lord, the Holy of holies, hath made saints. For this
reason, “let not the prudent glory in his prudence, and let not the mighty glory in his might,
and let not the rich glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in this,—to understand
and know the Lord, and to do judgment and justice in the midst of the earth.” He in no
small measure understands and knows the Lord who understands and knows that even this,
that he can understand and know the Lord, is given to him by the Lord. “For what hast

thou,” saith the apostle, “that thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost
thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?”1006 That is, as if thou hadst of thine own self
whereof thou mightest glory. Now, he does judgment and justice who lives aright. But he
lives aright who yields obedience to God when He commands. “The end of the commandment,”
that is, to which the commandment has reference, “is charity out of a pure heart,
and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.” Moreover, this “charity,” as the Apostle John
testifies, “is of God.”1007 Therefore to do justice and judgment is of God. But what is “in
the midst of the earth?” For ought those who dwell in the ends of the earth not to do judgment
and justice? Who would say so? Why, then, is it added, “In the midst of the earth?”
For if this had not been added, and it had only been said, “To do judgment and justice,” this
commandment would rather have pertained to both kinds of men,—both those dwelling
inland and those on the sea-coast. But lest any one should think that, after the end of the
life led in this body, there remains a time for doing judgment and justice which he has not
done while he was in the flesh, and that the divine judgment can thus be escaped, “in the
midst of the earth” appears to me to be said of the time when every one lives in the body;
for in this life every one carries about his own earth, which, on a man’s dying, the common
earth takes back, to be surely returned to him on his rising again. Therefore “in the midst
of the earth,” that is, while our soul is shut up in this earthly body, judgment and justice are
to be done, which shall be profitable for us hereafter, when “every one shall receive according
to that he hath done in the body, whether good or bad.”1008 For when the apostle there
says “in the body,” he means in the time he has lived in the body. Yet if any one blaspheme
with malicious mind and impious thought, without any member of his body being employed
in it, he shall not therefore be guiltless because he has not done it with bodily motion, for
he will have done it in that time which he has spent in the body. In the same way we may
suitably understand what we read in the psalm, “But God, our King before the worlds, hath
wrought salvation in the midst of the earth;”1009 so that the Lord Jesus may be understood
to be our God who is before the worlds, because by Him the worlds were made, working
our salvation in the midst of the earth, for the Word was made flesh and dwelt in an earthly
body.</p>

on the day of judgment, “The Lord hath ascended into the heavens, and hath thundered:
He shall judge the ends of the earth, for He is righteous.” Throughout she holds to the order
of the creed of Christians: For the Lord Christ has ascended into heaven, and is to come
thence to judge the quick and dead.1010 For, as saith the apostle, “Who hath ascended but
He who hath also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the
same also that ascended up above all heavens, that He might fill all things.”1011 Therefore
He hath thundered through His clouds, which He hath filled with His Holy Spirit when He
ascended up. Concerning which the bond maid Jerusalem—that is, the unfruitful vineyard—
is threatened in Isaiah the prophet that they shall rain no showers upon her. But “He
shall judge the ends of the earth” is spoken as if it had been said, “even the extremes of the
earth.” For it does not mean that He shall not judge the other parts of the earth, who, without
doubt, shall judge all men. But it is better to understand by the extremes of the earth the
extremes of man, since those things shall not be judged which, in the middle time, are
changed for the better or the worse, but the ending in which he shall be found who is judged.
For which reason it is said, “He that shall persevere even unto the end, the same shall be
saved.”1012 He, therefore, who perseveringly does judgment and justice in the midst of the
earth shall not be condemned when the extremes of the earth shall be judged. “And giveth,”
she saith, “strength to our kings,” that He may not condemn them in judging. He giveth
them strength whereby as kings they rule the flesh, and conquer the world in Him who hath
poured out His blood for them. “And shall exalt the horn of His Christ.” How shall Christ
exalt the horn of His Christ? For He of whom it was said above, “The Lord hath ascended
into the heavens,” meaning the Lord Christ, Himself, as it is said here, “shall exalt the horn
of His Christ.” Who, therefore, is the Christ of His Christ? Does it mean that He shall exalt
the horn of each one of His believing people, as she says in the beginning of this hymn,
“Mine horn is exalted in my God?” For we can rightly call all those christs who are anointed
with His chrism, forasmuch as the whole body with its head is one Christ.1013 These things
hath Hannah, the mother of Samuel, the holy and much-praised man, prophesied, in which,
indeed, the change of the ancient priesthood was then figured and is now fulfilled, since she
that had many children is waxed feeble, that the barren who hath born seven might have
the new priesthood in Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of Those Things Which a Man of God Spake by the Spirit to Eli the
Priest, Signifying that the Priesthood Which Had Been Appointed According to
Aaron Was to Be Taken Away.</head>
<p>But this is said more plainly by a man of God sent to Eli the priest himself, whose name
indeed is not mentioned, but whose office and ministry show him to have been indubitably
a prophet. For it is thus written: “And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said, Thus
saith the Lord, I plainly revealed myself unto thy father’s house, when they were in the land
of Egypt slaves in Pharaoh’s house; and I chose thy father’s house out of all the sceptres of
Israel to fill the office of priest for me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense and wear the
ephod; and I gave thy father’s house for food all the offerings made by fire of the children
of Israel. Wherefore then hast thou looked at mine incense and at mine offerings with an
impudent eye, and hast glorified thy sons above me, to bless the first-fruits of every sacrifice
in Israel before me? Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I said thy house and thy
father’s house should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me;
for them that honor me will I honor, and he that despiseth me shall be despised. Behold,
the days come, that I will cut off thy seed, and the seed of thy father’s house, and thou shalt
never have an old man in my house. And I will cut off the man of thine from mine altar,
so that his eyes shall be consumed, and his heart shall melt away; and every one of thy house
that is left shall fall by the sword of men. And this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come
upon these thy two sons, Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to all that is in mine heart
and in my soul; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ for
ever. And it shall come to pass that he who is left in thine house shall come to worship him
with a piece of money, saying, Put me into one part of thy priesthood, that I may eat
bread.”1014</p>
<p>We cannot say that this prophecy, in which the change of the ancient priesthood is
foretold with so great plainness, was fulfilled in Samuel; for although Samuel was not of
another tribe than that which had been appointed by God to serve at the altar, yet he was
not of the sons of Aaron, whose offspring was set apart that the priests might be taken out
of it. And thus by that transaction also the same change which should come to pass through
Christ Jesus is shadowed forth, and the prophecy itself in deed, not in word, belonged to
the Old Testament properly, but figuratively to the New, signifying by the fact just what was
said by the word to Eli the priest through the prophet. For there were afterwards priests of
Aaron’s race, such as Zadok and Abiathar during David’s reign, and others in succession,
before the time came when those things which were predicted so long before about the
changing of the priesthood behoved to be fulfilled by Christ. But who that now views these
<note type="footnote">1014 1 Sam. ii. 27–36.</note>

<pb n="787"/>
things with a believing eye does not see that they are fulfilled? Since, indeed, no tabernacle,
no temple, no altar, no sacrifice, and therefore no priest either, has remained to the Jews,
to whom it was commanded in the law of God that he should be ordained of the seed of
Aaron; which is also mentioned here by the prophet, when he says, “Thus saith the Lord
God of Israel, I said thy house and thy father’s house shall walk before me for ever: but now
the Lord saith, That be far from me; for them that honor me will I honor, and he that despiseth
me shall be despised.” For that in naming his father’s house he does not mean that
of his immediate father, but that of Aaron, who first was appointed priest, to be succeeded
by others descended from him, is shown by the preceding words, when he says, “I was revealed
unto thy father’s house, when they were in the land of Egypt slaves in Pharaoh’s
house; and I chose thy father’s house out of all the sceptres of Israel to fill the office of priest
for me.” Which of the fathers in that Egyptian slavery, but Aaron, was his father, who, when
they were set free, was chosen to the priesthood? It was of his lineage, therefore, he has said
in this passage it should come to pass that they should no longer be priests; which already
we see fulfilled. If faith be watchful, the things are before us: they are discerned, they are
grasped, and are forced on the eyes of the unwilling, so that they are seen: “Behold the days
come,” he says, “that I will cut off thy seed, and the seed of thy father’s house, and thou shall
never have an old man in mine house. And I will cut off the man of thine from mine altar,
so that his eyes shall be consumed and his heart shall melt away.” Behold the days which
were foretold have already come. There is no priest after the order of Aaron; and whoever
is a man of his lineage, when he sees the sacrifice of the Christians prevailing over the whole
world, but that great honor taken away from himself, his eyes fail and his soul melts away
consumed with grief.</p>
<p>But what follows belongs properly to the house of Eli, to whom these things were said:
“And every one of thine house that is left shall fall by the sword of men. And this shall be
a sign unto thee that shall come upon these thy two sons, Hophni and Phinehas; in one day
they shall die both of them.” This, therefore, is made a sign of the change of the priesthood
from this man’s house, by which it is signified that the priesthood of Aaron’s house is to be
changed. For the death of this man’s sons signified the death not of the men, but of the
priesthood itself of the sons of Aaron. But what follows pertains to that Priest whom Samuel
typified by succeeding this one. Therefore the things which follow are said of Christ Jesus,
the true Priest of the New Testament: “And I will raise me up a faithful Priest that shall do
according to all that is in mine heart and in my soul; and I will build Him a sure house.”
The same is the eternal Jerusalem above. “And He shall walk,” saith He, “before my Christ
always.” “He shall walk” means “he shall be conversant with,” just as He had said before of
Aaron’s house, “I said that thine house and thy father’s house shall walk before me for ever.”
But what He says, “He shall walk before my Christ,” is to be understood entirely of the house
itself, not of the priest, who is Christ Himself, the Mediator and Saviour. His house, therefore,

<pb n="788"/>
shall walk before Him. “Shall walk” may also be understood to mean from death to life, all
the time this mortality passes through, even to the end of this world. But where God says,
“Who will do all that is in mine heart and in my soul,” we must not think that God has a
soul, for He is the Author of souls; but this is said of God tropically, not properly, just as
He is said to have hands and feet, and other corporal members. And, lest it should be supposed
from such language that man in the form of this flesh is made in the image of God,
wings also are ascribed to Him, which man has not at all; and it is said to God, “Hide me
under the shadow of Thy wings,”1015 that men may understand that such things are said of
that ineffable nature not in proper but in figurative words.</p>
<p>But what is added, “And it shall come to pass that he who is left in thine house shall
come to worship him,” is not said properly of the house of this Eli, but of that Aaron, the
men of which remained even to the advent of Jesus Christ, of which race there are not
wanting men even to this present. For of that house of Eli it had already been said above,
“And every one of thine house that is left shall fall by the sword of men.” How, therefore,
could it be truly said here, “And it shall come to pass that every one that is left shall come
to worship him,” if that is true, that no one shall escape the avenging sword, unless he would
have it understood of those who belong to the race of that whole priesthood after the order
of Aaron? Therefore, if it is of these the predestinated remnant, about whom another
prophet has said, “The remnant shall be saved;”1016 whence the apostle also says, “Even so
then at this time also the remnant according to the election of grace is saved;”1017 since it
is easily understood to be of such a remnant that it is said, “He that is left in thine house,”
assuredly he believes in Christ; just as in the time of the apostle very many of that nation
believed; nor are there now wanting those, although very few, who yet believe, and in them
is fulfilled what this man of God has here immediately added, “He shall come to worship
him with a piece of money;” to worship whom, if not that Chief Priest, who is also God?
For in that priesthood after the order of Aaron men did not come to the temple or altar of
God for the purpose of worshipping the priest. But what is that he says, “With a piece of
money,” if not the short word of faith, about which the apostle quotes the saying, “A consummating

<p>What then does he say who comes to worship the priest of God, even the Priest who is
God? “Put me into one part of Thy priesthood, to eat bread.” I do not wish to be set in the
honor of my fathers, which is none; put me in a part of Thy priesthood. For “I have chosen
to be mean in Thine house;”1020 I desire to be a member, no matter what, or how small, of
Thy priesthood. By the priesthood he here means the people itself, of which He is the Priest
who is the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.1021 This people the
Apostle Peter calls “a holy people, a royal priesthood.”1022 But some have translated, “Of
Thy sacrifice,” not “Of Thy priesthood,” which no less signifies the same Christian people.
Whence the Apostle Paul says, “We being many are one bread, one body.”1023 [And again
he says, “Present your bodies a living sacrifice.”1024] What, therefore, he has added, to “eat
bread,” also elegantly expresses the very kind of sacrifice of which the Priest Himself says,
“The bread which I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.”1025 The same is the sacrifice
not after the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedec:1026 let him that readeth
understand.1027 Therefore this short and salutarily humble confession, in which it is said,
“Put me in a part of Thy priesthood, to eat bread,” is itself the piece of money, for it is both
brief, and it is the Word of God who dwells in the heart of one who believes. For because
He had said above, that He had given for food to Aaron’s house the sacrificial victims of the
Old Testament, where He says, “I have given thy father’s house for food all things which
are offered by fire of the children of Israel,” which indeed were the sacrifices of the Jews;
therefore here He has said, “To eat bread,” which is in the New Testament the sacrifice of
the Christians.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Of the Jewish Priesthood and Kingdom, Which, Although Promised
to Be Established for Ever, Did Not Continue; So that Other Things are to Be
Understood to Which Eternity is Assured.</head>
<p>While, therefore, these things now shine forth as clearly as they were loftily foretold,
still some one may not vainly be moved to ask, How can we be confident that all things are
to come to pass which are predicted in these books as about to come, if this very thing which
is there divinely spoken, “Thine house and thy father’s house shall walk before me for ever,”
could not have effect? For we see that priesthood has been changed; and there can be no
hope that what was promised to that house may some time be fulfilled, because that which
succeeds on its being rejected and changed is rather predicted as eternal. He who says this
does not yet understand, or does not recollect, that this very priesthood after the order of
Aaron was appointed as the shadow of a future eternal priesthood; and therefore, when
eternity is promised to it, it is not promised to the mere shadow and figure, but to what is
shadowed forth and prefigured by it. But lest it should be thought the shadow itself was to
remain, therefore its mutation also behoved to be foretold.</p>
<p>In this way, too, the kingdom of Saul himself, who certainly was reprobated and rejected,
was the shadow of a kingdom yet to come which should remain to eternity. For, indeed,
the oil with which he was anointed, and from that chrism he is called Christ, is to be taken
in a mystical sense, and is to be understood as a great mystery; which David himself venerated
so much in him, that he trembled with smitten heart when, being hid in a dark cave, which
Saul also entered when pressed by the necessity of nature, he had come secretly behind him
and cut off a small piece of his robe, that he might be able to prove how he had spared him
when he could have killed him, and might thus remove from his mind the suspicion through
which he had vehemently persecuted the holy David, thinking him his enemy. Therefore
he was much afraid lest he should be accused of violating so great a mystery in Saul, because
he had thus meddled even his clothes. For thus it is written: “And David’s heart smote him
because he had taken away the skirt of his cloak.”1028 But to the men with him, who advised
him to destroy Saul thus delivered up into his hands, he saith, “The Lord forbid that I should
do this thing to my lord, the Lord’s christ, to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord’s
christ.” Therefore he showed so great reverence to this shadow of what was to come, not
for its own sake, but for the sake of what it prefigured. Whence also that which Samuel says
to Saul, “Since thou hast not kept my commandment which the Lord commanded thee,
whereas now the Lord would have prepared thy kingdom over Israel for ever, yet now thy
kingdom shall not continue for thee; and the Lord will seek Him a man after His own heart,
and the Lord will command him to be prince over His people, because thou hast not kept
<note type="footnote">1028 1 Sam. xxiv. 5, 6.</note>

<pb n="791"/>
that which the Lord commanded thee,”1029 is not to be taken as if God had settled that Saul
himself should reign for ever, and afterwards, on his sinning, would not keep this promise;
nor was He ignorant that he would sin, but He had established his kingdom that it might
be a figure of the eternal kingdom. Therefore he added, “Yet now thy kingdom shall not
continue for thee.” Therefore what it signified has stood and shall stand; but it shall not
stand for this man, because he himself was not to reign for ever, nor his offspring; so that
at least that word “for ever” might seem to be fulfilled through his posterity one to another.
“And the Lord,” he saith, “will seek Him a man,” meaning either David or the Mediator of
the New Testament,1030 who was figured in the chrism with which David also and his offspring
was anointed. But it is not as if He knew not where he was that God thus seeks Him
a man, but, speaking through a man, He speaks as a man, and in this sense seeks us. For
not only to God the Father, but also to His Only-begotten, who came to seek what was
lost,1031 we had been known already even so far as to be chosen in Him before the foundation
of the world.1032 “He will seek Him” therefore means, He will have His own (just as if He
had said, Whom He already has known to be His own He will show to others to be His
friend). Whence in Latin this word (quærit) receives a preposition and becomes acquirit
(acquires), the meaning of which is plain enough; although even without the addition of
the preposition quærere is understood as acquirere, whence gains are called quæstus.</p>

<p>Again Saul sinned through disobedience, and again Samuel says to him in the word of
the Lord, “Because thou hast despised the word of the Lord, the Lord hath despised thee,
that thou mayest not be king over Israel.”1033 And again for the same sin, when Saul confessed
it, and prayed for pardon, and besought Samuel to return with him to appease the
Lord, he said, “I will not return with thee: for thou hast despised the word of the Lord, and
the Lord will despise thee that thou mayest not be king over Israel. And Samuel turned his
face to go away, and Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and rent it. And Samuel
said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom from Israel out of thine hand this day, and
will give it to thy neighbor, who is good above thee, and will divide Israel in twain. And He
will not be changed, neither will He repent: for He is not as a man, that He should repent;
who threatens and does not persist.”1034 He to whom it is said, “The Lord will despise thee
that thou mayest not be king over Israel,” and “The Lord hath rent the kingdom from Israel
out of thine hand this day,” reigned forty years over Israel,—that is, just as long a time as
David himself,—yet heard this in the first period of his reign, that we may understand it
was said because none of his race was to reign, and that we may look to the race of David,
whence also is sprung, according to the flesh,1035 the Mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus.1036</p>
<p>But the Scripture has not what is read in most Latin copies, “The Lord hath rent the
kingdom of Israel out of thine hand this day,” but just as we have set it down it is found in
the Greek copies, “The Lord hath rent the kingdom from Israel out of thine hand;” that the
words “out of thine hand” may be understood to mean “from Israel.” Therefore this man
figuratively represented the people of Israel, which was to lose the kingdom, Christ Jesus
our Lord being about to reign, not carnally, but spiritually. And when it is said of Him,
“And will give it to thy neighbor,” that is to be referred to the fleshly kinship, for Christ,
according to the flesh, was of Israel, whence also Saul sprang. But what is added, “Good
above thee,” may indeed be understood, “Better than thee,” and indeed some have thus
translated it; but it is better taken thus, “Good above thee,” as meaning that because He is
good, therefore He must be above thee, according to that other prophetic saying, “Till I put
all Thine enemies under Thy feet.”1037 And among them is Israel, from whom, as His persecutor,
Christ took away the kingdom; although the Israel in whom there was no guile may

have been there too, a sort of grain, as it were, of that chaff. For certainly thence came the
apostles, thence so many martyrs, of whom Stephen is the first, thence so many churches,
which the Apostle Paul names, magnifying God in their conversion.</p>
<p>Of which thing I do not doubt what follows is to be understood, “And will divide Israel
in twain,” to wit, into Israel pertaining to the bond woman, and Israel pertaining to the free.
For these two kinds were at first together, as Abraham still clave to the bond woman, until
the barren, made fruitful by the grace of God, cried, “Cast out the bond woman and her
son.”1038 We know, indeed, that on account of the sin of Solomon, in the reign of his son
Rehoboam, Israel was divided in two, and continued so, the separate parts having their own
kings, until that whole nation was overthrown with a great destruction, and carried away
by the Chaldeans. But what was this to Saul, when, if any such thing was threatened, it
would be threatened against David himself, whose son Solomon was? Finally, the Hebrew
nation is not now divided internally, but is dispersed through the earth indiscriminately, in
the fellowship of the same error. But that division with which God threatened the kingdom
and people in the person of Saul, who represented them, is shown to be eternal and unchangeable
by this which is added, “And He will not be changed, neither will He repent: for He is
not as a man, that He should repent; who threatens and does not persist,”—that is, a man
threatens and does not persist, but not God, who does not repent like man. For when we
read that He repents, a change of circumstance is meant, flowing from the divine immutable
foreknowledge. Therefore, when God is said not to repent, it is to be understood that He
does not change.</p>
<p>We see that this sentence concerning this division of the people of Israel, divinely uttered
in these words, has been altogether irremediable and quite perpetual. For whoever have
turned, or are turning, or shall turn thence to Christ, it has been according to the foreknowledge
of God, not according to the one and the same nature of the human race. Certainly
none of the Israelites, who, cleaving to Christ, have continued in Him, shall ever be among
those Israelites who persist in being His enemies even to the end of this life, but shall for
ever remain in the separation which is here foretold. For the Old Testament, from the
Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,1039 profiteth nothing, unless because it bears
witness to the New Testament. Otherwise, however long Moses is read, the veil is put over
their heart; but when any one shall turn thence to Christ, the veil shall be taken away.1040
For the very desire of those who turn is changed from the old to the new, so that each no
longer desires to obtain carnal but spiritual felicity. Wherefore that great prophet Samuel
himself, before he had anointed Saul, when he had cried to the Lord for Israel, and He had

heard him, and when he had offered a whole burnt-offering, as the aliens were coming to
battle against the people of God, and the Lord thundered above them and they were confused,
and fell before Israel and were overcome; [then] he took one stone and set it up between
the old and new Massephat [Mizpeh], and called its name Ebenezer, which means “the stone
of the helper,” and said, “Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.”1041 Massephat is interpreted
“desire.” That stone of the helper is the mediation of the Saviour, by which we go from the
old Massephat to the new,—that is, from the desire with which carnal happiness was expected
in the carnal kingdom to the desire with which the truest spiritual happiness is expected in
the kingdom of heaven; and since nothing is better than that, the Lord helpeth us hitherto.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Of the Promises Made to David in His Son, Which are in No Wise
Fulfilled in Solomon, But Most Fully in Christ.</head>
<p>And now I see I must show what, pertaining to the matter I treat of, God promised to
David himself, who succeeded Saul in the kingdom, whose change prefigured that final
change on account of which all things were divinely spoken, all things were committed to
writing. When many things had gone prosperously with king David, he thought to make
a house for God, even that temple of most excellent renown which was afterwards built by
king Solomon his son. While he was thinking of this, the word of the Lord came to Nathan
the prophet, which he brought to the king, in which, after God had said that a house should
not be built unto Him by David himself, and that in all that long time He had never commanded
any of His people to build Him a house of cedar, he says, “And now thus shalt thou
say unto my servant David, Thus saith God Almighty, I took thee from the sheep-cote that
thou mightest be for a ruler over my people in Israel: and I was with thee whithersoever
thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thy face, and have made thee
a name, according to the name of the great ones who are over the earth. And I will appoint
a place for my people Israel, and will plant him, and he shall dwell apart, and shall be troubled
no more; and the son of wickedness shall not humble him any more, as from the beginning,
from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give thee rest from
all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell [hath told] thee, because thou shall build an house
for Him. And it shall come to pass when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shall sleep with thy
fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I
will prepare his kingdom. He shall build me an house for my name; and I will order his
throne even to eternity. I will be his Father, and he shall be my son. And if he commit
iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men:
but my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from those whom I put away
from before my face. And his house shall be faithful, and his kingdom even for evermore
before me, and his throne shall be set up even for evermore.”1042</p>
<p>He who thinks this grand promise was fulfilled in Solomon greatly errs; for he attends
to the saying, “He shall build me an house,” but he does not attend to the saying, “His house
shall be faithful, and his kingdom for evermore before me.” Let him therefore attend and
behold the house of Solomon full of strange women worshipping false gods, and the king
himself, aforetime wise, seduced by them, and cast down into the same idolatry: and let
him not dare to think that God either promised this falsely, or was unable to foreknow that
Solomon and his house would become what they did. But we ought not to be in doubt here,
or to see the fulfillment of these things save in Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed
<note type="footnote">1042 2 Sam. vii. 8–16.</note>

<pb n="796"/>
of David according to the flesh,1043 lest we should vainly and uselessly look for some other
here, like the carnal Jews. For even they understand this much, that the son whom they
read of in that place as promised to David was not Solomon; so that, with wonderful blindness
to Him who was promised and is now declared with so great manifestation, they say they
hope for another. Indeed, even in Solomon there appeared some image of the future event,
in that he built the temple, and had peace according to his name (for Solomon means “pacific”),
and in the beginning of his reign was wonderfully praiseworthy; but while, as a
shadow of Him that should come, he foreshowed Christ our Lord, he did not also in his
own person resemble Him. Whence some things concerning him are so written as if they
were prophesied of himself, while the Holy Scripture, prophesying even by events, somehow
delineates in him the figure of things to come. For, besides the books of divine history, in
which his reign is narrated, the 72d Psalm also is inscribed in the title with his name, in
which so many things are said which cannot at all apply to him, but which apply to the Lord
Christ with such evident fitness as makes it quite apparent that in the one the figure is in
some way shadowed forth, but in the other the truth itself is presented. For it is known
within what bounds the kingdom of Solomon was enclosed; and yet in that psalm, not to
speak of other things, we read, “He shall have dominion from sea even to sea, and from the
river to the ends of the earth,”1044 which we see fulfilled in Christ. Truly he took the beginning
of His reigning from the river where John baptized; for, when pointed out by him, He
began to be acknowledged by the disciples, who called Him not only Master, but also Lord.</p>
<p>Nor was it for any other reason that, while his father David was still living, Solomon
began to reign, which happened to none other of their kings, except that from this also it
might be clearly apparent that it was not himself this prophecy spoken to his father signified
beforehand, saying, “And it shall come to pass when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shall
sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed which shall proceed out of thy bowels,
and I will prepare His kingdom.” How, therefore, shall it be thought on account of what
follows, “He shall build me an house,” that this Solomon is prophesied, and not rather be
understood on account of what precedes, “When thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep
with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee,” that another pacific One is promised,
who is foretold as about to be raised up, not before David’s death, as he was, but after it?
For however long the interval of time might be before Jesus Christ came, beyond doubt it
was after the death of king David, to whom He was so promised, that He behoved to come,
who should build an house of God, not of wood and stone, but of men, such as we rejoice
He does build. For to this house, that is, to believers, the apostle saith, “The temple of God
is holy, which temple ye are.”1045</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—How Like the Prophecy About Christ in the 89th Psalm is to the Things
Promised in Nathan’s Prophecy in the Books of Samuel.</head>
<p>Wherefore also in the 89th Psalm, of which the title is, “An instruction for himself by
Ethan the Israelite,” mention is made of the promises God made to king David, and some
things are there added similar to those found in the Book of Samuel, such as this, “I have
sworn to David my servant that I will prepare his seed for ever.”1046 And again, “Then thou
spakest in vision to thy sons, and saidst, I have laid help upon the mighty One, and have
exalted the chosen One out of my people. I have found David my servant, and with my holy
oil I have anointed him. For mine hand shall help him, and mine arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not prevail against him, and the son of iniquity shall harm him no more.
And I will beat down his foes from before his face, and those that hate him will I put to
flight. And my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be
exalted. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. He shall cry unto
me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the undertaker of my salvation. Also I will make him
my first-born, high among the kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
and my covenant shall be faithful (sure) with him. His seed also will I set for ever and ever,
and his throne as the days of heaven.”1047 Which words, when rightly understood, are all
understood to be about the Lord Jesus Christ, under the name of David, on account of the
form of a servant, which the same Mediator assumed1048 from the virgin of the seed of
David.1049 For immediately something is said about the sins of his children, such as is set
down in the Book of Samuel, and is more readily taken as if of Solomon. For there, that is,
in the Book of Samuel, he says, “And if he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod
of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men; but my mercy will I not take away from
him,”1050 meaning by stripes the strokes of correction. Hence that saying, “Touch ye not
my christs.”1051 For what else is that than, Do not harm them? But in the psalm, when
speaking as if of David, He says something of the same kind there too. “If his children,”
saith He, “forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they profane my righteousnesses,
and keep not my commandments; I will visit their iniquities with the rod, and their faults
with stripes: but my mercy I will not make void from him.”1052 He did not say “from them,”

although He spoke of his children, not of himself; but he said “from him,” which means the
same thing if rightly understood. For of Christ Himself, who is the head of the Church,
there could not be found any sins which required to be divinely restrained by human correction,
mercy being still continued; but they are found in His body and members, which
is His people. Therefore in the Book of Samuel it is said, “iniquity of Him,” but in the psalm,
“of His children,” that we may understand that what is said of His body is in some way said
of Himself. Wherefore also, when Saul persecuted His body, that is, His believing people,
He Himself saith from heaven, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”1053 Then in the following
words of the psalm He says, “Neither will I hurt in my truth, nor profane my covenant,
and the things that proceed from my lips I will not disallow. Once have I sworn by my
holiness, if I lie unto David,”1054—that is, I will in no wise lie unto David; for Scripture is
wont to speak thus. But what that is in which He will not lie, He adds, saying, “His seed
shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me, and as the moon perfected for
ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.”1055</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—How Different the Acts in the Kingdom of the Earthly Jerusalem are
from Those Which God Had Promised, So that the Truth of the Promise Should
Be Understood to Pertain to the Glory of the Other King and Kingdom.</head>
<p>That it might not be supposed that a promise so strongly expressed and confirmed was
fulfilled in Solomon, as if he hoped for, yet did not find it, he says, “But Thou hast cast off,
and hast brought to nothing, O Lord.”1056 This truly was done concerning the kingdom of
Solomon among his posterity, even to the overthrow of the earthly Jerusalem itself, which
was the seat of the kingdom, and especially the destruction of the very temple which had
been built by Solomon. But lest on this account God should be thought to have done contrary
to His promise, immediately he adds, “Thou hast delayed Thy Christ.”1057 Therefore he is
not Solomon, nor yet David himself, if the Christ of the Lord is delayed. For while all the
kings are called His christs, who were consecrated with that mystical chrism, not only from
king David downwards, but even from that Saul who first was anointed king of that same
people, David himself indeed calling him the Lord’s christ, yet there was one true Christ,
whose figure they bore by the prophetic unction, who, according to the opinion of men,
who thought he was to be understood as come in David or in Solomon, was long delayed,
but who, according as God had disposed, was to come in His own time. The following part
of this psalm goes on to say what in the meantime, while He was delayed, was to become of
the kingdom of the earthly Jerusalem, where it was hoped He would certainly reign: “Thou
hast overthrown the covenant of Thy servant; Thou hast profaned in the earth his sanctuary.
Thou hast broken down all his walls; Thou hast put his strong-holds in fear. All that pass
by the way spoil him; he is made a reproach to his neighbors. Thou hast set up the right
hand of his enemies; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. Thou hast turned aside the
help of his sword, and hast not helped him in war. Thou hast destroyed him from cleansing;
Thou hast dashed down his seat to the ground. Thou hast shortened the days of his seat;
Thou hast poured confusion over him.”1058 All these things came upon Jerusalem the bond
woman, in which some also reigned who were children of the free woman, holding that
kingdom in temporary stewardship, but holding the kingdom of the heavenly Jerusalem,
whose children they were, in true faith, and hoping in the true Christ. But how these things
came upon that kingdom, the history of its affairs points out if it is read.</p>

yet even the very prayer is prophecy: “How long, Lord, dost Thou turn away in the end?”1059
“Thy face” is understood, as it is elsewhere said, “How long dost Thou turn away Thy face
from me?”1060 For therefore some copies have here not “dost,” but “wilt Thou turn away;”
although it could be understood, “Thou turnest away Thy mercy, which Thou didst promise
to David.” But when he says, “in the end,” what does it mean, except even to the end? By
which end is to be understood the last time, when even that nation is to believe in Christ
Jesus, before which end what He has just sorrowfully bewailed must come to pass. On account
of which it is also added here, “Thy wrath shall burn like fire. Remember what is my
substance.”1061 This cannot be better understood than of Jesus Himself, the substance of
His people, of whose nature His flesh is. “For not in vain,” he says, “hast Thou made all the
sons of men.”1062 For unless the one Son of man had been the substance of Israel, through
which Son of man many sons of men should be set free, all the sons of men would have been
made wholly in vain. But now, indeed, all mankind through the fall of the first man has
fallen from the truth into vanity; for which reason another psalm says, “Man is like to vanity:
his days pass away as a shadow;”1063 yet God has not made all the sons of men in vain, because
He frees many from vanity through the Mediator Jesus, and those whom He did not
foreknow as to be delivered, He made not wholly in vain in the most beautiful and most
just ordination of the whole rational creation, for the use of those who were to be delivered,
and for the comparison of the two cities by mutual contrast. Thereafter it follows, “Who is
the man that shall live, and shall not see death? shall he snatch his soul from the hand of
hell?”1064 Who is this but that substance of Israel out of the seed of David, Christ Jesus, of
whom the apostle says, that “rising from the dead He now dieth not, and death shall no
more have dominion over Him?”1065 For He shall so live and not see death, that yet He
shall have been dead; but shall have delivered His soul from the hand of hell, whither He
had descended in order to loose some from the chains of hell; but He hath delivered it by

<head>Chapter 12.—To Whose Person the Entreaty for the Promises is to Be Understood
to Belong, When He Says in the Psalm, “Where are Thine Ancient Compassions,
Lord?” Etc.</head>
<p>But the rest of this psalm runs thus: “Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord,
which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,
which I have borne in my bosom of many nations; wherewith Thine enemies have reproached,
O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of Thy Christ.”1067 Now it
may with very good reason be asked whether this is spoken in the person of those Israelites
who desired that the promise made to David might be fulfilled to them; or rather of the
Christians, who are Israelites not after the flesh but after the Spirit.1068 This certainly was
spoken or written in the time of Ethan, from whose name this psalm gets its title, and that
was the same as the time of David’s reign; and therefore it would not have been said, “Where
are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou hast sworn unto David in Thy truth?”
unless the prophet had assumed the person of those who should come long afterwards, to
whom that time when these things were promised to David was ancient. But it may be understood
thus, that many nations, when they persecuted the Christians, reproached them
with the passion of Christ, which Scripture calls His change, because by dying He is made
immortal. The change of Christ, according to this passage, may also be understood to be
reproached by the Israelites, because, when they hoped He would be theirs, He was made
the Saviour of the nations; and many nations who have believed in Him by the New Testament
now reproach them who remain in the old with this: so that it is said, “Remember,
Lord, the reproach of Thy servants;” because through the Lord’s not forgetting, but rather
pitying them, even they after this reproach are to believe. But what I have put first seems
to me the most suitable meaning. For to the enemies of Christ who are reproached with
this, that Christ hath left them, turning to the Gentiles,1069 this speech is incongruously
assigned, “Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,” for such Jews are not to be styled
the servants of God; but these words fit those who, if they suffered great humiliations through
persecution for the name of Christ, could call to mind that an exalted kingdom had been
promised to the seed of David, and in desire of it, could say not despairingly, but as asking,
seeking, knocking,1070 “Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest
unto David in Thy truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, that I have borne
in my bosom of many nations;” that is, have patiently endured in my inward parts. “That

<note type="footnote">1070 Matt. vii. 7, 8.</note>

<pb n="803"/>
Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of
Thy Christ,” not thinking it a change, but a consumption.1071 But what does “Remember,
Lord,” mean, but that Thou wouldst have compassion, and wouldst for my patiently borne
humiliation reward me with the excellency which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth?
But if we assign these words to the Jews, those servants of God who, on the conquest of the
earthly Jerusalem, before Jesus Christ was born after the manner of men, were led into
captivity, could say such things, understanding the change of Christ, because indeed through
Him was to be surely expected, not an earthly and carnal felicity, such as appeared during
the few years of king Solomon, but a heavenly and spiritual felicity; and when the nations,
then ignorant of this through unbelief, exulted over and insulted the people of God for being
captives, what else was this than ignorantly to reproach with the change of Christ those who
understand the change of Christ? And therefore what follows when this psalm is concluded,
“Let the blessing of the Lord be for evermore, amen, amen,” is suitable enough for the whole
people of God belonging to the heavenly Jerusalem, whether for those things that lay hid in
the Old Testament before the New was revealed, or for those that, being now revealed in
the New Testament, are manifestly discerned to belong to Christ. For the blessing of the
Lord in the seed of David does not belong to any particular time, such as appeared in the
days of Solomon, but is for evermore to be hoped for, in which most certain hope it is said,
“Amen, amen;” for this repetition of the word is the confirmation of that hope. Therefore
David understanding this, says in the second Book of Kings, in the passage from which we
digressed to this psalm,1072 “Thou hast spoken also for Thy servant’s house for a great while
to come.”1073 Therefore also a little after he says, “Now begin, and bless the house of Thy
servant for evermore,” etc., because the son was then about to be born from whom his posterity
should be continued to Christ, through whom his house should be eternal, and should
also be the house of God. For it is called the house of David on account of David’s race; but
the selfsame is called the house of God on account of the temple of God, made of men, not
of stones, where shall dwell for evermore the people with and in their God, and God with
and in His people, so that God may fill His people, and the people be filled with their God,
while God shall be all in all, Himself their reward in peace who is their strength in war.
Therefore, when it is said in the words of Nathan, “And the Lord will tell thee what an house
thou shalt build for Him,”1074 it is afterwards said in the words of David, “For Thou, Lord
Almighty, God of Israel, hast opened the ear of Thy servant, saying, I will build thee an
house.”1075 For this house is built both by us through living well, and by God through

helping us to live well; for “except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build
it.”1076 And when the final dedication of this house shall take place, then what God here
says by Nathan shall be fulfilled, “And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
plant him, and he shall dwell apart, and shall be troubled no more; and the son of iniquity
shall not humble him any more, as from the beginning, from the days when I appointed
judges over my people Israel.”1077</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Whether the Truth of This Promised Peace Can Be Ascribed to Those
Times Passed Away Under Solomon.</head>
<p>Whoever hopes for this so great good in this world, and in this earth, his wisdom is but
folly. Can any one think it was fulfilled in the peace of Solomon’s reign? Scripture certainly
commends that peace with excellent praise as a shadow of that which is to come. But this
opinion is to be vigilantly opposed, since after it is said, “And the son of iniquity shall not
humble him any more,” it is immediately added, “as from the beginning, from the days in
which I appointed judges over my people Israel.”1078 For the judges were appointed over
that people from the time when they received the land of promise, before kings had begun
to be there. And certainly the son of iniquity, that is, the foreign enemy, humbled him
through periods of time in which we read that peace alternated with wars; and in that period
longer times of peace are found than Solomon had, who reigned forty years. For under that
judge who is called Ehud there were eighty years of peace.1079 Be it far from us, therefore,
that we should believe the times of Solomon are predicted in this promise, much less indeed
those of any other king whatever. For none other of them reigned in such great peace as
he; nor did that nation ever at all hold that kingdom so as to have no anxiety lest it should
be subdued by enemies: for in the very great mutability of human affairs such great security
is never given to any people, that it should not dread invasions hostile to this life. Therefore
the place of this promised peaceful and secure habitation is eternal, and of right belongs
eternally to Jerusalem the free mother, where the genuine people of Israel shall be: for this
name is interpreted “Seeing God;” in the desire of which reward a pious life is to be led
through faith in this miserable pilgrimage.1080</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of David’s Concern in the Writing of the Psalms.</head>
<p>In the progress of the city of God through the ages, therefore, David first reigned in the
earthly Jerusalem as a shadow of that which was to come. Now David was a man skilled in
songs, who dearly loved musical harmony, not with a vulgar delight, but with a believing
disposition, and by it served his God, who is the true God, by the mystical representation
of a great thing. For the rational and well-ordered concord of diverse sounds in harmonious
variety suggests the compact unity of the well-ordered city. Then almost all his prophecy
is in psalms, of which a hundred and fifty are contained in what we call the Book of Psalms,
of which some will have it those only were made by David which are in scribed with his
name. But there are also some who think none of them were made by him except those
which are marked “Of David;” but those which have in the title “For David” have been made
by others who assumed his person. Which opinion is refuted by the voice of the Saviour
Himself in the Gospel, when He says that David himself by the Spirit said Christ was his
Lord; for the 110th Psalm begins thus, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right
hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”1081 And truly that very psalm, like many
more, has in the title, not “of David,” but “for David.” But those seem to me to hold the
more credible opinion, who ascribe to him the authorship of all these hundred and fifty
psalms, and think that he prefixed to some of them the names even of other men, who prefigured
something pertinent to the matter, but chose to have no man’s name in the titles of
the rest, just as God inspired him in the management of this variety, which, although dark,
is not meaningless. Neither ought it to move one not to believe this that the names of some
prophets who lived long after the times of king David are read in the inscriptions of certain
psalms in that book, and that the things said there seem to be spoken as it were by them.
Nor was the prophetic Spirit unable to reveal to king David, when he prophesied, even these
names of future prophets, so that he might prophetically sing something which should suit
their persons; just as it was revealed to a certain prophet that king Josiah should arise and
reign after more than three hundred years, who predicted his future deeds also along with
his name.1082</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Whether All the Things Prophesied in the Psalms Concerning Christ
and His Church Should Be Taken Up in the Text of This Work.</head>
<p>And now I see it may be expected of me that I shall open up in this part of this book
what David may have prophesied in the Psalms concerning the Lord Jesus Christ or His
Church. But although I have already done so in one instance, I am prevented from doing
as that expectation seems to demand, rather by the abundance than the scarcity of matter.
For the necessity of shunning prolixity forbids my setting down all things; yet I fear lest if
I select some I shall appear to many, who know these things, to have passed by the more
necessary. Besides, the proof that is adduced ought to be supported by the context of the
whole psalm, so that at least there may be nothing against it if everything does not support
it; lest we should seem, after the fashion of the centos, to gather for the thing we wish, as it
were, verses out of a grand poem, what shall be found to have been written not about it, but
about some other and widely different thing. But ere this could be pointed out in each
psalm, the whole of it must be expounded; and how great a work that would be, the volumes
of others, as well as our own, in which we have done it, show well enough. Let him then
who will, or can, read these volumes, and he will find out how many and great things David,
at once king and prophet, has prophesied concerning Christ and His Church, to wit, concerning
the King and the city which He has built.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Of the Things Pertaining to Christ and the Church, Said Either Openly
or Tropically in the 45th Psalm.</head>
<p>For whatever direct and manifest prophetic utterances there may be about anything, it
is necessary that those which are tropical should be mingled with them; which, chiefly on
account of those of slower understanding, thrust upon the more learned the laborious task
of clearing up and expounding them. Some of them, indeed, on the very first blush, as soon
as they are spoken, exhibit Christ and the Church, although some things in them that are
less intelligible remain to be expounded at leisure. We have an example of this in that same
Book of Psalms: “My heart bubbled up a good matter: I utter my words to the king. My
tongue is the pen of a scribe, writing swiftly. Thy form is beautiful beyond the sons of men;
grace is poured out in Thy lips: therefore God hath blessed Thee for evermore. Gird Thy
sword about Thy thigh, O Most Mighty. With Thy goodliness and Thy beauty go forward,
proceed prosperously, and reign, because of Thy truth, and meekness, and righteousness;
and Thy right hand shall lead Thee forth wonderfully. Thy sharp arrows are most powerful:
in the heart of the king’s enemies. The people shall fall under Thee. Thy throne, O God, is
for ever and ever: a rod of direction is the rod of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness,
and hast hated iniquity: therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of
exultation above Thy fellows. Myrrh and drops, and cassia from Thy vestments, from the
houses of ivory: out of which the daughters of kings have delighted Thee in Thine hon-
or.”1083 Who is there, no matter how slow, but must here recognize Christ whom we
preach, and in whom we believe, if he hears that He is God, whose throne is for ever and
ever, and that He is anointed by God, as God indeed anoints, not with a visible, but with a
spiritual and intelligible chrism? For who is so untaught in this religion, or so deaf to its
far and wide spread fame, as not to know that Christ is named from this chrism, that is,
from this anointing? But when it is acknowledged that this King is Christ, let each one who
is already subject to Him who reigns because of truth, meekness, and righteousness, inquire
at his leisure into these other things that are here said tropically: how His form is beautiful
beyond the sons of men, with a certain beauty that is the more to be loved and admired the
less it is corporeal; and what His sword, arrows, and other things of that kind may be, which
are set down, not properly, but tropically.</p>
<p>Then let him look upon His Church, joined to her so great Husband in spiritual marriage
and divine love, of which it is said in these words which follow, “The queen stood upon Thy
right hand in gold-embroidered vestments, girded about with variety. Hearken, O daughter,
and look, and incline thine ear; forget also thy people, and thy father’s house. Because the
King hath greatly desired thy beauty; for He is the Lord thy God. And the daughters of Tyre
shall worship Him with gifts; the rich among the people shall entreat Thy face. The
<note type="footnote">1083 Ps. xlv. 1–9.</note>

<pb n="809"/>
daughter of the King has all her glory within, in golden fringes, girded about with variety.
The virgins shall be brought after her to the King: her neighbors shall be brought to Thee.
They shall be brought with gladness and exultation: they shall be led into the temple of the
King. Instead of thy fathers, sons shall be born to thee: thou shalt establish them as princes
over all the earth. They shall be mindful of thy name in every generation and descent.
Therefore shall the people acknowledge thee for evermore, even for ever and ever.”1084 I
do not think any one is so stupid as to believe that some poor woman is here praised and
described, as the spouse, to wit, of Him to whom it is said, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever
and ever: a rod of direction is the rod of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness and
hated iniquity: therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of exultation above
Thy fellows;”1085 that is, plainly, Christ above Christians. For these are His fellows, out of
the unity and concord of whom in all nations that queen is formed, as it is said of her in
another psalm, “The city of the great King.”1086 The same is Sion spiritually, which name
in Latin is interpreted speculatio (discovery); for she descries the great good of the world
to come, because her attention is directed thither. In the same way she is also Jerusalem
spiritually, of which we have already said many things. Her enemy is the city of the devil,
Babylon, which is interpreted “confusion.” Yet out of this Babylon this queen is in all nations
set free by regeneration, and passes from the worst to the best King,—that is, from the devil
to Christ. Wherefore it is said to her, “Forget thy people and thy father’s house.” Of this
impious city those also are a portion who are Israelites only in the flesh and not by faith,
enemies also of this great King Himself, and of His queen. For Christ, having come to them,
and been slain by them, has the more become the King of others, whom He did not see in
the flesh. Whence our King Himself says through the prophecy of a certain psalm, “Thou
wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people; Thou wilt make me head of the nations.
A people whom I have not known hath served me: in the hearing of the ear it hath obeyed
me.”1087 Therefore this people of the nations, which Christ did not know in His bodily
presence, yet has believed in that Christ as announced to it; so that it might be said of it with
good reason, “In the hearing of the ear it hath obeyed me,” for “faith is by hearing.”1088
This people, I say, added to those who are the true Israelites both by the flesh and by faith,
is the city of God, which has brought forth Christ Himself according to the flesh, since He
was in these Israelites only. For thence came the Virgin Mary, in whom Christ assumed
flesh that He might be man. Of which city another psalm says, “Mother Sion, shall a man

say, and the man is made in her, and the Highest Himself hath founded her.”1089 Who is
this Highest, save God? And thus Christ, who is God, before He became man through Mary
in that city, Himself founded it by the patriarchs and prophets. As therefore was said by
prophecy so long before to this queen, the city of God, what we already can see fulfilled,
“Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee; thou shall make them princes over all the
earth;”1090 so out of her sons truly are set up even her fathers [princes] through all the earth,
when the people, coming together to her, confess to her with the confession of eternal praise
for ever and ever. Beyond doubt, whatever interpretation is put on what is here expressed
somewhat darkly in figurative language, ought to be in agreement with these most manifest
things.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Of Those Things in the 110th Psalm Which Relate to the Priesthood
of Christ, and in the 22d to His Passion.</head>
<p>Just as in that psalm also where Christ is most openly proclaimed as Priest, even as He
is here as King, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine
enemies Thy footstool.”1091 That Christ sits on the right hand of God the Father is believed,
not seen; that His enemies also are put under His feet doth not yet appear; it is being done,
[therefore] it will appear at last: yea, this is now believed, afterward it shall be seen. But
what follows, “The Lord will send forth the rod of Thy strength out of Sion, and rule Thou
in the midst of Thine enemies,”1092 is so clear, that to deny it would imply not merely unbelief
and mistake, but downright impudence. And even enemies must certainly confess that out
of Sion has been sent the law of Christ which we call the gospel, and acknowledge as the rod
of His strength. But that He rules in the midst of His enemies, these same enemies among
whom He rules themselves bear witness, gnashing their teeth and consuming away, and
having power to do nothing against Him. Then what he says a little after, “The Lord hath
sworn and will not repent,”1093 by which words He intimates that what He adds is immutable,
“Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek,”1094 who is permitted to doubt
of whom these things are said, seeing that now there is nowhere a priesthood and sacrifice
after the order of Aaron, and everywhere men offer under Christ as the Priest, which
Melchizedek showed when he blessed Abraham? Therefore to these manifest things are to
be referred, when rightly understood, those things in the same psalm that are set down a
little more obscurely, and we have already made known in our popular sermons how these
things are to be rightly understood. So also in that where Christ utters through prophecy
the humiliation of His passion, saying, “They pierced my hands and feet; they counted all
my bones. Yea, they looked and stared at me.”1095 By which words he certainly meant His
body stretched out on the cross, with the hands and feet pierced and perforated by the
striking through of the nails, and that He had in that way made Himself a spectacle to those
who looked and stared. And he adds, “They parted my garments among them, and over
my vesture they cast lots.”1096 How this prophecy has been fulfilled the Gospel history
narrates. Then, indeed, the other things also which are said there less openly are rightly
understood when they agree with those which shine with so great clearness; especially because
those things also which we do not believe as past, but survey as present, are beheld by the

<head>Chapter 18.—Of the 3d, 41st, 15th, and 68th Psalms, in Which the Death and Resurrection
of the Lord are Prophesied.</head>
<p>About His resurrection also the oracles of the Psalms are by no means silent. For what
else is it that is sung in His person in the 3d Psalm, “I laid me down and took a sleep, [and]
I awaked, for the Lord shall sustain me?”1097 Is there perchance any one so stupid as to
believe that the prophet chose to point it out to us as something great that He had slept and
risen up, unless that sleep had been death, and that awaking the resurrection, which behoved
to be thus prophesied concerning Christ? For in the 41st Psalm also it is shown much more
clearly, where in the person of the Mediator, in the usual way, things are narrated as if past
which were prophesied as yet to come, since these things which were yet to come were in
the predestination and foreknowledge of God as if they were done, because they were certain.
He says, “Mine enemies speak evil of me; When shall he die, and his name perish? And if
he came in to see me, his heart spake vain things: he gathered iniquity to himself. He went
out of doors, and uttered it all at once. Against me all mine enemies whisper together:
against me do they devise evil. They have planned an unjust thing against me. Shall not he
that sleeps also rise again?”1098 These words are certainly so set down here that he may be
understood to say nothing else than if he said, Shall not He that died recover life again?
The previous words clearly show that His enemies have mediated and planned His death,
and that this was executed by him who came in to see, and went out to betray. But to whom
does not Judas here occur, who, from being His disciple, became His betrayer? Therefore
because they were about to do what they had plotted,—that is, were about to kill Him,—he,
to show them that with useless malice they were about to kill Him who should rise again,
so adds this verse, as if he said, What vain thing are you doing? What will be your crime
will be my sleep. “Shall not He that sleeps also rise again?” And yet he indicates in the following

Lord Jesus Himself, in pointing out that very man to the apostles as His betrayer, quoted
this very verse of this psalm, and said it was fulfilled in Himself: “He that ate my bread enlarged
the heel over me.” But what he says, “In whom I trusted,” does not suit the head but
the body. For the Saviour Himself was not ignorant of him concerning whom He had
already said before, “One of you is a devil.”1102 But He is wont to assume the person of His
members, and to ascribe to Himself what should be said of them, because the head and the
body is one Christ;1103 whence that saying in the Gospel, “I was an hungered, and ye gave
me to eat.”1104 Expounding which, He says, “Since ye did it to one of the least of mine, ye
did it to me.”1105 Therefore He said that He had trusted, because his disciples then had
trusted concerning Judas; for he was numbered with the apostles.1106</p>
<p>But the Jews do not expect that the Christ whom they expect will die; therefore they do
not think ours to be Him whom the law and the prophets announced, but feign to themselves
I know not whom of their own, exempt from the suffering of death. Therefore, with wonderful
emptiness and blindness, they contend that the words we have set down signify, not
death and resurrection, but sleep and awaking again. But the 16th Psalm also cries to them,
“Therefore my heart is jocund, and my tongue hath exulted; moreover, my flesh also shall
rest in hope: for Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt Thou give Thine Holy One
to see corruption.”1107 Who but He that rose again the third day could say his flesh had
rested in this hope; that His soul, not being left in hell, but speedily returning to it, should
revive it, that it should not be corrupted as corpses are wont to be, which they can in no
wise say of David the prophet and king? The 68th Psalm also cries out, “Our God is the
God of Salvation: even of the Lord the exit was by death.”1108 What could be more openly
said? For the God of salvation is the Lord Jesus, which is interpreted Saviour, or Healing
One. For this reason this name was given, when it was said before He was born of the virgin:
“Thou shall bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people
from their sins.”1109 Because His blood was shed for the remission of their sins, it behoved
Him to have no other exit from this life than death. Therefore, when it had been said, “Our
God is the God of salvation,” immediately it was added, “Even of the Lord the exit was by
death,” in order to show that we were to be saved by His dying. But that saying is marvellous,

<head>Chapter 19.—Of the 69th Psalm, in Which the Obstinate Unbelief of the Jews is
Declared.</head>
<p>But when the Jews will not in the least yield to the testimonies of this prophecy, which
are so manifest, and are also brought by events to so clear and certain a completion, certainly
that is fulfilled in them which is written in that psalm which here follows. For when the
things which pertain to His passion are prophetically spoken there also in the person of
Christ, that is mentioned which is unfolded in the Gospel: “They gave me gall for my meat;
and in my thirst they gave me vinegar for drink.”1110 And as it were after such a feast and
dainties in this way given to Himself, presently He brings in [these words]: “Let their table
become a trap before them, and a retribution, and an offence: let their eyes be dimmed that
they see not, and their back be always bowed down,”1111 etc. Which things are not spoken
as wished for, but are predicted under the prophetic form of wishing. What wonder, then,
if those whose eyes are dimmed that they see not do not see these manifest things? What
wonder if those do not look up at heavenly things whose back is always bowed down that
they may grovel among earthly things? For these words transferred from the body signify
mental faults. Let these things which have been said about the Psalms, that is, about king
David’s prophecy, suffice, that we may keep within some bound. But let those readers excuse
us who knew them all before; and let them not complain about those perhaps stronger proofs
which they know or think I have passed by.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Of David’s Reign and Merit; And of His Son Solomon, and that
Prophecy Relating to Christ Which is Found Either in Those Books Which are
Joined to Those Written by Him, or in Those Which are Indubitably His.</head>
<p>David therefore reigned in the earthly Jerusalem, a son of the heavenly Jerusalem, much
praised by the divine testimony; for even his faults are overcome by great piety, through the
most salutary humility of his repentance, that he is altogether one of those of whom he
himself says, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.”1112
After him Solomon his son reigned over the same whole people, who, as was said before,
began to reign while his father was still alive. This man, after good beginnings, made a bad
end. For indeed “prosperity, which wears out the minds of the wise,”1113 hurt him more
than that wisdom profited him, which even yet is and shall hereafter be renowned, and was
then praised far and wide. He also is found to have prophesied in his books, of which three
are received as of canonical authority, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. But it
has been customary to ascribe to Solomon other two, of which one is called Wisdom, the
other Ecclesiasticus, on account of some resemblance of style,—but the more learned have
no doubt that they are not his; yet of old the Church, especially the Western, received them
into authority,—in the one of which, called the Wisdom of Solomon, the passion of Christ
is most openly prophesied. For indeed His impious murderers are quoted as saying, “Let
us lie in wait for the righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and contrary to our works; and
he upbraideth us with our transgressions of the law, and objecteth to our disgrace the
transgressions of our education. He professeth to have the knowledge of God, and he calleth
himself the Son of God. He was made to reprove our thoughts. He is grievous for as even
to behold; for his life is unlike other men’s and his ways are different. We are esteemed of
him as counterfeits; and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness. He extols the latter
end of the righteous; and glorieth that he hath God for his Father. Let us see, therefore, if
his words be true; and let us try what shall happen to him, and we shall know what shall be
the end of him. For if the righteous be the Son of God, He will undertake for him, and deliver
him out of the hand of those that are against him. Let us put him to the question with
contumely and torture, that we may know his reverence, and prove his patience. Let us
condemn him to the most shameful death; for by His own sayings He shall be respected.
These things did they imagine, and were mistaken; for their own malice hath quite blinded
them.”1114 But in Ecclesiasticus the future faith of the nations is predicted in this manner:
“Have mercy upon us, O God, Ruler of all, and send Thy fear upon all the nations: lift up
Thine hand over the strange nations, and let them see Thy power. As Thou wast sanctified

in us before them, so be Thou sanctified in them before us, and let them acknowledge Thee,
according as we also have acknowledged Thee; for there is not a God beside Thee, O
Lord.”1115 We see this prophecy in the form of a wish and prayer fulfilled through Jesus
Christ. But the things which are not written in the canon of the Jews cannot be quoted
against their contradictions with so great validity.</p>
<p>But as regards those three books which it is evident are Solomon’s and held canonical
by the Jews, to show what of this kind may be found in them pertaining to Christ and the
Church demands a laborious discussion, which, if now entered on, would lengthen this
work unduly. Yet what we read in the Proverbs of impious men saying, “Let us unrighteously
hide in the earth the righteous man; yea, let us swallow him up alive as hell, and let us take
away his memory from the earth: let us seize his precious possession,”1116 is not so obscure
that it may not be understood, without laborious exposition, of Christ and His possession
the Church. Indeed, the gospel parable about the wicked husbandmen shows that our Lord
Jesus Himself said something like it: “This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inherit-
ance shall be ours.”1117 In like manner also that passage in this same book, on which we
have already touched1118 when we were speaking of the barren woman who hath born
seven, must soon after it was uttered have come to be understood of only Christ and the
Church by those who knew that Christ was the Wisdom of God. “Wisdom hath builded
her an house, and hath set up seven pillars; she hath sacrificed her victims, she hath mingled
her wine in the bowl; she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent her servants summoning
to the bowl with excellent proclamation, saying, Who is simple, let him turn aside to
me. And to the void of sense she hath said, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine
which I have mingled for you.”1119 Here certainly we perceive that the Wisdom of God,
that is, the Word co-eternal with the Father, hath builded Him an house, even a human
body in the virgin womb, and hath subjoined the Church to it as members to a head, hath
slain the martyrs as victims, hath furnished a table with wine and bread, where appears also
the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, and hath called the simple and the void of
sense, because, as saith the apostle, “He hath chosen the weak things of this world that He
might confound the things which are mighty.”1120 Yet to these weak ones she saith what
follows, “Forsake simplicity, that ye may live; and seek prudence, that ye may have life.”1121

But to be made partakers of this table is itself to begin to have life. For when he says in another
book, which is called Ecclesiastes, “There is no good for a man, except that he should
eat and drink,”1122 what can he be more credibly understood to say, than what belongs to
the participation of this table which the Mediator of the New Testament Himself, the Priest
after the order of Melchizedek, furnishes with His own body and blood? For that sacrifice
has succeeded all the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which were slain as a shadow of that
which was to come; wherefore also we recognize the voice in the 40th Psalm as that of the
same Mediator speaking through prophesy, “Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire;
but a body hast Thou perfected for me.”1123 Because, instead of all these sacrifices and oblations,
His body is offered, and is served up to the partakers of it. For that this Ecclesiastes,
in this sentence about eating and drinking, which he often repeats, and very much commends,
does not savor the dainties of carnal pleasures, is made plain enough when he says, “It is
better to go into the house of mourning than to go into the house of feasting.”1124 And a
little after He says, “The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, and the heart of the
simple in the house of feasting.”1125 But I think that more worthy of quotation from this
book which relates to both cities, the one of the devil, the other of Christ, and to their kings,
the devil and Christ: “Woe to thee, O land,” he says, “when thy king is a youth, and thy
princes eat in the morning! Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
and thy princes eat in season, in fortitude, and not in confusion!”1126 He has called the
devil a youth, because of the folly and pride, and rashness and unruliness, and other vices
which are wont to abound at that age; but Christ is the Son of nobles, that is, of the holy
patriarchs, of those belonging to the free city, of whom He was begotten in the flesh. The
princes of that and other cities are eaters in the morning, that is, before the suitable hour,
because they do not expect the seasonable felicity, which is the true, in the world to come,
desiring to be speedily made happy with the renown of this world; but the princes of the
city of Christ patiently wait for the time of a blessedness that is not fallacious. This is expressed
by the words, “in fortitude, and not in confusion,” because hope does not deceive
them; of which the apostle says, “But hope maketh not ashamed.”1127 A psalm also saith,
“For they that hope in Thee shall not be put to shame.”1128 But now the Song of Songs is
a certain spiritual pleasure of holy minds, in the marriage of that King and Queen-city, that

Bridegroom may be more ardently desired, and more joyfully unveiled, and may appear; to
whom it is said in this same song, “Equity hath delighted Thee;1129 and the bride who there
hears, “Charity is in thy delights.”1130 We pass over many things in silence, in our desire

<head>Chapter 21.—Of the Kings After Solomon, Both in Judah and Israel.</head>
<p>The other kings of the Hebrews after Solomon are scarcely found to have prophesied,
through certain enigmatic words or actions of theirs, what may pertain to Christ and the
Church, either in Judah or Israel; for so were the parts of that people styled, when, on account
of Solomon’s offence, from the time of Rehoboam his son, who succeeded him in the
kingdom, it was divided by God as a punishment. The ten tribes, indeed, which Jeroboam
the servant of Solomon received, being appointed the king in Samaria, were distinctively
called Israel, although this had been the name of that whole people; but the two tribes,
namely, of Judah and Benjamin, which for David’s sake, lest the kingdom should be wholly
wrenched from his race, remained subject to the city of Jerusalem, were called Judah, because
that was the tribe whence David sprang. But Benjamin, the other tribe which, as was said,
belonged to the same kingdom, was that whence Saul sprang before David. But these two
tribes together, as was said, were called Judah, and were distinguished by this name from
Israel which was the distinctive title of the ten tribes under their own king. For the tribe of
Levi, because it was the priestly one, bound to the servitude of God, not of the kings, was
reckoned the thirteenth. For Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Israel, did not, like the others,
form one tribe, but two, Ephraim and Manasseh. Yet the tribe of Levi also belonged more
to the kingdom of Jerusalem, where was the temple of God whom it served. On the division
of the people, therefore, Rehoboam, son of Solomon, reigned in Jerusalem as the first king
of Judah, and Jeroboam, servant of Solomon, in Samaria as king of Israel. And when Rehoboam
wished as a tyrant to pursue that separated part with war, the people were prohibited
from fighting with their brethren by God, who told them through a prophet that He had
done this; whence it appeared that in this matter there had been no sin either of the king or
people of Israel, but the accomplished will of God the avenger. When this was known, both
parts settled down peaceably, for the division made was not religious but political.</p>

<p>But Jeroboam king of Israel, with perverse mind, not believing in God, whom he had
proved true in promising and giving him the kingdom, was afraid lest, by coming to the
temple of God which was in Jerusalem, where, according to the divine law, that whole nation
was to come in order to sacrifice, the people should be seduced from him, and return to
David’s line as the seed royal; and set up idolatry in his kingdom, and with horrible impiety
beguiled the people, ensnaring them to the worship of idols with himself. Yet God did not
altogether cease to reprove by the prophets, not only that king, but also his successors and
imitators in his impiety, and the people too. For there the great and illustrious prophet
Elijah and Elisha his disciple arose, who also did many wonderful works. Even there, when
Elijah said, “O Lord, they have slain Thy prophets, they have digged down Thine altars; and
I am left alone, and they seek my life,” it was answered that seven thousand men were there
who had not bowed the knee to Baal.1131</p>

<p>So also in the kingdom of Judah pertaining to Jerusalem prophets were not lacking even
in the times of succeeding kings, just as it pleased God to send them, either for the prediction
of what was needful, or for correction of sin and instruction in righteousness;1132 for there,
too, although far less than in Israel, kings arose who grievously offended God by their impieties,
and, along with their people, who were like them, were smitten with moderate scourges.
The no small merits of the pious kings there are praised indeed. But we read that in Israel
the kings were, some more, others less, yet all wicked. Each part, therefore, as the divine
providence either ordered or permitted, was both lifted up by prosperity and weighed down
by adversity of various kinds; and it was afflicted not only by foreign, but also by civil wars
with each other, in order that by certain existing causes the mercy or anger of God might
be manifested; until, by His growing indignation, that whole nation was by the conquering
Chaldeans not only overthrown in its abode, but also for the most part transported to the
lands of the Assyrians,—first, that part of the thirteen tribes called Israel, but afterwards
Judah also, when Jerusalem and that most noble temple was cast down,—in which lands it
rested seventy years in captivity. Being after that time sent forth thence, they rebuilt the
overthrown temple. And although very many stayed in the lands of the strangers, yet the
kingdom no longer had two separate parts, with different kings over each, but in Jerusalem
there was one prince over them; and at certain times, from every direction wherever they
were, and from whatever place they could, they all came to the temple of God which was
there. Yet not even then were they without foreign enemies and conquerors; yea, Christ
found them tributaries of the Romans.</p>

<p>But in that whole time after they returned from Babylon, after Malachi, Haggai, and
Zechariah, who then prophesied, and Ezra, they had no prophets down to the time of the
Saviour’s advent except another Zechariah, the father of John, and Elisabeth his wife, when
the nativity of Christ was already close at hand; and when He was already born, Simeon the
aged, and Anna a widow, and now very old; and, last of all, John himself, who, being a young
man, did not predict that Christ, now a young man, was to come, but by prophetic knowledge
pointed Him out though unknown; for which reason the Lord Himself says, “The law and
the prophets were until John.”1133 But the prophesying of these five is made known to us
in the gospel, where the virgin mother of our Lord herself is also found to have prophesied
before John. But this prophecy of theirs the wicked Jews do not receive; but those innumerable
persons received it who from them believed the gospel. For then truly Israel was divided
in two, by that division which was foretold by Samuel the prophet to king Saul as immutable.
But even the reprobate Jews hold Malachi, Haggai, Zechariah, and Ezra as the last received
into canonical authority. For there are also writings of these, as of others, who being but a
very few in the great multitude of prophets, have written those books which have obtained
canonical authority, of whose predictions it seems good to me to put in this work some

<head>Chapter 1.—Of Those Things Down to the Times of the Saviour Which Have Been
Discussed in the Seventeen Books.</head>
<p>I Promised to write of the rise, progress, and appointed end of the two cities, one of
which is God’s, the other this world’s, in which, so far as mankind is concerned, the former
is now a stranger. But first of all I undertook, so far as His grace should enable me, to refute
the enemies of the city of God, who prefer their gods to Christ its founder, and fiercely hate
Christians with the most deadly malice. And this I have done in the first ten books. Then,
as regards my threefold promise which I have just mentioned, I have treated distinctly, in
the four books which follow the tenth, of the rise of both cities. After that, I have proceeded
from the first man down to the flood in one book, which is the fifteenth of this work; and
from that again down to Abraham our work has followed both in chronological order.
From the patriarch Abraham down to the time of the Israelite kings, at which we close our
sixteenth book, and thence down to the advent of Christ Himself in the flesh, to which
period the seventeenth book reaches, the city of God appears from my way of writing to
have run its course alone; whereas it did not run its course alone in this age, for both cities,
in their course amid mankind, certainly experienced chequered times together just as from
the beginning. But I did this in order that, first of all, from the time when the promises of
God began to be more clear, down to the virgin birth of Him in whom those things promised
from the first were to be fulfilled, the course of that city which is God’s might be made more
distinctly apparent, without interpolation of foreign matter from the history of the other
city, although down to the revelation of the new covenant it ran its course, not in light, but
in shadow. Now, therefore, I think fit to do what I passed by, and show, so far as seems
necessary, how that other city ran its course from the times of Abraham, so that attentive
readers may compare the two.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Of the Kings and Times of the Earthly City Which Were Synchronous
with the Times of the Saints, Reckoning from the Rise of Abraham.</head>
<p>The society of mortals spread abroad through the earth everywhere, and in the most
diverse places, although bound together by a certain fellowship of our common nature, is
yet for the most part divided against itself, and the strongest oppress the others, because all
follow after their own interests and lusts, while what is longed for either suffices for none,
or not for all, because it is not the very thing. For the vanquished succumb to the victorious,
preferring any sort of peace and safety to freedom itself; so that they who chose to die rather
than be slaves have been greatly wondered at. For in almost all nations the very voice of
nature somehow proclaims, that those who happen to be conquered should choose rather
to be subject to their conquerors than to be killed by all kinds of warlike destruction. This
does not take place without the providence of God, in whose power it lies that any one either
subdues or is subdued in war; that some are endowed with kingdoms, others made subject
to kings. Now, among the very many kingdoms of the earth into which, by earthly interest
or lust, society is divided (which we call by the general name of the city of this world), we
see that two, settled and kept distinct from each other both in time and place, have grown
far more famous than the rest, first that of the Assyrians, then that of the Romans. First
came the one, then the other. The former arose in the east, and, immediately on its close,
the latter in the west. I may speak of other kingdoms and other kings as appendages of
these.</p>
<p>Ninus, then, who succeeded his father Belus, the first king of Assyria, was already the
second king of that kingdom when Abraham was born in the land of the Chaldees. There
was also at that time a very small kingdom of Sicyon, with which, as from an ancient date,
that most universally learned man Marcus Varro begins, in writing of the Roman race. For
from these kings of Sicyon he passes to the Athenians, from them to the Latins, and from
these to the Romans. Yet very little is related about these kingdoms, before the foundation
of Rome, in comparison with that of Assyria. For although even Sallust, the Roman historian,
admits that the Athenians were very famous in Greece, yet he thinks they were greater
in fame than in fact. For in speaking of them he says, “The deeds of the Athenians, as I
think, were very great and magnificent, but yet somewhat less than reported by fame. But
because writers of great genius arose among them, the deeds of the Athenians were celebrated
throughout the world as very great. Thus the virtue of those who did them was held to be
as great as men of transcendent genius could represent it to be by the power of laudatory
words.”1134 This city also derived no small glory from literature and philosophy, the study
of which chiefly flourished there. But as regards empire, none in the earliest times was
greater than the Assyrian, or so widely extended. For when Ninus the son of Belus was king,
<note type="footnote">1134 Sallust, Bell. Cat. c. 8.</note>

<pb n="828"/>
he is reported to have subdued the whole of Asia, even to the boundaries of Libya, which
as to number is called the third part, but as to size is found to be the half of the whole world.
The Indians in the eastern regions were the only people over whom he did not reign; but
after his death Semiramis his wife made war on them. Thus it came to pass that all the
people and kings in those countries were subject to the kingdom and authority of the Assyrians,
and did whatever they were commanded. Now Abraham was born in that kingdom
among the Chaldees, in the time of Ninus. But since Grecian affairs are much better known
to us than Assyrian, and those who have diligently investigated the antiquity of the Roman
nation’s origin have followed the order of time through the Greeks to the Latins, and from
them to the Romans, who themselves are Latins, we ought on this account, where it is
needful, to mention the Assyrian kings, that it may appear how Babylon, like a first Rome,
ran its course along with the city of God, which is a stranger in this world. But the things
proper for insertion in this work in comparing the two cities, that is, the earthly and heavenly,
ought to be taken mostly from the Greek and Latin kingdoms, where Rome herself is like a
second Babylon.</p>
<p>At Abraham’s birth, then, the second kings of Assyria and Sicyon respectively were
Ninus and Europs, the first having been Belus and Ægialeus. But when God promised Abraham,
on his departure from Babylonia, that he should become a great nation, and that in
his seed all nations of the earth should be blessed, the Assyrians had their seventh king, the
Sicyons their fifth; for the son of Ninus reigned among them after his mother Semiramis,
who is said to have been put to death by him for attempting to defile him by incestuously
lying with him. Some think that she founded Babylon, and indeed she may have founded
it anew. But we have told, in the sixteenth book, when or by whom it was founded. Now
the son of Ninus and Semiramis, who succeeded his mother in the kingdom, is also called
Ninus by some, but by others Ninias, a patronymic word. Telexion then held the kingdom
of the Sicyons. In his reign times were quiet and joyful to such a degree, that after his death
they worshipped him as a god by offering sacrifices and by celebrating games, which are
said to have been first instituted on this occasion.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—What Kings Reigned in Assyria and Sicyon When, According to the
Promise, Isaac Was Born to Abraham in His Hundredth Year, and When the
Twins Esau and Jacob Were Born of Rebecca to Isaac in His Sixtieth Year.</head>
<p>In his times also, by the promise of God, Isaac, the son of Abraham, was born to his
father when he was a hundred years old, of Sarah his wife, who, being barren and old, had
already lost hope of issue. Aralius was then the fifth king of the Assyrians. To Isaac himself,
in his sixtieth year, were born twin-sons, Esau and Jacob, whom Rebecca his wife bore to
him, their grandfather Abraham, who died on completing a hundred and seventy years,
being still alive, and reckoning his hundred and sixtieth year.1135 At that time there reigned
as the seventh kings,—among the Assyrians, that more ancient Xerxes, who was also called
Balæus; and among the Sicyons, Thuriachus, or, as some write his name, Thurimachus.
The kingdom of Argos, in which Inachus reigned first, arose in the time of Abraham’s
grandchildren. And I must not omit what Varro relates, that the Sicyons were also wont to
sacrifice at the tomb of their seventh king Thuriachus. In the reign of Armamitres in Assyria
and Leucippus in Sicyon as the eighth kings, and of Inachus as the first in Argos, God spoke
to Isaac, and promised the same two things to him as to his father,—namely, the land of
Canaan to his seed, and the blessing of all nations in his seed. These same things were
promised to his son, Abraham’s grandson, who was at first called Jacob, afterwards Israel,
when Belocus was the ninth king of Assyria, and Phoroneus, the son of Inachus, reigned as
the second king of Argos, Leucippus still continuing king of Sicyon. In those times, under
the Argive king Phoroneus, Greece was made more famous by the institution of certain laws
and judges. On the death of Phoroneus, his younger brother Phegous built a temple at his
tomb, in which he was worshipped as God, and oxen were sacrificed to him. I believe they
thought him worthy of so great honor, because in his part of the kingdom (for their father
had divided his territories between them, in which they reigned during his life) he had
founded chapels for the worship of the gods, and had taught them to measure time, by
months and years, and to that extent to keep count and reckoning of events. Men still uncultivated,
admiring him for these novelties, either fancied he was, or resolved that he should
be made, a god after his death. Io also is said to have been the daughter of Inachus, who
was afterwards called Isis, when she was worshipped in Egypt as a great goddess; although
others write that she came as a queen out of Ethiopia, and because she ruled extensively and
justly, and instituted for her subjects letters and many useful things, such divine honor was
given her there after she died, that if any one said she had been human, he was charged with
a capital crime.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Of the Times of Jacob and His Son Joseph.</head>
<p>In the reign of Balæus, the ninth king of Assyria, and Mesappus, the eighth of Sicyon,
who is said by some to have been also called Cephisos (if indeed the same man had both
names, and those who put the other name in their writings have not rather confounded him
with another man), while Apis was third king of Argos, Isaac died, a hundred and eighty
years old, and left his twin-sons a hundred and twenty years old. Jacob, the younger of
these, belonged to the city of God about which we write (the elder being wholly rejected),
and had twelve sons, one of whom, called Joseph, was sold by his brothers to merchants
going down to Egypt, while his grandfather Isaac was still alive. But when he was thirty
years of age, Joseph stood before Pharaoh, being exalted out of the humiliation he endured,
because, in divinely interpreting the king’s dreams, he foretold that there would be seven
years of plenty, the very rich abundance of which would be consumed by seven other years
of famine that should follow. On this account the king made him ruler over Egypt, liberating
him from prison, into which he had been thrown for keeping his chastity intact; for he
bravely preserved it from his mistress, who wickedly loved him, and told lies to his weakly
credulous master, and did not consent to commit adultery with her, but fled from her,
leaving his garment in her hands when she laid hold of him. In the second of the seven
years of famine Jacob came down into Egypt to his son with all he had, being a hundred and
thirty years old, as he himself said in answer to the king’s question. Joseph was then thirtynine,
if we add seven years of plenty and two of famine to the thirty he reckoned when
honored by the king.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of Apis King of Argos, Whom the Egyptians Called Serapis, and Worshipped
with Divine Honors.</head>
<p>In these times Apis king of Argos crossed over into Egypt in ships, and, on dying there,
was made Serapis, the chief god of all the Egyptians. Now Varro gives this very ready reason
why, after his death, he was called, not Apis, but Serapis. The ark in which he was placed
when dead, which every one now calls a sarcophagus, was then called in Greek σορὸς, and
they began to worship him when buried in it before his temple was built; and from Soros
and Apis he was called first [Sorosapis, or] Sorapis, and then Serapis, by changing a letter,
as easily happens. It was decreed regarding him also, that whoever should say he had been
a man should be capitally punished. And since in every temple where Isis and Serapis were
worshipped there was also an image which, with finger pressed on the lips, seemed to warn
men to keep silence, Varro thinks this signifies that it should be kept secret that they had
been human. But that bull which, with wonderful folly, deluded Egypt nourished with
abundant delicacies in honor of him, was not called Serapis, but Apis, because they worshipped
him alive without a sarcophagus. On the death of that bull, when they sought and
found a calf of the same color,—that is, similarly marked with certain white spots,—they
believed it was something miraculous, and divinely provided for them. Yet it was no great
thing for the demons, in order to deceive them, to show to a cow when she was conceiving
and pregnant the image of such a bull, which she alone could see, and by it attract the
breeding passion of the mother, so that it might appear in a bodily shape in her young, just
as Jacob so managed with the spotted rods that the sheep and goats were born spotted. For
what men can do with real colors and substances, the demons can very easily do by showing
unreal forms to breeding animals.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Who Were Kings of Argos, and of Assyria, When Jacob Died in Egypt.</head>
<p>Apis, then, who died in Egypt, was not the king of Egypt, but of Argos. He was succeeded
by his son Argus, from whose name the land was called Argos and the people Argives, for
under the earlier kings neither the place nor the nation as yet had this name. While he then
reigned over Argos, and Eratus over Sicyon, and Balæus still remained king of Assyria, Jacob
died in Egypt a hundred and forty-seven years old, after he had, when dying, blessed his
sons and his grandsons by Joseph, and prophesied most plainly of Christ, saying in the
blessing of Judah, “A prince shall not fail out of Judah, nor a leader from his thighs, until
those things come which are laid up for him; and He is the expectation of the nations.”1136
In the reign of Argus, Greece began to use fruits, and to have crops of corn in cultivated
fields, the seed having been brought from other countries. Argus also began to be accounted
a god after his death, and was honored with a temple and sacrifices. This honor was conferred
in his reign, before being given to him, on a private individual for being the first to yoke
oxen in the plough. This was one Homogyrus, who was struck by lightning.</p>

years old. After his death, the people of God, increasing wonderfully, remained in Egypt a
hundred and forty-five years, in tranquillity at first, until those who knew Joseph were dead.
Afterward, through envy of their increase, and the suspicion that they would at length gain
their freedom, they were oppressed with persecutions and the labors of intolerable servitude,
amid which, however, they still grew, being multiplied with God-given fertility. During this
period the same kingdoms continued in Assyria and Greece.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Who Were Kings When Moses Was Born, and What Gods Began to
Be Worshipped Then.</head>
<p>When Saphrus reigned as the fourteenth king of Assyria, and Orthopolis as the twelfth
of Sicyon, and Criasus as the fifth of Argos, Moses was born in Egypt, by whom the people
of God were liberated from the Egyptian slavery, in which they behoved to be thus tried
that they might desire the help of their Creator. Some have thought that Prometheus lived
during the reign of the kings now named. He is reported to have formed men out of clay,
because he was esteemed the best teacher of wisdom; yet it does not appear what wise men
there were in his days. His brother Atlas is said to have been a great astrologer; and this
gave occasion for the fable that he held up the sky, although the vulgar opinion about his
holding up the sky appears rather to have been suggested by a high mountain named after
him. Indeed, from those times many other fabulous things began to be invented in Greece;
yet, down to Cecrops king of Athens, in whose reign that city received its name, and in
whose reign God brought His people out of Egypt by Moses, only a few dead heroes are reported
to have been deified according to the vain superstition of the Greeks. Among these
were Melantomice, the wife of king Criasus, and Phorbas their son, who succeeded his
father as sixth king of the Argives, and Iasus, son of Triopas, their seventh king, and their
ninth king, Sthenelas, or Stheneleus, or Sthenelus,—for his name is given differently by
different authors. In those times also, Mercury, the grandson of Atlas by his daughter Maia,
is said to have lived, according to the common report in books. He was famous for his skill
in many arts, and taught them to men, for which they resolved to make him, and even believed
that he deserved to be, a god after death. Hercules is said to have been later, yet belonging
to the same period; although some, whom I think mistaken, assign him an earlier
date than Mercury. But at whatever time they were born, it is agreed among grave historians,
who have committed these ancient things to writing, that both were men, and that they
merited divine honors from mortals because they conferred on them many benefits to make
this life more pleasant to them. Minerva was far more ancient than these; for she is reported
to have appeared in virgin age in the times of Ogyges at the lake called Triton, from which
she is also styled Tritonia, the inventress truly of many works, and the more readily believed
to be a goddess because her origin was so little known. For what is sung about her having
sprung from the head of Jupiter belongs to the region of poetry and fable, and not to that
of history and real fact. And historical writers are not agreed when Ogyges flourished, in
whose time also a great flood occurred,—not that greatest one from which no man escaped
except those who could get into the ark, for neither Greek nor Latin history knew of it, yet
a greater flood than that which happened afterward in Deucalion’s time. For Varro begins
the book I have already mentioned at this date, and does not propose to himself, as the
starting-point from which he may arrive at Roman affairs, anything more ancient than the
flood of Ogyges, that is, which happened in the time of Ogyges. Now our writers of chron-

<pb n="835"/>
icles—first Eusebius, and afterwards Jerome, who entirely follow some earlier historians in
this opinion—relate that the flood of Ogyges happened more than three hundred years after,
during the reign of Phoroneus, the second king of Argos. But whenever he may have lived,
Minerva was already worshipped as a goddess when Cecrops reigned in Athens, in whose
reign the city itself is reported to have been rebuilt or founded.</p>

<pb n="836"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—When the City of Athens Was Founded, and What Reason Varro Assigns
for Its Name.</head>
<p>Athens certainly derived its name from Minerva, who in Greek is called ᾽Αθηνη, and
Varro points out the following reason why it was so called. When an olive-tree suddenly
appeared there, and water burst forth in another place, these prodigies moved the king to
send to the Delphic Apollo to inquire what they meant and what he should do. He answered
that the olive signified Minerva, the water Neptune, and that the citizens had it in their
power to name their city as they chose, after either of these two gods whose signs these were.
On receiving this oracle, Cecrops convoked all the citizens of either sex to give their vote,
for it was then the custom in those parts for the women also to take part in public deliberations.
When the multitude was consulted, the men gave their votes for Neptune, the women
for Minerva; and as the women had a majority of one, Minerva conquered. Then Neptune,
being enraged, laid waste the lands of the Athenians, by casting up the waves of the sea; for
the demons have no difficulty in scattering any waters more widely. The same authority
said, that to appease his wrath the women should be visited by the Athenians with the threefold
punishment—that they should no longer have any vote; that none of their children
should be named after their mothers; and that no one should call them Athenians. Thus
that city, the mother and nurse of liberal doctrines, and of so many and so great philosophers,
than whom Greece had nothing more famous and noble, by the mockery of demons about
the strife of their gods, a male and female, and from the victory of the female one through
the women, received the name of Athens; and, on being damaged by the vanquished god,
was compelled to punish the very victory of the victress, fearing the waters of Neptune more
than the arms of Minerva. For in the women who were thus punished, Minerva, who had
conquered, was conquered too, and could not even help her voters so far that, although the
right of voting was henceforth lost, and the mothers could not give their names to the children,
they might at least be allowed to be called Athenians, and to merit the name of that
goddess whom they had made victorious over a male god by giving her their votes. What
and how much could be said about this, if we had not to hasten to other things in our discourse,
is obvious.</p>

<pb n="837"/>
<head>Chapter 10.—What Varro Reports About the Term Areopagus, and About Deucalion’s
Flood.</head>
<p>Marcus Varro, however, is not willing to credit lying fables against the gods, lest he
should find something dishonoring to their majesty; and therefore he will not admit that
the Areopagus, the place where the Apostle Paul disputed with the Athenians, got this name
because Mars, who in Greek is called ἌΑρης, when he was charged with the crime of homicide,
and was judged by twelve gods in that field, was acquitted by the sentence of six; because
it was the custom, when the votes were equal, to acquit rather than condemn. Against this
opinion, which is much most widely published, he tries, from the notices of obscure books,
to support another reason for this name, lest the Athenians should be thought to have called
it Areopagus from the words” Mars” and “field,”1137 as if it were the field of Mars, to the
dishonor of the gods, forsooth, from whom he thinks lawsuits and judgments far removed.
And he asserts that this which is said about Mars is not less false than what is said about the
three goddesses, to wit, Juno, Minerva, and Venus, whose contest for the palm of beauty,
before Paris as judge, in order to obtain the golden apple, is not only related, but is celebrated
in songs and dances amid the applause of the theatres, in plays meant to please the gods
who take pleasure in these crimes of their own, whether real or fabled. Varro does not believe
these things, because they are incompatible with the nature of the gods and of morality; and
yet, in giving not a fabulous but a historic reason for the name of Athens, he inserts in his
books the strife between Neptune and Minerva as to whose name should be given to that
city, which was so great that, when they contended by the display of prodigies, even Apollo
dared not judge between them when consulted; but, in order to end the strife of the gods,
just as Jupiter sent the three goddesses we have named to Paris, so he sent them to men,
when Minerva won by the vote, and yet was defeated by the punishment of her own voters,
for she was unable to confer the title of Athenians on the women who were her friends, although
she could impose it on the men who were her opponents. In these times, when
Cranaos reigned at Athens as the successor of Cecrops, as Varro writes, but, according to
our Eusebius and Jerome, while Cecrops himself still remained, the flood occurred which
is called Deucalion’s, because it occurred chiefly in those parts of the earth in which he
reigned. But this flood did not at all reach Egypt or its vicinity.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—When Moses Led the People Out of Egypt; And Who Were Kings
When His Successor Joshua the Son of Nun Died.</head>
<p>Moses led the people out of Egypt in the last time of Cecrops king of Athens, when Ascatades
reigned in Assyria, Marathus in Sicyon, Triopas in Argos; and having led forth the
people, he gave them at Mount Sinai the law he received from God, which is called the Old
Testament, because it has earthly promises, and because, through Jesus Christ, there was to
be a New Testament, in which the kingdom of heaven should be promised. For the same
order behoved to be observed in this as is observed in each man who prospers in God, according
to the saying of the apostle, “That is not first which is spiritual, but that which is
natural,” since, as he says, and that truly, “The first man of the earth, is earthly; the second
man, from heaven, is heavenly.”1138 Now Moses ruled the people for forty years in the
wilderness, and died a hundred and twenty years old, after he had prophesied of Christ by
the types of carnal observances in the tabernacle, priesthood, and sacrifices, and many other
mystic ordinances. Joshua the son of Nun succeeded Moses, and settled in the land of
promise the people he had brought in, having by divine authority conquered the people by
whom it was formerly possessed. He also died, after ruling the people twenty-seven years
after the death of Moses, when Amyntas reigned in Assyria as the eighteenth king, Coracos
as the sixteenth in Sicyon, Danaos as the tenth in Argos, Ericthonius as the fourth in Athens.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Of the Rituals of False Gods Instituted by the Kings of Greece in the
Period from Israel’s Exodus from Egypt Down to the Death of Joshua the Son
of Nun.</head>
<p>During this period, that is, from Israel’s exodus from Egypt down to the death of Joshua
the son of Nun, through whom that people received the land of promise, rituals were instituted
to the false gods by the kings of Greece, which, by stated celebration, recalled the
memory of the flood, and of men’s deliverance from it, and of that troublous life they then
led in migrating to and fro between the heights and the plains. For even the Luperci,1139
when they ascend and descend the sacred path, are said to represent the men who sought
the mountain summits because of the inundation of water, and returned to the lowlands
on its subsidence. In those times, Dionysus, who was also called Father Liber, and was esteemed
a god after death, is said to have shown the vine to his host in Attica. Then the
musical games were instituted for the Delphic Apollo, to appease his anger, through which
they thought the regions of Greece were afflicted with barrenness, because they had not
defended his temple which Danaos burnt when he invaded those lands; for they were warned
by his oracle to institute these games. But king Ericthonius first instituted games to him in
Attica, and not to him only, but also to Minerva, in which games the olive was given as the
prize to the victors, because they relate that Minerva was the discoverer of that fruit, as Liber
was of the grape. In those years Europa is alleged to have been carried off by Xanthus king
of Crete (to whom we find some give another name), and to have borne him Rhadamanthus,
Sarpedon, and Minos, who are more commonly reported to have been the sons of Jupiter
by the same woman. Now those who worship such gods regard what we have said about
Xanthus king of Crete as true history; but this about Jupiter, which the poets sing, the theatres
applaud, and the people celebrate, as empty fable got up as a reason for games to appease
the deities, even with the false ascription of crimes to them. In those times Hercules was
held in honor in Tyre, but that was not the same one as he whom we spoke of above. In the
more secret history there are said to have been several who were called Father Liber and
Hercules. This Hercules, whose great deeds are reckoned as twelve (not including the
slaughter of Antæus the African, because that affair pertains to another Hercules), is declared
in their books to have burned himself on Mount OEta, because he was not able, by that
strength with which he had subdued monsters, to endure the disease under which he languished.
At that time the king, or rather tyrant Busiris, who is alleged to have been the son
of Neptune by Libya the daughter of Epaphus, is said to have offered up his guests in sacrifice
to the gods. Now it must not be believed that Neptune committed this adultery, lest the
gods should be criminated; yet such things must be ascribed to them by the poets and in
the theatres, that they may be pleased with them. Vulcan and Minerva are said to have been
<note type="footnote">1139 The priests who officiated at the Lupercalia.</note>

<pb n="840"/>
the parents of Ericthonius king of Athens, in whose last years Joshua the son of Nun is found
to have died. But since they will have it that Minerva is a virgin, they say that Vulcan, being
disturbed in the struggle between them, poured out his seed into the earth, and on that account
the man born of it received that name; for in the Greek language ἔρις is “strife,” and
χθὼν “earth,” of which two words Ericthonius is a compound. Yet it must be admitted that
the more learned disprove and disown such things concerning their gods, and declare that
this fabulous belief originated in the fact that in the temple at Athens, which Vulcan and
Minerva had in common, a boy who had been exposed was found wrapped up in the coils
of a dragon, which signified that he would become great, and, as his parents were unknown,
he was called the son of Vulcan and Minerva, because they had the temple in common. Yet
that fable accounts for the origin of his name better than this history. But what does it
matter to us? Let the one in books that speak the truth edify religious men, and the other
in lying fables delight impure demons. Yet these religious men worship them as gods. Still,
while they deny these things concerning them they cannot clear them of all crime, because
at their demand they exhibit plays in which the very things they wisely deny are basely done,
and the gods are appeased by these false and base things. Now, even although the play celebrates
an unreal crime of the gods, yet to delight in the ascription of an unreal crime is a
real one.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—What Fables Were Invented at the Time When Judges Began to Rule
the Hebrews.</head>
<p>After the death of Joshua the son of Nun, the people of God had judges, in whose times
they were alternately humbled by afflictions on account of their sins, and consoled by
prosperity through the compassion of God. In those times were invented the fables about
Triptolemus, who, at the command of Ceres, borne by winged snakes, bestowed corn on
the needy lands in flying over them; about that beast the Minotaur, which was shut up in
the Labyrinth, from which men who entered its inextricable mazes could find no exit; about
the Centaurs, whose form was a compound of horse and man; about Cerberus, the threeheaded
dog of hell; about Phryxus and his sister Hellas, who fled, borne by a winged ram;
about the Gorgon, whose hair was composed of serpents, and who turned those who looked
on her into stone; about Bellerophon, who was carried by a winged horse called Pegasus;
about Amphion, who charmed and attracted the stones by the sweetness of his harp; about
the artificer Dædalus and his son Icarus, who flew on wings they had fitted on; about OEdipus,
who compelled a certain four-footed monster with a human face, called a sphynx, to destroy
herself by casting herself headlong, having solved the riddle she was wont to propose as in-
soluble; about Antæus, who was the son of the earth, for which reason, on falling on the
earth, he was wont to rise up stronger, whom Hercules slew; and perhaps there are others
which I have forgotten. These fables, easily found in histories containing a true account of
events, bring us down to the Trojan war, at which Marcus Varro has closed his second book
about the race of the Roman people; and they are so skillfully invented by men as to involve
no scandal to the gods. But whoever have pretended as to Jupiter’s rape of Ganymede, a
very beautiful boy, that king Tantalus committed the crime, and the fable ascribed it to
Jupiter; or as to his impregnating Danäe as a golden shower, that it means that the woman’s
virtue was corrupted by gold: whether these things were really done or only fabled in those
days, or were really done by others and falsely ascribed to Jupiter, it is impossible to tell how
much wickedness must have been taken for granted in men’s hearts that they should be
thought able to listen to such lies with patience. And yet they willingly accepted them, when,
indeed, the more devotedly they worshipped Jupiter, they ought the more severely to have
punished those who durst say such things of him. But they not only were not angry at those
who invented these things, but were afraid that the gods would be angry at them if they did
not act such fictions even in the theatres. In those times Latona bore Apollo, not him of
whose oracle we have spoken above as so often consulted, but him who is said, along with
Hercules, to have fed the flocks of king Admetus; yet he was so believed to be a god, that
very many, indeed almost all, have believed him to be the selfsame Apollo. Then also
Father Liber made war in India, and led in his army many women called Bacchæ, who were
notable not so much for valor as for fury. Some, indeed, write that this Liber was both
conquered and bound and some that he was slain in Persia, even telling where he was buried;

and yet in his name, as that of a god, the unclean demons have instituted the sacred, or
rather the sacrilegious, Bacchanalia, of the outrageous vileness of which the senate, after
many years, became so much ashamed as to prohibit them in the city of Rome. Men believed
that in those times Perseus and his wife Andromeda were raised into heaven after their
death, so that they were not ashamed or afraid to mark out their images by constellations,

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Theological Poets.</head>
<p>During the same period of time arose the poets, who were also called theologues, because
they made hymns about the gods; yet about such gods as, although great men, were yet but
men, or the elements of this world which the true God made, or creatures who were ordained
as principalities and powers according to the will of the Creator and their own merit. And
if, among much that was vain and false, they sang anything of the one true God, yet, by
worshipping Him along with others who are not gods, and showing them the service that
is due to Him alone, they did not serve Him at all rightly; and even such poets as Orpheus,
Musæus, and Linus, were unable to abstain from dishonoring their gods by fables. But yet
these theologues worshipped the gods, and were not worshipped as gods, although the city
of the ungodly is wont, I know not how, to set Orpheus over the sacred, or rather sacrilegious,
rites of hell. The wife of king Athamas, who was called Ino, and her son Melicertes, perished
by throwing themselves into the sea, and were, according to popular belief, reckoned among
the gods, like other men of the same times, [among whom were] Castor and Pollux. The
Greeks, indeed, called her who was the mother of Melicertes, Leucothea, the Latins, Matuta;
but both thought her a goddess.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Of the Fall of the Kingdom of Argos, When Picus the Son of Saturn
First Received His Father’s Kingdom of Laurentum.</head>
<p>During those times the kingdom of Argos came to an end; being transferred to Mycene,
from which Agamemnon came, and the kingdom of Laurentum arose, of which Picus son
of Saturn was the first king, when the woman Deborah judged the Hebrews; but it was the
Spirit of God who used her as His agent, for she was also a prophetess, although her
prophecy is so obscure that we could not demonstrate, without a long discussion, that it
was uttered concerning Christ. Now the Laurentes already reigned in Italy, from whom the
origin of the Roman people is quite evidently derived after the Greeks; yet the kingdom of
Assyria still lasted, in which Lampares was the twenty-third king when Picus first began to
reign at Laurentum. The worshippers of such gods may see what they are to think of Saturn
the father of Picus, who deny that he was a man; of whom some also have written that he
himself reigned in Italy before Picus his son; and Virgil in his well-known book says,
<lg>
<l>“That race indocile, and through mountains high</l>
<l>Dispersed, he settled, and endowed with laws,</l>
<l>And named their country Latium, because</l>
<l>Latent within their coasts he dwelt secure.</l>
<l>Tradition says the golden ages pure</l>
<l>Began when he was king.”1140</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But they regard these as poetic fancies, and assert that the father of Picus was Sterces
rather, and relate that, being a most skillful husbandman, he discovered that the fields could
be fertilized by the dung of animals, which is called stercus from his name. Some say he was
called Stercutius. But for whatever reason they chose to call him Saturn, it is yet certain
they made this Sterces or Stercutius a god for his merit in agriculture; and they likewise received
into the number of these gods Picus his son, whom they affirm to have been a famous
augur and warrior. Picus begot Faunus, the second king of Laurentum; and he too is, or
was, a god with them. These divine honors they gave to dead men before the Trojan war.</p>

<p>Troy was overthrown, and its destruction was everywhere sung and made well known
even to boys; for it was signally published and spread abroad, both by its own greatness and
by writers of excellent style. And this was done in the reign of Latinus the son of Faunus,
from whom the kingdom began to be called Latium instead of Laurentum. The victorious
Greeks, on leaving Troy destroyed and returning to their own countries, were torn and
crushed by divers and horrible calamities. Yet even from among them they increased the
number of their gods for they made Diomede a god. They allege that his return home was
prevented by a divinely imposed punishment, and they prove, not by fabulous and poetic
falsehood, but by historic attestation, that his companions were turned into birds. Yet they
think that, even although he was made a god, he could neither restore them to the human
form by his own power, nor yet obtain it from Jupiter his king, as a favor granted to a new
inhabitant of heaven. They also say that his temple is in the island of Diomedæa, not far
from Mount Garganus in Apulia, and that these birds fly round about this temple, and
worship in it with such wonderful obedience, that they fill their beaks with water and sprinkle
it; and if Greeks, or those born of the Greek race, come there, they are not only still, but fly
to meet them; but if they are foreigners, they fly up at their heads, and wound them with
such severe strokes as even to kill them. For they are said to be well enough armed for these
combats with their hard and large beaks.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—What Varro Says of the Incredible Transformations of Men.</head>
<p>In support of this story, Varro relates others no less incredible about that most famous
sorceress Circe, who changed the companions of Ulysses into beasts, and about the Arcadians,
who, by lot, swam across a certain pool, and were turned into wolves there, and lived in the
deserts of that region with wild beasts like themselves. But if they never fed on human flesh
for nine years, they were restored to the human form on swimming back again through the
same pool. Finally, he expressly names one Demænetus, who, on tasting a boy offered up
in sacrifice by the Arcadians to their god Lycæus according to their custom, was changed
into a wolf, and, being restored to his proper form in the tenth year, trained himself as a
pugilist, and was victorious at the Olympic games. And the same historian thinks that the
epithet Lycæus was applied in Arcadia to Pan and Jupiter for no other reason than this
metamorphosis of men into wolves, because it was thought it could not be wrought except
by a divine power. For a wolf is called in Greek λυκὸς, from which the name Lycæus appears
to be formed. He says also that the Roman Luperci were as it were sprung of the seed of
these mysteries.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—What We Should Believe Concerning the Transformations Which
Seem to Happen to Men Through the Art of Demons.</head>
<p>Perhaps our readers expect us to say something about this so great delusion wrought
by the demons; and what shall we say but that men must fly out of the midst of Babylon?1141
For this prophetic precept is to be understood spiritually in this sense, that by going forward
in the living God, by the steps of faith, which worketh by love, we must flee out of the city
of this world, which is altogether a society of ungodly angels and men. Yea, the greater we
see the power of the demons to be in these depths, so much the more tenaciously must we
cleave to the Mediator through whom we ascend from these lowest to the highest places.
For if we should say these things are not to be credited, there are not wanting even now
some who would affirm that they had either heard on the best authority, or even themselves
experienced, something of that kind. Indeed we ourselves, when in Italy, heard such things
about a certain region there where landladies of inns, imbued with these wicked arts, were
said to be in the habit of giving to such travellers as they chose, or could manage, something
in a piece of cheese by which they were changed on the spot into beasts of burden, and carried
whatever was necessary, and were restored to their own form when the work was done. Yet
their mind did not become bestial, but remained rational and human, just as Apuleius, in
the books he wrote with the title of The Golden Ass, has told, or feigned, that it happened
to his own self that, on taking poison, he became an ass, while retaining his human mind.</p>
<p>These things are either false, or so extraordinary as to be with good reason disbelieved.
But it is to be most firmly believed that Almighty God can do whatever He pleases, whether
in punishing or favoring, and that the demons can accomplish nothing by their natural
power (for their created being is itself angelic, although made malign by their own fault),
except what He may permit, whose judgments are often hidden, but never unrighteous.
And indeed the demons, if they really do such things as these on which this discussion turns,
do not create real substances, but only change the appearance of things created by the true
God so as to make them seem to be what they are not. I cannot therefore believe that even
the body, much less the mind, can really be changed into bestial forms and lineaments by
any reason, art, or power of the demons; but the phantasm of a man which even in thought
or dreams goes through innumerable changes may, when the man’s senses are laid asleep
or overpowered, be presented to the senses of others in a corporeal form, in some indescribable
way unknown to me, so that men’s bodies themselves may lie somewhere, alive, indeed,
yet with their senses locked up much more heavily and firmly than by sleep, while that
phantasm, as it were embodied in the shape of some animal, may appear to the senses of
others, and may even seem to the man himself to be changed, just as he may seem to himself
in sleep to be so changed, and to bear burdens; and these burdens, if they are real substances,
<note type="footnote">1141 Isa. xlviii. 20.</note>

<pb n="848"/>
are borne by the demons, that men may be deceived by beholding at the same time the real
substance of the burdens and the simulated bodies of the beasts of burden. For a certain
man called Præstantius used to tell that it had happened to his father in his own house, that
he took that poison in a piece of cheese, and lay in his bed as if sleeping, yet could by no
means be aroused. But he said that after a few days he as it were woke up and related the
things he had suffered as if they had been dreams, namely, that he had been made a sumpter
horse, and, along with other beasts of burden, had carried provisions for the soldiers of what
is called the Rhoetian Legion, because it was sent to Rhoetia. And all this was found to have
taken place just as he told, yet it had seemed to him to be his own dream. And another man
declared that in his own house at night, before he slept, he saw a certain philosopher, whom
he knew very well, come to him and explain to him some things in the Platonic philosophy
which he had previously declined to explain when asked. And when he had asked this
philosopher why he did in his house what he had refused to do at home, he said, “I did not
do it, but I dreamed I had done it.” And thus what the one saw when sleeping was shown
to the other when awake by a phantasmal image.</p>
<p>These things have not come to us from persons we might deem unworthy of credit, but
from informants we could not suppose to be deceiving us. Therefore what men say and
have committed to writing about the Arcadians being often changed into wolves by the
Arcadian gods, or demons rather, and what is told in song about Circe transforming the
companions of Ulysses,1142 if they were really done, may, in my opinion, have been done
in the way I have said. As for Diomede’s birds, since their race is alleged to have been perpetuated
by constant propagation, I believe they were not made through the metamorphosis
of men, but were slyly substituted for them on their removal, just as the hind was for
Iphigenia, the daughter of king Agamemnon. For juggleries of this kind could not be difficult
for the demons if permitted by the judgment of God; and since that virgin was afterwards,
found alive it is easy to see that a hind had been slyly substituted for her. But because the
companions of Diomede were of a sudden nowhere to be seen, and afterwards could nowhere
be found, being destroyed by bad avenging angels, they were believed to have been changed
into those birds, which were secretly brought there from other places where such birds were,
and suddenly substituted for them by fraud. But that they bring water in their beaks and
sprinkle it on the temple of Diomede, and that they fawn on men of Greek race and persecute
aliens, is no wonderful thing to be done by the inward influence of the demons, whose interest
it is to persuade men that Diomede was made a god, and thus to beguile them into worshipping
many false gods, to the great dishonor of the true God; and to serve dead men, who
even in their lifetime did not truly live, with temples, altars, sacrifices, and priests, all which,
when of the right kind, are due only to the one living and true God.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—That Æneas Came into Italy When Abdon the Judge Ruled Over the
Hebrews.</head>
<p>After the capture and destruction of Troy, Æneas, with twenty ships laden with the
Trojan relics, came into Italy, when Latinus reigned there, Menestheus in Athens, Polyphidos
in Sicyon, and Tautanos in Assyria, and Abdon was judge of the Hebrews. On the death of
Latinus, Æneas reigned three years, the same kings continuing in the above-named places,
except that Pelasgus was now king in Sicyon, and Samson was judge of the Hebrews, who
is thought to be Hercules, because of his wonderful strength. Now the Latins made Æneas
one of their gods, because at his death he was nowhere to be found. The Sabines also placed
among the gods their first king, Sancus, [Sangus], or Sanctus, as some call him. At that time
Codrus king of Athens exposed himself incognito to be slain by the Peloponnesian foes of
that city, and so was slain. In this way, they say, he delivered his country. For the Peloponnesians
had received a response from the oracle, that they should overcome the
Athenians only on condition that they did not slay their king. Therefore he deceived them
by appearing in a poor man’s dress, and provoking them, by quarrelling, to murder him.
Whence Virgil says, “Or the quarrels of Codrus.”1143 And the Athenians worshipped this
man as a god with sacrificial honors. The fourth king of the Latins was Silvius the son of
Æneas, not by Creüsa, of whom Ascanius the third king was born, but by Lavinia the
daughter of Latinus, and he is said to have been his posthumous child. Oneus was the
twenty-ninth king of Assyria, Melanthus the sixteenth of the Athenians, and Eli the priest
was judge of the Hebrews; and the kingdom of Sicyon then came to an end, after lasting, it
is said, for nine hundred and fifty-nine years.</p>

<p>While these kings reigned in the places mentioned, the period of the judges being ended,
the kingdom of Israel next began with king Saul, when Samuel the prophet lived. At that
date those Latin kings began who were surnamed Silvii, having that surname, in addition
to their proper name, from their predecessor, that son of Æneas who was called Silvius; just
as, long afterward, the successors of Cæsar Augustus were surnamed Cæsars. Saul being
rejected, so that none of his issue should reign, on his death David succeeded him in the
kingdom, after he had reigned forty years. Then the Athenians ceased to have kings after
the death of Codrus, and began to have a magistracy to rule the republic. After David, who
also reigned forty years, his son Solomon was king of Israel, who built that most noble temple
of God at Jerusalem. In his time Alba was built among the Latins, from which thereafter
the kings began to be styled kings not of the Latins, but of the Albans, although in the same
Latium. Solomon was succeeded by his son Rehoboam, under whom that people was divided
into two kingdoms, and its separate parts began to have separate kings.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Of the Kings of Latium, the First and Twelfth of Whom, Æneas and
Aventinus, Were Made Gods.</head>
<p>After Æneas, whom they deified, Latium had eleven kings, none of whom was deified.
But Aventinus, who was the twelfth after Æneas, having been laid low in war, and buried
in that hill still called by his name, was added to the number of such gods as they made for
themselves. Some, indeed, were unwilling to write that he was slain in battle, but said he
was nowhere to be found, and that it was not from his name, but from the alighting of birds,
that hill was called Aventinus.1144 After this no god was made in Latium except Romulus
the founder of Rome. But two kings are found between these two, the first of whom I shall
describe in the Virgilian verse:
<lg>
<l>“Next came that Procas, glory of the Trojan race.”1145</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>That greatest of all kingdoms, the Assyrian, had its long duration brought to a close in
his time, the time of Rome’s birth drawing nigh. For the Assyrian empire was transferred
to the Medes after nearly thirteen hundred and five years, if we include the reign of Belus,
who begot Ninus, and, content with a small kingdom, was the first king there. Now Procas
reigned before Amulius. And Amulius had made his brother Numitor’s daughter, Rhea by
name, who was also called Ilia, a vestal virgin, who conceived twin sons by Mars, as they
will have it, in that way honoring or excusing her adultery, adding as a proof that a she-wolf
nursed the infants when exposed. For they think this kind of beast belongs to Mars so that
the she-wolf is believed to have given her teats to the infants, because she knew they were
the sons of Mars her lord; although there are not wanting persons who say that when the
crying babes lay exposed, they were first of all picked up by I know not what harlot, and
sucked her breasts first (now harlots were called lupæ, she-wolves, from which their vile
abodes are even yet called lupanaria), and that afterwards they came into the hands of the
shepherd Faustulus, and were nursed by Acca his wife. Yet what wonder is it, if, to rebuke
the king who had cruelly ordered them to be thrown into the water, God was pleased, after
divinely delivering them from the water, to succor, by means of a wild beast giving milk,
these infants by whom so great a city was to be founded? Amulius was succeeded in the
Latian kingdom by his brother Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus; and Rome was founded
in the first year of this Numitor, who from that time reigned along with his grandson Romulus.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—That Rome Was Founded When the Assyrian Kingdom Perished, at
Which Time Hezekiah Reigned in Judah.</head>
<p>To be brief, the city of Rome was founded, like another Babylon, and as it were the
daughter of the former Babylon, by which God was pleased to conquer the whole world,
and subdue it far and wide by bringing it into one fellowship of government and laws. For
there were already powerful and brave peoples and nations trained to arms, who did not
easily yield, and whose subjugation necessarily involved great danger and destruction as
well as great and horrible labor. For when the Assyrian kingdom subdued almost all Asia,
although this was done by fighting, yet the wars could not be very fierce or difficult, because
the nations were as yet untrained to resist, and neither so many nor so great as afterward;
forasmuch as, after that greatest and indeed universal flood, when only eight men escaped
in Noah’s ark, not much more than a thousand years had passed when Ninus subdued all
Asia with the exception of India. But Rome did not with the same quickness and facility
wholly subdue all those nations of the east and west which we see brought under the Roman
empire, because, in its gradual increase, in whatever direction it was extended, it found them
strong and warlike. At the time when Rome was founded, then, the people of Israel had
been in the land of promise seven hundred and eighteen years. Of these years twenty-seven
belong to Joshua the son of Nun, and after that three hundred and twenty-nine to the period
of the judges. But from the time when the kings began to reign there, three hundred and
sixty-two years had passed. And at that time there was a king in Judah called Ahaz, or, as
others compute, Hezekiah his successor, the best and most pious king, who it is admitted
reigned in the times of Romulus. And in that part of the Hebrew nation called Israel, Hoshea
had begun to reign.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Of the Erythræan Sibyl, Who is Known to Have Sung Many Things
About Christ More Plainly Than the Other Sibyls.1146</head>
<p>Some say the Erythræan sibyl prophesied at this time. Now Varro declares there were
many sibyls, and not merely one. This sibyl of Erythræ certainly wrote some things concerning
Christ which are quite manifest, and we first read them in the Latin tongue in verses of
bad Latin, and unrhythmical, through the unskillfulness, as we afterwards learned, of some
interpreter unknown to me. For Flaccianus, a very famous man, who was also a proconsul,
a man of most ready eloquence and much learning, when we were speaking about Christ,
produced a Greek manuscript, saying that it was the prophecies of the Erythræan sibyl, in
which he pointed out a certain passage which had the initial letters of the lines so arranged
that these words could be read in them: ᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστος Θεοῦ υιὸς σωτηρ, which means,
“Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour.” And these verses, of which the initial letters
yield that meaning, contain what follows as translated by some one into Latin in good
rhythm:
<lg>
<l>Ι Judgment shall moisten the earth with the sweat of its standard,</l>
<l>Η Ever enduring, behold the King shall come through the ages,</l>
<l>Σ Sent to be here in the flesh, and Judge at the last of the world.</l>

<p>In these Latin verses the meaning of the Greek is correctly given, although not in the
exact order of the lines as connected with the initial letters; for in three of them, the fifth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth, where the Greek letter Υ occurs, Latin words could not be found
beginning with the corresponding letter, and yielding a suitable meaning. So that, if we
note down together the initial letters of all the lines in our Latin translation except those
three in which we retain the letter Υ in the proper place, they will express in five Greek words
this meaning, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour.” And the verses are twenty-seven,
which is the cube of three. For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if tripled, so as to
rise from the superficial square to the cube, comes to twenty-seven. But if you join the initial
letters of these five Greek words, ᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστος Θεοῦ υἰὸς σωτήρ, which mean, “Jesus
Christ the Son of God, the Saviour,” they will make the word ἰχδὺς, that is, “fish,” in which
word Christ is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is, to exist, without
sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters.1147</p>
<p>But this sibyl, whether she is the Erythræan, or, as some rather believe, the Cumæan,
in her whole poem, of which this is a very small portion, not only has nothing that can relate
to the worship of the false or feigned gods, but rather speaks against them and their worshippers
in such a way that we might even think she ought to be reckoned among those who
belong to the city of God. Lactantius also inserted in his work the prophecies about Christ
of a certain sibyl, he does not say which. But I have thought fit to combine in a single extract,
which may seem long, what he has set down in many short quotations. She says, “Afterward
He shall come into the injurious hands of the unbelieving, and they will give God buffets
with profane hands, and with impure mouth will spit out envenomed spittle; but He will

with simplicity yield His holy back to stripes. And He will hold His peace when struck with
the fist, that no one may find out what word, or whence, He comes to speak to hell; and He
shall be crowned with a crown of thorns. And they gave Him gall for meat, and vinegar for
His thirst: they will spread this table of inhospitality. For thou thyself, being foolish, hast
not understood thy God, deluding the minds of mortals, but hast both crowned Him with
thorns and mingled for Him bitter gall. But the veil of the temple shall be rent; and at
midday it shall be darker than night for three hours. And He shall die the death, taking
sleep for three days; and then returning from hell, He first shall come to the light, the beginning
of the resurrection being shown to the recalled.” Lactantius made use of these sibylline
testimonies, introducing them bit by bit in the course of his discussion as the things he intended
to prove seemed to require, and we have set them down in one connected series,
uninterrupted by comment, only taking care to mark them by capitals, if only the transcribers
do not neglect to preserve them hereafter. Some writers, indeed, say that the Erythræan
sibyl was not in the time of Romulus, but of the Trojan war.</p>

<p>While Romulus reigned, Thales the Milesian is said to have lived, being one of the seven
sages, who succeeded the theological poets, of whom Orpheus was the most renowned, and
were called Σοφοί, that is, sages. During that time the ten tribes, which on the division of
the people were called Israel, were conquered by the Chaldeans and led captive into their
lands, while the two tribes which were called Judah, and had the seat of their kingdom in
Jerusalem, remained in the land of Judea. As Romulus, when dead, could nowhere be found,
the Romans, as is everywhere notorious, placed him among the gods,—a thing which by
that time had already ceased to be done, and which was not done afterwards till the time of
the Cæsars, and then not through error, but in flattery; so that Cicero ascribes great praises
to Romulus, because he merited such honors not in rude and unlearned times, when men
were easily deceived, but in times already polished and learned, although the subtle and
acute loquacity of the philosophers had not yet culminated. But although the later times
did not deify dead men, still they did not cease to hold and worship as gods those deified of
old; nay, by images, which the ancients never had, they even increased the allurements of
vain and impious superstition, the unclean demons effecting this in their heart, and also
deceiving them by lying oracles, so that even the fabulous crimes of the gods, which were
not once imagined by a more polite age, were yet basely acted in the plays in honor of these
same false deities. Numa reigned after Romulus; and although he had thought that Rome
would be better defended the more gods there were, yet on his death he himself was not
counted worthy of a place among them, as if it were supposed that he had so crowded
heaven that a place could not be found for him there. They report that the Samian sibyl
lived while he reigned at Rome, and when Manasseh began to reign over the Hebrews,—an
impious king, by whom the prophet Isaiah is said to have been slain.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—What Philosophers Were Famous When Tarquinius Priscus Reigned
Over the Romans, and Zedekiah Over the Hebrews, When Jerusalem Was Taken
and the Temple Overthrown.</head>
<p>When Zedekiah reigned over the Hebrews, and Tarquinius Priscus, the successor of
Ancus Martius, over the Romans, the Jewish people was led captive into Babylon, Jerusalem
and the temple built by Solomon being overthrown. For the prophets, in chiding them for
their iniquity and impiety, predicted that these things should come to pass, especially
Jeremiah, who even stated the number of years. Pittacus of Mitylene, another of the sages,
is reported to have lived at that time. And Eusebius writes that, while the people of God
were held captive in Babylon, the five other sages lived, who must be added to Thales, whom
we mentioned above, and Pittacus, in order to make up the seven. These are Solon of Athens,
Chilo of Lacedæmon, Periander of Corinth, Cleobulus of Lindus, and Bias of Priene. These
flourished after the theological poets, and were called sages, because they excelled other
men in a certain laudable line of life, and summed up some moral precepts in epigrammatic
sayings. But they left posterity no literary monuments, except that Solon is alleged to have
given certain laws to the Athenians, and Thales was a natural philosopher, and left books
of his doctrine in short proverbs. In that time of the Jewish captivity, Anaximander,
Anaximenes, and Xenophanes, the natural philosophers, flourished. Pythagoras also lived
then, and at this time the name philosopher was first used.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—That at the Time When the Captivity of the Jews Was Brought to an
End, on the Completion of Seventy Years, the Romans Also Were Freed from
Kingly Rule.</head>
<p>At this time, Cyrus king of Persia, who also ruled the Chaldeans and Assyrians, having
somewhat relaxed the captivity of the Jews, made fifty thousand of them return in order to
rebuild the temple. They only began the first foundations and built the altar; but, owing to
hostile invasions, they were unable to go on, and the work was put off to the time of Darius.
During the same time also those things were done which are written in the book of Judith,
which, indeed, the Jews are said not to have received into the canon of the Scriptures. Under
Darius king of Persia, then, on the completion of the seventy years predicted by Jeremiah
the prophet, the captivity of the Jews was brought to an end, and they were restored to
liberty. Tarquin then reigned as the seventh king of the Romans. On his expulsion, they
also began to be free from the rule of their kings. Down to this time the people of Israel had
prophets; but, although they were numerous, the canonical writings of only a few of them
have been preserved among the Jews and among us. In closing the previous book, I promised
to set down something in this one about them, and I shall now do so.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Of the Times of the Prophets Whose Oracles are Contained in Books
and Who Sang Many Things About the Call of the Gentiles at the Time When
the Roman Kingdom Began and the Assyrian Came to an End.</head>
<p>In order that we may be able to consider these times, let us go back a little to earlier
times. At the beginning of the book of the prophet Hosea, who is placed first of twelve, it
is written, “The word of the Lord which came to Hosea in the days of Uzziah, Jothan, Ahaz,
and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.”1148 Amos also writes that he prophesied in the days of
Uzziah, and adds the name of Jeroboam king of Israel, who lived at the same time.1149
Isaiah the son of Amos—either the above-named prophet, or, as is rather affirmed, another
who was not a prophet, but was called by the same name—also puts at the head of his book
these four kings named by Hosea, saying by way of preface that he prophesied in their
days.1150 Micah also names the same times as those of his prophecy, after the days of
Uzziah;1151 for he names the same three kings as Hosea named,—Jotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah. We find from their own writings that these men prophesied contemporaneously.
To these are added Jonah in the reign of Uzziah, and Joel in that of Jotham, who succeeded
Uzziah. But we can find the date of these two prophets in the chronicles,1152 not in their
own writings, for they say nothing about it themselves. Now these days extend from Procas
king of the Latins, or his predecessor Aventinus, down to Romulus king of the Romans, or
even to the beginning of the reign of his successor Numa Pompilius. Hezekiah king of Judah
certainly reigned till then. So that thus these fountains of prophecy, as I may call them,
burst forth at once during those times when the Assyrian kingdom failed and the Roman
began; so that, just as in the first period of the Assyrian kingdom Abraham arose, to whom
the most distinct promises were made that all nations should be blessed in his seed, so at
the beginning of the western Babylon, in the time of whose government Christ was to come
in whom these promises were to be fulfilled, the oracles of the prophets were given not only
in spoken but in written words, for a testimony that so great a thing should come to pass.
For although the people of Israel hardly ever lacked prophets from the time when they began
to have kings, these were only for their own use, not for that of the nations. But when the
more manifestly prophetic Scripture began to be formed, which was to benefit the nations
too, it was fitting that it should begin when this city was founded which was to rule the nations.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Of the Things Pertaining to the Gospel of Christ Which Hosea and
Amos Prohesied.</head>
<p>The prophet Hosea speaks so very profoundly that it is laborious work to penetrate his
meaning. But, according to promise, we must insert something from his book. He says,
“And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my
people, there they shall be called the sons of the living God.”1153 Even the apostles understood
this as a prophetic testimony of the calling of the nations who did not formerly belong
to God; and because this same people of the Gentiles is itself spiritually among the children
of Abraham, and for that reason is rightly called Israel, therefore he goes on to say, “And
the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together in one, and shall
appoint themselves one headship, and shall ascend from the earth.”1154 We should but
weaken the savor of this prophetic oracle if we set ourselves to expound it. Let the reader
but call to mind that cornerstone and those two walls of partition, the one of the Jews, the
other of the Gentiles,1155 and he will recognize them, the one under the term sons of Judah,
the other as sons of Israel, supporting themselves by one and the same headship, and ascending
from the earth. But that those carnal Israelites who are now unwilling to believe in
Christ shall afterward believe, that is, their children shall (for they themselves, of course,
shall go to their own place by dying), this same prophet testifies, saying, “For the children
of Israel shall abide many days without a king, without a prince, without a sacrifice, without
an altar, without a priesthood, without manifestations.”1156 Who does not see that the Jews
are now thus? But let us hear what he adds: “And afterward shall the children of Israel return,
and seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and shall be amazed at the Lord and at
His goodness in the latter days.”1157 Nothing is clearer than this prophecy, in which by
David, as distinguished by the title of king, Christ is to be understood, “who is made,” as
the apostle says, “of the seed of David according to the flesh.”1158 This prophet has also
foretold the resurrection of Christ on the third day, as it behoved to be foretold, with
prophetic loftiness, when he says, “He will heal us after two days, and in the third day we
shall rise again.”1159 In agreement with this the apostle says to us, “If ye be risen with Christ,
seek those things which are above.”1160 Amos also prophesies thus concerning such things:

“Prepare thee, that thou mayst invoke thy God, O Israel; for lo, I am binding the thunder,
and creating the spirit, and announcing to men their Christ.”1161 And in another place he
says, “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and build up the
breaches thereof: and I will raise up his ruins, and will build them up again as in the days
of old: that the residue of men may inquire for me, and all the nations upon whom my
name is invoked, saith the Lord that doeth this.”1162</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—What Things are Predicted by Isaiah Concerning Christ and the
Church.</head>
<p>The prophecy of Isaiah is not in the book of the twelve prophets, who are called the
minor from the brevity of their writings, as compared with those who are called the greater
prophets because they published larger volumes. Isaiah belongs to the latter, yet I connect
him with the two above named, because he prophesied at the same time. Isaiah, then, together
with his rebukes of wickedness, precepts of righteousness, and predictions of evil,
also prophesied much more than the rest about Christ and the Church, that is, about the
King and that city which he founded; so that some say he should be called an evangelist
rather than a prophet. But, in order to finish this work, I quote only one out of many in
this place. Speaking in the person of the Father, he says, “Behold, my servant shall understand,
and shall be exalted and glorified very much. As many shall be astonished at Thee.”1163
This is about Christ.</p>
<p>But let us now hear what follows about the Church. He says, “Rejoice, O barren, thou
that barest not; break forth and cry, thou that didst not travail with child: for many more
are the children of the desolate than of her that has an husband.”1164 But these must suffice;
and some things in them ought to be expounded; yet I think those parts sufficient which
are so plain that even enemies must be compelled against their will to understand them.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—What Micah, Jonah, and Joel Prophesied in Accordance with the New
Testament.</head>
<p>The prophet Micah, representing Christ under the figure of a great mountain, speaks
thus: “It shall come to pass in the last days, that the manifested mountain of the Lord shall
be prepared on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people
shall hasten unto it. Many nations shall go, and shall say, Come, let us go up into the
mountain of the Lord, and into the house of the God of Jacob; and He will show us His way,
and we will go in His paths: for out of Zion shall proceed the law, and the word of the Lord
out of Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar
off.”1165 This prophet predicts the very place in which Christ was born, saying, “And thou,
Bethlehem, of the house of Ephratah, art the least that can be reckoned among the thousands
of Judah; out of thee shall come forth unto me a leader, to be the prince in Israel; and His
going forth is from the beginning, even from the days of eternity. Therefore will He give
them [up] even until the time when she that travaileth shall bring forth; and the remnant
of His brethren shall be converted to the sons of Israel. And He shall stand, and see, and
feed His flock in the strength of the Lord, and in the dignity of the name of the Lord His
God: for now shall He be magnified even to the utmost of the earth.”1166</p>
<p>The prophet Jonah, not so much by speech as by his own painful experience, prophesied
Christ’s death and resurrection much more clearly than if he had proclaimed them with his
voice. For why was he taken into the whale’s belly and restored on the third day, but that
he might be a sign that Christ should return from the depths of hell on the third day?</p>
<p>I should be obliged to use many words in explaining all that Joel prophesies in order to
make clear those that pertain to Christ and the Church. But there is one passage I must not
pass by, which the apostles also quoted when the Holy Spirit came down from above on the
assembled believers according to Christ’s promise. He says, “And it shall come to pass after
these things, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream, and your young men shall see visions: and
even on my servants and mine handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.”1167</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Of the Predictions Concerning the Salvation of the World in Christ,
in Obadiah, Nahum, and Habakkuk.</head>
<p>The date of three of the minor prophets, Obadiah, Nahum, and Habakkuk, is neither
mentioned by themselves nor given in the chronicles of Eusebius and Jerome. For although
they put Obadiah with Micah, yet when Micah prophesied does not appear from that part
of their writings in which the dates are noted. And this, I think, has happened through their
error in negligently copying the works of others. But we could not find the two others now
mentioned in the copies of the chronicles which we have; yet because they are contained in
the canon, we ought not to pass them by.</p>
<p>Obadiah, so far as his writings are concerned, the briefest of all the prophets, speaks
against Idumea, that is, the nation of Esau, that reprobate elder of the twin sons of Isaac and
grandsons of Abraham. Now if, by that form of speech in which a part is put for the whole,
we take Idumea as put for the nations, we may understand of Christ what he says among
other things, “But upon Mount Sion shall be safety, and there shall be a Holy One.”1168
And a little after, at the end of the same prophecy, he says, “And those who are saved again
shall come up out of Mount Sion, that they may defend Mount Esau, and it shall be a kingdom
to the Lord.”1169 It is quite evident this was fulfilled when those saved again out of Mount
Sion—that is, the believers in Christ from Judea, of whom the apostles are chiefly to be acknowledged—
went up to defend Mount Esau. How could they defend it except by making
safe, through the preaching of the gospel, those who believed that they might be “delivered
from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God?”1170 This he expressed
as an inference, adding, “And it shall be to the Lord a kingdom.” For Mount Sion signifies
Judea, where it is predicted there shall be safety, and a Holy One, that is, Christ Jesus. But
Mount Esau is Idumea, which signifies the Church of the Gentiles, which, as I have expounded,
those saved again out of Sion have defended that it should be a kingdom to the
Lord. This was obscure before it took place; but what believer does not find it out now that
it is done?</p>
<p>As for the prophet Nahum, through him God says, “I will exterminate the graven and
the molten things: I will make thy burial. For lo, the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings
and announceth peace are swift upon the mountains! O Judah, celebrate thy festival days,
and perform thy vows; for now they shall not go on any more so as to become antiquated.
It is completed, it is consumed, it is taken away. He ascendeth who breathes in thy face,
delivering thee out of tribulation.”1171 Let him that remembers the gospel call to mind who

hath ascended from hell and breathed the Holy Spirit in the face of Judah, that is, of the
Jewish disciples; for they belong to the New Testament, whose festival days are so spiritually
renewed that they cannot become antiquated. Moreover, we already see the graven and
molten things, that is, the idols of the false gods, exterminated through the gospel, and given
up to oblivion as of the grave, and we know that this prophecy is fulfilled in this very thing.</p>
<p>Of what else than the advent of Christ, who was to come, is Habakkuk understood to
say, “And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision openly on a tablet of boxwood,
that he that readeth these things may understand. For the vision is yet for a time appointed,
and it will arise in the end, and will not become void: if it tarry, wait for it; because it will
surely come, and will not be delayed?”1172</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—Of the Prophecy that is Contained in the Prayer and Song of Habakkuk.</head>
<p>In his prayer, with a song, to whom but the Lord Christ does he say, “O Lord, I have
heard Thy hearing, and was afraid: O Lord, I have considered Thy works, and was greatly
afraid?”1173 What is this but the inexpressible admiration of the foreknown, new, and
sudden salvation of men? “In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be recognized.”
What is this but either between the two testaments, or between the two thieves, or between
Moses and Elias talking with Him on the mount? “While the years draw nigh, Thou wilt
be recognized; at the coming of the time Thou wilt be shown,” does not even need exposition.
“While my soul shall be troubled at Him, in wrath Thou wilt be mindful of mercy.” What
is this but that He puts Himself for the Jews, of whose nation He was, who were troubled
with great anger and crucified Christ, when He, mindful of mercy, said, “Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do?1174 “God shall come from Teman, and the Holy
One from the shady and close mountain.”1175 What is said here, “He shall come from
Teman,” some interpret “from the south,” or “from the southwest,” by which is signified
the noonday, that is, the fervor of charity and the splendor of truth. “The shady and close
mountain” might be understood in many ways, yet I prefer to take it as meaning the depth
of the divine Scriptures, in which Christ is prophesied: for in the Scriptures there are many
things shady and close which exercise the mind of the reader; and Christ comes thence when
he who has understanding finds Him there. “His power covereth up the heavens, and the
earth is full of His praise.” What is this but what is also said in the psalm, “Be Thou exalted,
O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory above all the earth?”1176 “His splendor shall be
as the light.” What is it but that the fame of Him shall illuminate believers? “Horns are in
His hands.” What is this but the trophy of the cross? “And He hath placed the firm charity
of His strength”1177 needs no exposition. “Before His face shall go the word, and it shall go
forth into the field after His feet.” What is this but that He should both be announced before
His coming hither and after His return hence? “He stood, and the earth was moved.” What
is this but that “He stood” for succor, “and the earth was moved” to believe? “He regarded,
and the nations melted;” that is, He had compassion, and made the people penitent. “The
mountains are broken with violence;” that is, through the power of those who work miracles
the pride of the haughty is broken. “The everlasting hills flowed down;” that is, they are
humbled in time that they may be lifted up for eternity. “I saw His goings [made] eternal
for his labors;” that is, I beheld His labor of love not left without the reward of eternity.

“The tents of Ethiopia shall be greatly afraid, and the tents of the land of Midian;” that is,
even those nations which are not under the Roman authority, being suddenly terrified by
the news of Thy wonderful works, shall become a Christian people. “Wert Thou angry at
the rivers, O Lord? or was Thy fury against the rivers? or was Thy rage against the sea?”
This is said because He does not now come to condemn the world, but that the world through
Him might be saved.1178 “For Thou shall mount upon Thy horses, and Thy riding shall be
salvation;” that is, Thine evangelists shall carry Thee, for they are guided by Thee, and Thy
gospel is salvation to them that believe in Thee. “Bending, Thou wilt bend Thy bow against
the sceptres, saith the Lord;” that is, Thou wilt threaten even the kings of the earth with Thy
judgment. “The earth shall be cleft with rivers;” that is, by the sermons of those who preach
Thee flowing in upon them, men’s hearts shall be opened to make confession, to whom it
is said, “Rend your hearts and not your garments.”1179 What does “The people shall see
Thee and grieve” mean, but that in mourning they shall be blessed?1180 What is “Scattering
the waters in marching,” but that by walking in those who everywhere proclaim Thee, Thou
wilt scatter hither and thither the streams of Thy doctrine? What is “The abyss uttered its
voice?” Is it not that the depth of the human heart expressed what it perceived? The words,
“The depth of its phantasy,” are an explanation of the previous verse, for the depth is the
abyss; and “Uttered its voice” is to be understood before them, that is, as we have said, it
expressed what it perceived. Now the phantasy is the vision, which it did not hold or conceal,
but poured forth in confession. “The sun was raised up, and the moon stood still in her
course;” that is, Christ ascended into heaven, and the Church was established under her
King. “Thy darts shall go in the light;” that is, Thy words shall not be sent in secret, but
openly. For He had said to His own disciples, “What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye
in the light.”1181 “By threatening thou shall diminish the earth;” that is, by that threatening
Thou shall humble men. “And in fury Thou shall cast down the nations;” for in punishing
those who exalt themselves Thou dashest them one against another. “Thou wentest forth
for the salvation of Thy people, that Thou mightest save Thy Christ; Thou hast sent death
on the heads of the wicked.” None of these words require exposition. “Thou hast lifted up
the bonds, even to the neck.” This may be understood even of the good bonds of wisdom,
that the feet may be put into its fetters, and the neck into its collar. “Thou hast struck off

in amazement of mind the bonds” must be understood for, He lifts up the good and strikes
off the bad, about which it is said to Him, “Thou hast broken asunder my bonds,”1182 and
that “in amazement of mind,” that is, wonderfully. “The heads of the mighty shall be moved
in it;” to wit, in that wonder. “They shall open their teeth like a poor man eating secretly.”
For some of the mighty among the Jews shall come to the Lord, admiring His works and
words, and shall greedily eat the bread of His doctrine in secret for fear of the Jews, just as
the Gospel has shown they did. “And Thou hast sent into the sea Thy horses, troubling
many waters,” which are nothing else than many people; for unless all were troubled, some
would not be converted with fear, others pursued with fury. “I gave heed, and my belly
trembled at the voice of the prayer of my lips; and trembling entered into my bones, and
my habit of body was troubled under me.” He gave heed to those things which he said, and
was himself terrified at his own prayer, which he had poured forth prophetically, and in
which he discerned things to come. For when many people are troubled, he saw the
threatening tribulation of the Church, and at once acknowledged himself a member of it,
and said, “I shall rest in the day of tribulation,” as being one of those who are rejoicing in
hope, patient in tribulation.1183 “That I may ascend,” he says, “among the people of my
pilgrimage,” departing quite from the wicked people of his carnal kinship, who are not pilgrims
in this earth, and do not seek the country above.1184 “Although the fig-tree,” he says,
“shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall lie, and the
fields shall yield no meat; the sheep shall be cut off from the meat, and there shall be no
oxen in the stalls.” He sees that nation which was to slay Christ about to lose the abundance
of spiritual supplies, which, in prophetic fashion, he has set forth by the figure of earthly
plenty. And because that nation was to suffer such wrath of God, because, being ignorant
of the righteousness of God, it wished to establish its own,1185 he immediately says, “Yet
will I rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in God my salvation. The Lord God is my strength, and
He will set my feet in completion; He will place me above the heights, that I may conquer
in His song,” to wit, in that song of which something similar is said in the psalm, “He set
my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings, and put in my mouth a new song, a hymn to
our God.”1186 He therefore conquers in the song of the Lord, who takes pleasure in His
praise, not in his own; that “He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”1187 But some
copies have, “I will joy in God my Jesus,” which seems to me better than the version of those

<head>Chapter 33.—What Jeremiah and Zephaniah Have, by the Prophetic Spirit, Spoken
Before Concerning Christ and the Calling of the Nations.</head>
<p>Jeremiah, like Isaiah, is one of the greater prophets, not of the minor, like the others
from whose writings I have just given extracts. He prophesied when Josiah reigned in Jerusalem,
and Ancus Martius at Rome, when the captivity of the Jews was already at hand; and
he continued to prophesy down to the fifth month of the captivity, as we find from his
writings. Zephaniah, one of the minor prophets, is put along with him, because he himself
says that he prophesied in the days of Josiah; but he does not say till when. Jeremiah thus
prophesied not only in the times of Ancus Martius, but also in those of Tarquinius Priscus,
whom the Romans had for their fifth king. For he had already begun to reign when that
captivity took place. Jeremiah, in prophesying of Christ, says, “The breath of our mouth,
the Lord Christ, was taken in our sins,”1188 thus briefly showing both that Christ is our Lord
and that He suffered for us. Also in another place he says, “This is my God, and there shall
none other be accounted of in comparison of Him; who hath found out all the way of
prudence, and hath given it to Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved: afterwards He
was seen on the earth, and conversed with men.”1189 Some attribute this testimony not to
Jeremiah, but to his secretary, who was called Baruch; but it is more commonly ascribed to
Jeremiah. Again the same prophet says concerning Him, “Behold the days come, saith the
Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous shoot, and a King shall reign and shall be
wise, and shall do judgment and justice in the earth. In those days Judah shall be saved, and
Israel shall dwell confidently: and this is the name which they shall call Him, Our righteous
Lord.”1190 And of the calling of the nations which was to come to pass, and which we now
see fulfilled, he thus spoke: “O Lord my God, and my refuge in the day of evils, to Thee
shall the nations come from the utmost end of the earth, saying, Truly our fathers have
worshipped lying images, wherein there is no profit.”1191 But that the Jews, by whom He
behoved even to be slain, were not going to acknowledge Him, this prophet thus intimates:
“Heavy is the heart through all; and He is a man, and who shall know Him?”1192 That
passage also is his which I have quoted in the seventeenth book concerning the new testament,
of which Christ is the Mediator. For Jeremiah himself says, “Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will complete over the house of Jacob a new testament,” and the rest, which
may be read there.1193</p>

<p>For the present I shall put down those predictions about Christ by the prophet Zephaniah,
who prophesied with Jeremiah. “Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection,
in the future; because it is my determination to assemble the nations, and gather
together the kingdoms.”1194 And again he says, “The Lord will be terrible upon them, and
will exterminate all the gods of the earth; and they shall worship Him every man from his
place, even all the isles of the nations.”1195 And a little after he says, “Then will I turn to
the people a tongue, and to His offspring, that they may call upon the name of the Lord,
and serve Him under one yoke. From the borders of the rivers of Ethiopia shall they bring
sacrifices unto me. In that day thou shall not be confounded for all thy curious inventions,
which thou hast done impiously against me: for then I will take away from thee the
haughtiness of thy trespass; and thou shalt no more magnify thyself above thy holy mountain.
And I will leave in thee a meek and humble people, and they who shall be left of Israel shall
fear the name of the Lord.”1196 These are the remnant of whom the apostle quotes that
which is elsewhere prophesied: “Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand
of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.”1197 These are the remnant of that nation who have
believed in Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—Of the Prophecy of Daniel and Ezekiel, Other Two of the Greater
Prophets.</head>
<p>Daniel and Ezekiel, other two of the greater prophets, also first prophesied in the very
captivity of Babylon. Daniel even defined the time when Christ was to come and suffer by
the exact date. It would take too long to show this by computation, and it has been done
often by others before us. But of His power and glory he has thus spoken: “I saw in a night
vision, and, behold, one like the Son of man was coming with the clouds of heaven, and He
came even to the Ancient of days, and He was brought into His presence. And to Him there
was given dominion, and honor, and a kingdom: and all people, tribes, and tongues shall
serve Him. His power is an everlasting power, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom
shall not be destroyed.”1198</p>
<p>Ezekiel also, speaking prophetically in the person of God the Father, thus foretells Christ,
speaking of Him in the prophetic manner as David, because He assumed flesh of the seed
of David, and on account of that form of a servant in which He was made man, He who is
the Son of God is also called the servant of God. He says, “And I will set up over my sheep
one Shepherd, who will feed them, even my servant David; and He shall feed them, and He
shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a prince
in the midst of them. I the Lord have spoken.”1199 And in another place he says, “And one
King shall be over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be
divided any more into two kingdoms: neither shall they defile themselves any more with
their idols, and their abominations, and all their iniquities. And I will save them out of all
their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my
people, and I will be their God. And my servant David shall be king over them, and there
shall be one Shepherd for them all.”1200</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—Of the Prophecy of the Three Prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and
Malachi.</head>
<p>There remain three minor prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who prophesied
at the close of the captivity. Of these Haggai more openly prophesies of Christ and the
Church thus briefly: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet one little while, and I will shake the
heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will move all nations, and the
desired of all nations shall come.”1201 The fulfillment of this prophecy is in part already
seen, and in part hoped for in the end. For He moved the heaven by the testimony of the
angels and the stars, when Christ became incarnate. He moved the earth by the great miracle
of His birth of the virgin. He moved the sea and the dry land, when Christ was proclaimed
both in the isles and in the whole world. So we see all nations moved to the faith; and the
fulfillment of what follows, “And the desired of all nations shall come,” is looked for at His
last coming. For ere men can desire and and wait for Him, they must believe and love Him.</p>
<p>Zechariah says of Christ and the Church, “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; shout
joyfully, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King shall come unto thee, just and the Saviour;
Himself poor, and mounting an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass: and His dominion shall
be from sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.”1202 How this was done,
when the Lord Christ on His journey used a beast of burden of this kind, we read in the
Gospel, where, also, as much of this prophecy is quoted as appears sufficient for the context.
In another place, speaking in the Spirit of prophecy to Christ Himself of the remission of
sins through His blood, he says, “Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament, hast sent forth
Thy prisoners from the lake wherein is no water.”1203 Different opinions may be held,
consistently with right belief, as to what he meant by this lake. Yet it seems to me that no
meaning suits better than that of the depth of human misery, which is, as it were, dry and
barren, where there are no streams of righteousness, but only the mire of iniquity. For it is
said of it in the Psalms, “And He led me forth out of the lake of misery, and from the miry
clay.”1204</p>
<p>Malachi, foretelling the Church which we now behold propagated through Christ, says
most openly to the Jews, in the person of God, “I have no pleasure in you, and I will not
accept a gift at your hand. For from the rising even to the going down of the sun, my name
is great among the nations; and in every place sacrifice shall be made, and a pure oblation
shall be offered unto my name: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith the

Lord.”1205 Since we can already see this sacrifice offered to God in every place, from the
rising of the sun to his going down, through Christ’s priesthood after the order of
Melchisedec, while the Jews, to whom it was said, “I have no pleasure in you, neither will I
accept a gift at your hand,” cannot deny that their sacrifice has ceased, why do they still look
for another Christ, when they read this in the prophecy, and see it fulfilled, which could not
be fulfilled except through Him? And a little after he says of Him, in the person of God,
“My covenant was with Him of life and peace: and I gave to Him that He might fear me
with fear, and be afraid before my name. The law of truth was in His mouth: directing in
peace He hath walked with me, and hath turned many away from iniquity. For the Priest’s
lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at His mouth: for He is the Angel of
the Lord Almighty.”1206 Nor is it to be wondered at that Christ Jesus is called the Angel of
the Almighty God. For just as He is called a servant on account of the form of a servant in
which He came to men, so He is called an angel on account of the evangel which He proclaimed
to men. For if we interpret these Greek words, evangel is “good news,” and angel
is “messenger.” Again he says of Him, “Behold I will send mine angel, and He will look out
the way before my face: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into His temple,
even the Angel of the testament, whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord
Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?”1207
In this place he has foretold both the first and second advent of Christ: the first, to wit, of
which he says, “And He shall come suddenly into His temple;” that is, into His flesh, of
which He said in the Gospel, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up
again.”1208 And of the second advent he says, “Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty,
and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?” But what
he says, “The Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye desire,” just
means that even the Jews, according to the Scriptures which they read, shall seek and desire
Christ. But many of them did not acknowledge that He whom they sought and desired had
come, being blinded in their hearts, which were preoccupied with their own merits. Now
what he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, “My testament had been with
Him,” or here, where he has called Him the Angel of the testament, we ought, beyond a
doubt, to take to be the new testament, in which the things promised are eternal, and not
the old, in which they are only temporal. Yet many who are weak are troubled when they
see the wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value them greatly, and serve
the true God to be rewarded with them. On this account, to distinguish the eternal

blessedness of the new testament, which shall be given only to the good, from the earthly
felicity of the old, which for the most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet says,
“Ye have made your words burdensome to me: yet ye have said, In what have we spoken
ill of Thee? Ye have said, Foolish is every one who serves God; and what profit is it that we
have kept His observances, and that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord
Almighty? And now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things are built up
again; yea, they are opposed to God and are saved. They that feared the Lord uttered these
reproaches every one to his neighbor: and the Lord hearkened and heard; and He wrote a
book of remembrance before Him, for them that fear the Lord and that revere His name.”1209
By that book is meant the New Testament. Finally, let us hear what follows: “And they
shall be an acquisition for me, saith the Lord Almighty, in the day which I make; and I will
choose them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him. And ye shall return, and shall
discern between the just and the unjust, and between him that serveth God and him that
serveth Him not. For, behold, the day cometh burning as an oven, and it shall burn them
up; and all the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that shall come
will set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall leave neither root nor branch. And
unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in His
wings; and ye shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose from bonds. And ye shall tread
down the wicked, and they shall be ashes under your feet, in the day in which I shall do
[this], saith the Lord Almighty.”1210 This day is the day of judgment, of which, if God will,
we shall speak more fully in its own place.</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—About Esdras and the Books of the Maccabees.</head>
<p>After these three prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, during the same period of
the liberation of the people from the Babylonian servitude Esdras also wrote, who is historical
rather than prophetical, as is also the book called Esther, which is found to relate, for
the praise of God, events not far from those times; unless, perhaps, Esdras is to be understood
as prophesying of Christ in that passage where, on a question having arisen among certain
young men as to what is the strongest thing, when one had said kings, another wine, the
third women, who for the most part rule kings, yet that same third youth demonstrated that
the truth is victorious over all.1211 For by consulting the Gospel we learn that Christ is the
Truth. From this time, when the temple was rebuilt, down to the time of Aristobulus, the
Jews had not kings but princes; and the reckoning of their dates is found, not in the Holy
Scriptures which are called canonical, but in others, among which are also the books of the
Maccabees. These are held as canonical, not by the Jews, but by the Church, on account of
the extreme and wonderful sufferings of certain martyrs, who, before Christ had come in
the flesh, contended for the law of God even unto death, and endured most grievous and
horrible evils.</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—That Prophetic Records are Found Which are More Ancient Than
Any Fountain of the Gentile Philosophy.</head>
<p>In the time of our prophets, then, whose writings had already come to the knowledge
of almost all nations, the philosophers of the nations had not yet arisen,—at least, not those
who were called by that name, which originated with Pythagoras the Samian, who was becoming
famous at the time when the Jewish captivity ended. Much more, then, are the
other philosophers found to be later than the prophets. For even Socrates the Athenian,
the master of all who were then most famous, holding the pre-eminence in that department
that is called the moral or active, is found after Esdras in the chronicles. Plato also was born
not much later, who far out went the other disciples of Socrates. If, besides these, we take
their predecessors, who had not yet been styled philosophers, to wit, the seven sages, and
then the physicists, who succeeded Thales, and imitated his studious search into the nature
of things, namely, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Anaxagoras, and some others, before
Pythagoras first professed himself a philosopher, even these did not precede the whole of
our prophets in antiquity of time, since Thales, whom the others succeeded, is said to have
flourished in the reign of Romulus, when the stream of prophecy burst forth from the
fountains of Israel in those writings which spread over the whole world. So that only those
theological poets, Orpheus, Linus, and Musæus, and, it may be, some others among the
Greeks, are found earlier in date than the Hebrew prophets whose writings we hold as authoritative.
But not even these preceded in time our true divine, Moses, who authentically
preached the one true God, and whose writings are first in the authoritative canon; and
therefore the Greeks, in whose tongue the literature of this age chiefly appears, have no
ground for boasting of their wisdom, in which our religion, wherein is true wisdom, is not
evidently more ancient at least, if not superior. Yet it must be confessed that before Moses
there had already been, not indeed among the Greeks, but among barbarous nations, as in
Egypt, some doctrine which might be called their wisdom, else it would not have been
written in the holy books that Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,1212 as
he was, when, being born there, and adopted and nursed by Pharaoh’s daughter, he was
also liberally educated. Yet not even the wisdom of the Egyptians could be antecedent in
time to the wisdom of our prophets, because even Abraham was a prophet. And what wisdom
could there be in Egypt before Isis had given them letters, whom they thought fit to worship
as a goddess after her death? Now Isis is declared to have been the daughter of Inachus,
who first began to reign in Argos when the grandsons of Abraham are known to have been
already born.</p>

<head>Chapter 38.—That the Ecclesiastical Canon Has Not Admitted Certain Writings on
Account of Their Too Great Antiquity, Lest Through Them False Things Should
Be Inserted Instead of True.</head>
<p>If I may recall far more ancient times, our patriarch Noah was certainly even before that
great deluge, and I might not undeservedly call him a prophet, forasmuch as the ark he
made, in which he escaped with his family, was itself a prophecy of our times.1213 What of
Enoch, the seventh from Adam? Does not the canonical epistle of the Apostle Jude declare
that he prophesied?1214 But the writings of these men could not be held as authoritative
either among the Jews or us, on account of their too great antiquity, which made it seem
needful to regard them with suspicion, lest false things should be set forth instead of true.
For some writings which are said be theirs are quoted by those who, according to their own
humor, loosely believe what they please. But the purity of the canon has not admitted these
writings, not because the authority of these men who pleased God is rejected, but because
they are not believed to be theirs. Nor ought it to appear strange if writings for which so
great antiquity is claimed are held in suspicion, seeing that in the very history of the kings
of Judah and Israel containing their acts, which we believe to belong to the canonical
Scripture, very many things are mentioned which are not explained there, but are said to
be found in other books which the prophets wrote, the very names of these prophets being
sometimes given, and yet they are not found in the canon which the people of God received.
Now I confess the reason of this is hidden from me; only I think that even those men, to
whom certainly the Holy Spirit revealed those things which ought to be held as of religious
authority, might write some things as men by historical diligence, and others as prophets
by divine inspiration; and these things were so distinct, that it was judged that the former
should be ascribed to themselves, but the latter to God speaking through them: and so the
one pertained to the abundance of knowledge, the other to the authority of religion. In that
authority the canon is guarded. So that, if any writings outside of it are now brought forward
under the name of the ancient prophets, they cannot serve even as an aid to knowledge,
because it is uncertain whether they are genuine; and on this account they are not trusted,
especially those of them in which some things are found that are even contrary to the truth
of the canonical books, so that it is quite apparent they do not belong to them.</p>

<head>Chapter 39.—About the Hebrew Written Characters Which that Language Always
Possessed.</head>
<p>Now we must not believe that Heber, from whose name the word Hebrew is derived,
preserved and transmitted the Hebrew language to Abraham only as a spoken language,
and that the Hebrew letters began with the giving of the law through Moses; but rather that
this language, along with its letters, was preserved by that succession of fathers. Moses, indeed,
appointed some among the people of God to teach letters, before they could know
any letters of the divine law. The Scripture calls these men γραμματεισαγωγεῖς, who may
be called in Latin inductores or introductores of letters, because they, as it were, introduce
them into the hearts of the learners, or rather lead those whom they teach into them.
Therefore no nation could vaunt itself over our patriarchs and prophets by any wicked
vanity for the antiquity of its wisdom; since not even Egypt, which is wont falsely and vainly
to glory in the antiquity of her doctrines, is found to have preceded in time the wisdom of
our patriarchs in her own wisdom, such as it is. Neither will any one dare to say that they
were most skillful in wonderful sciences before they knew letters, that is, before Isis came
and taught them there. Besides, what, for the most part, was that memorable doctrine of
theirs which was called wisdom but astronomy, and it may be some other sciences of that
kind, which usually have more power to exercise men’s wit than to enlighten their minds
with true wisdom? As regards philosophy, which professes to teach men something which
shall make them happy, studies of that kind flourished in those lands about the times of
Mercury, whom they called Trismegistus, long before the sages and philosophers of Greece,
but yet after Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and even after Moses himself. At that time,
indeed, when Moses was born, Atlas is found to have lived, that great astronomer, the
brother of Prometheus, and maternal grandson of the elder Mercury, of whom that Mercury
Trismegistus was the grandson.</p>

<head>Chapter 40.—About the Most Mendacious Vanity of the Egyptians, in Which They
Ascribe to Their Science an Antiquity of a Hundred Thousand Years.</head>
<p>In vain, then, do some babble with most empty presumption, saying that Egypt has
understood the reckoning of the stars for more than a hundred thousand years. For in what
books have they collected that number who learned letters from Isis their mistress, not much
more than two thousand years ago? Varro, who has declared this, is no small authority in
history, and it does not disagree with the truth of the divine books. For as it is not yet six
thousand years since the first man, who is called Adam, are not those to be ridiculed rather
than refuted who try to persuade us of anything regarding a space of time so different from,
and contrary to, the ascertained truth? For what historian of the past should we credit more
than him who has also predicted things to come which we now see fulfilled? And the very
disagreement of the historians among themselves furnishes a good reason why we ought
rather to believe him who does not contradict the divine history which we hold. But, on
the other hand, the citizens of the impious city, scattered everywhere through the earth,
when they read the most learned writers, none of whom seems to be of contemptible authority,
and find them disagreeing among themselves about affairs most remote from the memory
of our age, cannot find out whom they ought to trust. But we, being sustained by divine
authority in the history of our religion, have no doubt that whatever is opposed to it is most
false, whatever may be the case regarding other things in secular books, which, whether true
or false, yield nothing of moment to our living rightly and happily.</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—About the Discord of Philosophic Opinion, and the Concord of the
Scriptures that are Held as Canonical by the Church.</head>
<p>But let us omit further examination of history, and return to the philosophers from
whom we digressed to these things. They seem to have labored in their studies for no other
end than to find out how to live in a way proper for laying hold of blessedness. Why, then,
have the disciples dissented from their masters, and the fellow-disciples from one another,
except because as men they have sought after these things by human sense and human
reasonings? Now, although there might be among them a desire of glory, so that each wished
to be thought wiser and more acute than another, and in no way addicted to the judgment
of others, but the inventor of his own dogma and opinion, yet I may grant that there were
some, or even very many of them, whose love of truth severed them from their teachers or
fellow-disciples, that they might strive for what they thought was the truth, whether it was
so or not. But what can human misery do, or how or where can it reach forth, so as to attain
blessedness, if divine authority does not lead it? Finally, let our authors, among whom the
canon of the sacred books is fixed and bounded, be far from disagreeing in any respect. It
is not without good reason, then, that not merely a few people prating in the schools and
gymnasia in captious disputations, but so many and great people, both learned and unlearned,
in countries and cities, have believed that God spoke to them or by them, i.e. the canonical
writers, when they wrote these books. There ought, indeed, to be but few of them, lest on
account of their multitude what ought to be religiously esteemed should grow cheap; and
yet not so few that their agreement should not be wonderful. For among the multitude of
philosophers, who in their works have left behind them the monuments of their dogmas,
no one will easily find any who agree in all their opinions. But to show this is too long a
task for this work.</p>
<p>But what author of any sect is so approved in this demon-worshipping city, that the rest
who have differed from or opposed him in opinion have been disapproved? The Epicureans
asserted that human affairs were not under the providence of the gods; and the Stoics,
holding the opposite opinion, agreed that they were ruled and defended by favora ble and
tutelary gods. Yet were not both sects famous among the Athenians? I wonder, then, why
Anaxagoras was accused of a crime for saying that the sun was a burning stone, and denying
that it was a god at all; while in the same city Epicurus flourished gloriously and lived securely,
although he not only did not believe that the sun or any star was a god, but contended that
neither Jupiter nor any of the gods dwelt in the world at all, so that the prayers and supplications
of men might reach them! Were not both Aristippus and Antisthenes there, two
noble philosophers and both Socratic? yet they placed the chief end of life within bounds
so diverse and contradictory, that the first made the delight of the body the chief good, while
the other asserted that man was made happy mainly by the virtue of the mind. The one also
said that the wise man should flee from the republic; the other, that he should administer

<pb n="882"/>
its affairs. Yet did not each gather disciples to follow his own sect? Indeed, in the conspicuous
and well-known porch, in gymnasia, in gardens, in places public and private, they openly
strove in bands each for his own opinion, some asserting there was one world, others innumerable
worlds; some that this world had a beginning, others that it had not; some that it
would perish, others that it would exist always; some that it was governed by the divine
mind, others by chance and accident; some that souls are immortal, others that they are
mortal,—and of those who asserted their immortality, some said they transmigrated through
beasts, others that it was by no means so; while of those who asserted their mortality, some
said they perished immediately after the body, others that they survived either a little while
or a longer time, but not always; some fixing supreme good in the body, some in the mind,
some in both; others adding to the mind and body external good things; some thinking that
the bodily senses ought to be trusted always, some not always, others never. Now what
people, senate, power, or public dignity of the impious city has ever taken care to judge
between all these and other well-nigh innumerable dissensions of the philosophers, approving
and accepting some, and disapproving and rejecting others? Has it not held in its bosom
at random, without any judgment, and confusedly, so many controversies of men at variance,
not about fields, houses, or anything of a pecuniary nature, but about those things which
make life either miserable or happy? Even if some true things were said in it, yet falsehoods
were uttered with the same licence; so that such a city has not amiss received the title of the
mystic Babylon. For Babylon means confusion, as we remember we have already explained.
Nor does it matter to the devil, its king, how they wrangle among themselves in contradictory
errors, since all alike deservedly belong to him on account of their great and varied impiety.</p>
<p>But that nation, that people, that city, that republic, these Israelites, to whom the oracles
of God were entrusted, by no means confounded with similar licence false prophets with
the true prophets; but, agreeing together, and differing in nothing, acknowledged and upheld
the authentic authors of their sacred books. These were their philosophers, these were their
sages, divines, prophets, and teachers of probity and piety. Whoever was wise and lived
according to them was wise and lived not according to men, but according to God who hath
spoken by them. If sacrilege is forbidden there, God hath forbidden it. If it is said, “Honor
thy father and thy mother,”1215 God hath commanded it. If it is said, “Thou shall not
commit adultery, Thou shall not kill, Thou shall not steal,”1216 and other similar commandments,
not human lips but the divine oracles have enounced them. Whatever truth certain
philosophers, amid their false opinions, were able to see, and strove by laborious discussions
to persuade men of,—such as that God had made this world, and Himself most providently
governs it, or of the nobility of the virtues, of the love of country, of fidelity in friendship,

what end and what rule all these things were to be referred,—all these, by words prophetic,
that is, divine, although spoken by men, were commended to the people in that city, and
not inculcated by contention in arguments, so that he who should know them might be

<head>Chapter 42.—By What Dispensation of God’s Providence the Sacred Scriptures of
the Old Testament Were Translated Out of Hebrew into Greek, that They Might
Be Made Known to All the Nations.</head>
<p>One of the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt, desired to know and have these sacred books. For
after Alexander of Macedon, who is also styled the Great, had by his most wonderful, but
by no means enduring power, subdued the whole of Asia, yea, almost the whole world,
partly by force of arms, partly by terror, and, among other kingdoms of the East, had entered
and obtained Judea also, on his death his generals did not peaceably divide that most ample
kingdom among them for a possession, but rather dissipated it, wasting all things by wars.
Then Egypt began to have the Ptolemies as her kings. The first of them, the son of Lagus,
carried many captive out of Judea into Egypt. But another Ptolemy, called Philadelphus,
who succeeded him, permitted all whom he had brought under the yoke to return free; and
more than that, sent kingly gifts to the temple of God, and begged Eleazar, who was the high
priest, to give him the Scriptures, which he had heard by report were truly divine, and
therefore greatly desired to have in that most noble library he had made. When the high
priest had sent them to him in Hebrew, he afterwards demanded interpreters of him, and
there were given him seventy-two, out of each of the twelve tribes six men, most learned in
both languages, to wit, the Hebrew and Greek and their translation is now by custom called
the Septuagint. It is reported, indeed, that there was an agreement in their words so wonderful,
stupendous, and plainly divine, that when they had sat at this work, each one apart
(for so it pleased Ptolemy to test their fidelity), they differed from each other in no word
which had the same meaning and force, or, in the order of the words; but, as if the translators
had been one, so what all had translated was one, because in very deed the one Spirit had
been in them all. And they received so wonderful a gift of God, in order that the authority
of these Scriptures might be commended not as human but divine, as indeed it was, for the
benefit of the nations who should at some time believe, as we now see them doing.</p>

<head>Chapter 43.—Of the Authority of the Septuagint Translation, Which, Saving the
Honor of the Hebrew Original, is to Be Preferred to All Translations.</head>
<p>For while there were other interpreters who translated these sacred oracles out of the
Hebrew tongue into Greek, as Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and also that translation
which, as the name of the author is unknown, is quoted as the fifth edition, yet the Church
has received this Septuagint translation just as if it were the only one; and it has been used
by the Greek Christian people, most of whom are not aware that there is any other. From
this translation there has also been made a translation in the Latin tongue, which the Latin
churches use. Our times, however, have enjoyed the advantage of the presbyter Jerome, a
man most learned, and skilled in all three languages, who translated these same Scriptures
into the Latin speech, not from the Greek, but from the Hebrew.1217 But although the Jews
acknowledge this very learned labor of his to be faithful, while they contend that the Septuagint
translators have erred in many places, still the churches of Christ judge that no one
should be preferred to the authority of so many men, chosen for this very great work by
Eleazar, who was then high priest; for even if there had not appeared in them one spirit,
without doubt divine, and the seventy learned men had, after the manner of men, compared
together the words of their translation, that what pleased them all might stand, no single
translator ought to be preferred to them; but since so great a sign of divinity has appeared
in them, certainly, if any other translator of their Scriptures from the Hebrew into any other
tongue is faithful, in that case he agrees with these seventy translators, and if he is not found
to agree with them, then we ought to believe that the prophetic gift is with them. For the
same Spirit who was in the prophets when they spoke these things was also in the seventy
men when they translated them, so that assuredly they could also say something else, just
as if the prophet himself had said both, because it would be the same Spirit who said both;
and could say the same thing differently, so that, although the words were not the same, yet
the same meaning should shine forth to those of good understanding; and could omit or
add something, so that even by this it might be shown that there was in that work not human
bondage, which the translator owed to the words, but rather divine power, which filled and
ruled the mind of the translator. Some, however, have thought that the Greek copies of the
Septuagint version should be emended from the Hebrew copies; yet they did not dare to
take away what the Hebrew lacked and the Septuagint had, but only added what was found
in the Hebrew copies and was lacking in the Septuagint, and noted them by placing at the
beginning of the verses certain marks in the form of stars which they call asterisks. And
those things which the Hebrew copies have not, but the Septuagint have, they have in like

manner marked at the beginning of the verses by horizontal spit-shaped marks like those
by which we denote ounces; and many copies having these marks are circulated even in
Latin.1218 But we cannot, without inspecting both kinds of copies, find out those things
which are neither omitted nor added, but expressed differently, whether they yield another
meaning not in itself unsuitable, or can be shown to explain the same meaning in another
way. If, then, as it behoves us, we behold nothing else in these Scriptures than what the
Spirit of God has spoken through men, if anything is in the Hebrew copies and is not in the
version of the Seventy, the Spirit of God did not choose to say it through them, but only
through the prophets. But whatever is in the Septuagint and not in the Hebrew copies, the
same Spirit chose rather to say through the latter, thus showing that both were prophets.
For in that manner He spoke as He chose, some things through Isaiah, some through
Jeremiah, some through several prophets, or else the same thing through this prophet and
through that. Further, whatever is found in both editions, that one and the same Spirit
willed to say through both, but so as that the former preceded in prophesying, and the latter
followed in prophetically interpreting them; because, as the one Spirit of peace was in the
former when they spoke true and concordant words, so the selfsame one Spirit hath appeared
in the latter, when, without mutual conference they yet interpreted all things as if with one
mouth.</p>

<head>Chapter 44.—How the Threat of the Destruction of the Ninevites is to Be Understood
Which in the Hebrew Extends to Forty Days, While in the Septuagint It is Contracted
to Three.</head>
<p>But some one may say, “How shall I know whether the prophet Jonah said to the
Ninevites, ‘Yet three days and Nineveh shall be overthrown,’ or forty days?”1219 For who
does not see that the prophet could not say both, when he was sent to terrify the city by the
threat of imminent ruin? For if its destruction was to take place on the third day, it certainly
could not be on the fortieth; but if on the fortieth, then certainly not on the third. If, then,
I am asked which of these Jonah may have said, I rather think what is read in the Hebrew,
“Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.” Yet the Seventy, interpreting long afterward,
could say what was different and yet pertinent to the matter, and agree in the selfsame
meaning, although under a different signification. And this may admonish the reader
not to despise the authority of either, but to raise himself above the history, and search for
those things which the history itself was written to set forth. These things, indeed, took
place in the city of Nineveh, but they also signified something else too great to apply to that
city; just as, when it happened that the prophet himself was three days in the whale’s belly,
it signified besides, that He who is Lord of all the prophets should be three days in the depths
of hell. Wherefore, if that city is rightly held as prophetically representing the Church of
the Gentiles, to wit, as brought down by penitence, so as no longer to be what it had been,
since this was done by Christ in the Church of the Gentiles, which Nineveh represented,
Christ Himself was signified both by the forty and by the three days: by the forty, because
He spent that number of days with His disciples after the resurrection, and then ascended
into heaven, but by the three days, because He rose on the third day. So that, if the reader
desires nothing else than to adhere to the history of events, he may be aroused from his
sleep by the Septuagint interpreters, as well as the prophets, to search into the depth of the
prophecy, as if they had said, In the forty days seek Him in whom thou mayest also find the
three days,—the one thou wilt find in His ascension, the other in His resurrection. Because
that which could be most suitably signified by both numbers, of which one is used by Jonah
the prophet, the other by the prophecy of the Septuagint version, the one and self-same
Spirit hath spoken. I dread prolixity, so that I must not demonstrate this by many instances
in which the seventy interpreters may be thought to differ from the Hebrew, and yet, when
well understood, are found to agree. For which reason I also, according to my capacity,
following the footsteps of the apostles, who themselves have quoted prophetic testimonies
from both, that is, from the Hebrew and the Septuagint, have thought that both should be
used as authoritative, since both are one, and divine. But let us now follow out as we can
what remains.</p>

<head>Chapter 45.—That the Jews Ceased to Have Prophets After the Rebuilding of the
Temple, and from that Time Until the Birth of Christ Were Afflicted with Continual
Adversity, to Prove that the Building of Another Temple Had Been
Promised by Prophetic Voices.</head>
<p>The Jewish nation no doubt became worse after it ceased to have prophets, just at the
very time when, on the rebuilding of the temple after the captivity in Babylon, it hoped to
become better. For so, indeed, did that car nal people understand what was foretold by
Haggai the prophet, saying, “The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the
former.”1220 Now, that this is said of the new testament, he showed a little above, where he
says, evidently promising Christ, “And I will move all nations, and the desired One shall
come to all nations.”1221 In this passage the Septuagint translators giving another sense
more suitable to the body than the Head, that is, to the Church than to Christ, have said by
prophetic authority, “The things shall come that are chosen of the Lord from all nations,”
that is, men, of whom Jesus saith in the Gospel, “Many are called, but few are chosen.”1222
For by such chosen ones of the nations there is built, through the new testament, with living
stones, a house of God far more glorious than that temple was which was constructed by
king Solomon, and rebuilt after the captivity. For this reason, then, that nation had no
prophets from that time, but was afflicted with many plagues by kings of alien race, and by
the Romans themselves, lest they should fancy that this prophecy of Haggai was fulfilled by
that rebuilding of the temple.</p>
<p>For not long after, on the arrival of Alexander, it was subdued, when, although there
was no pillaging, because they dared not resist him, and thus, being very easily subdued,
received him peaceably, yet the glory of that house was not so great as it was when under
the free power of their own kings. Alexander, indeed, offered up sacrifices in the temple of
God, not as a convert to His worship in true piety, but thinking, with impious folly, that He
was to be worshipped along with false gods. Then Ptolemy son of Lagus, whom I have
already mentioned, after Alexander’s death carried them captive into Egypt. His successor,
Ptolemy Philadelphus, most benevolently dismissed them; and by him it was brought about,
as I have narrated a little before, that we should have the Septuagint version of the Scriptures.
Then they were crushed by the wars which are explained in the books of the Maccabees.
Afterward they were taken captive by Ptolemy king of Alexandria, who was called Epiphanes.
Then Antiochus king of Syria compelled them by many and most grievous evils to worship
idols, and filled the temple itself with the sacrilegious superstitions of the Gentiles. Yet their

<pb n="889"/>
most vigorous leader Judas, who is also called Maccabæus, after beating the generals of
Antiochus, cleansed it from all that defilement of idolatry.</p>
<p>But not long after, one Alcimus, although an alien from the sacerdotal tribe, was, through
ambition, made pontiff, which was an impious thing. After almost fifty years, during which
they never had peace, although they prospered in some affairs, Aristobulus first assumed
the diadem among them, and was made both king and pontiff. Before that, indeed, from
the time of their return from the Babylonish captivity and the rebuilding of the temple, they
had not kings, but generals or principes. Although a king himself may be called a prince,
from his principality in governing, and a leader, because he leads the army, but it does not
follow that all who are princes and leaders may also be called kings, as that Aristobulus was.
He was succeeded by Alexander, also both king and pontiff, who is reported to have reigned
over them cruelly. After him his wife Alexandra was queen of the Jews, and from her time
downwards more grievous evils pursued them; for this Alexandra’s sons, Aristobulus and
Hyrcanus, when contending with each other for the kingdom, called in the Roman forces
against the nation of Israel. For Hyrcanus asked assistance from them against his brother.
At that time Rome had already subdued Africa and Greece, and ruled extensively in other
parts of the world also, and yet, as if unable to bear her own weight, had, in a manner, broken
herself by her own size. For indeed she had come to grave domestic seditions, and from
that to social wars, and by and by to civil wars, and had enfeebled and worn herself out so
much, that the changed state of the republic, in which she should be governed by kings, was
now imminent. Pompey then, a most illustrious prince of the Roman people, having entered
Judea with an army, took the city, threw open the temple, not with the devotion of a suppliant,
but with the authority of a conqueror, and went, not reverently, but profanely, into the holy
of holies, where it was lawful for none but the pontiff to enter. Having established Hyrcanus
in the pontificate, and set Antipater over the subjugated nation as guardian or procurator,
as they were then called, he led Aristobulus with him bound. From that time the Jews also
began to be Roman tributaries. Afterward Cassius plundered the very temple. Then after
a few years it was their desert to have Herod, a king of foreign birth, in whose reign Christ
was born. For the time had now come signified by the prophetic Spirit through the mouth
of the patriarch Jacob, when he says, “There shall not be lacking a prince out of Judah, nor
a teacher from his loins, until He shall come for whom it is reserved; and He is the expectation
of the nations.”1223 There lacked not therefore a Jewish prince of the Jews until that
Herod, who was the first king of a foreign race received by them. Therefore it was now the
time when He should come for whom that was reserved which is promised in the New
Testament, that He should be the expectation of the nations. But it was not possible that
the nations should expect He would come, as we see they did, to do judgment in the splendor

<head>Chapter 46.—Of the Birth of Our Saviour, Whereby the Word Was Made Flesh;
And of the Dispersion of the Jews Among All Nations, as Had Been Prophesied.</head>
<p>While Herod, therefore, reigned in Judea, and Cæsar Augustus was emperor at Rome,
the state of the republic being already changed, and the world being set at peace by him,
Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judah, man manifest out of a human virgin, God hidden
out of God the Father. For so had the prophet foretold: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive in
the womb, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which, being interpreted,
is, God with us.”1224 He did many miracles that He might commend God in
Himself, some of which, even as many as seemed sufficient to proclaim Him, are contained
in the evangelic Scripture. The first of these is, that He was so wonderfully born, and the
last, that with His body raised up again from the dead He ascended into heaven. But the
Jews who slew Him, and would not believe in Him, because it behoved Him to die and rise
again, were yet more miserably wasted by the Romans, and utterly rooted out from their
kingdom, where aliens had already ruled over them, and were dispersed through the lands
(so that indeed there is no place where they are not), and are thus by their own Scriptures
a testimony to us that we have not forged the prophecies about Christ. And very many of
them, considering this, even before His passion, but chiefly after His resurrection, believed
on Him, of whom it was predicted, “Though the number of the children of Israel be as the
sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.”1225 But the rest are blinded, of whom it was
predicted, “Let their table be made before them a trap, and a retribution, and a stumblingblock.
Let their eyes be darkened lest they see, and bow down their back alway.”1226
Therefore, when they do not believe our Scriptures, their own, which they blindly read, are
fulfilled in them, lest perchance any one should say that the Christians have forged these
prophecies about Christ which are quoted under the name of the sibyl, or of others, if such
there be, who do not belong to the Jewish people. For us, indeed, those suffice which are
quoted from the books of our enemies, to whom we make our acknowledgment, on account
of this testimony which, in spite of themselves, they contribute by their possession of these
books, while they themselves are dispersed among all nations, wherever the Church of Christ
is spread abroad. For a prophecy about this thing was sent before in the Psalms, which they
also read, where it is written, “My God, His mercy shall prevent me. My God hath shown
me concerning mine enemies, that Thou shalt not slay them, lest they should at last forget
Thy law: disperse them in Thy might.”1227 Therefore God has shown the Church in her
enemies the Jews the grace of His compassion, since, as saith the apostle, “their offence is

the salvation of the Gentiles.”1228 And therefore He has not slain them, that is, He has not
let the knowledge that they are Jews be lost in them, although they have been conquered by
the Romans, lest they should forget the law of God, and their testimony should be of no
avail in this matter of which we treat. But it was not enough that he should say, “Slay them
not, lest they should at last forget Thy law,” unless he had also added, “Disperse them;” because
if they had only been in their own land with that testimony of the Scriptures, and not
every where, certainly the Church which is everywhere could not have had them as witnesses
among all nations to the prophecies which were sent before concerning Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 47.—Whether Before Christian Times There Were Any Outside of the Israelite
Race Who Belonged to the Fellowship of the Heavenly City.</head>
<p>Wherefore if we read of any foreigner—that is, one neither born of Israel nor received
by that people into the canon of the sacred books—having prophesied something about
Christ, if it has come or shall come to our knowledge, we can refer to it over and above; not
that this is necessary, even if wanting, but because it is not incongruous to believe that even
in other nations there may have been men to whom this mystery was revealed, and who
were also impelled to proclaim it, whether they were partakers of the same grace or had no
experience of it, but were taught by bad angels, who, as we know, even confessed the present
Christ, whom the Jews did not acknowledge. Nor do I think the Jews themselves dare contend
that no one has belonged to God except the Israelites, since the increase of Israel began on
the rejection of his elder brother. For in very deed there was no other people who were
specially called the people of God; but they cannot deny that there have been certain men
even of other nations who belonged, not by earthly but heavenly fellowship, to the true Israelites,
the citizens of the country that is above. Because, if they deny this, they can be most
easily confuted by the case of the holy and wonderful man Job, who was neither a native
nor a proselyte, that is, a stranger joining the people of Israel, but, being bred of the Idumean
race, arose there and died there too, and who is so praised by the divine oracle, that no man
of his times is put on a level with him as regards justice and piety. And although we do not
find his date in the chronicles, yet from his book, which for its merit the Israelites have received
as of canonical authority, we gather that he was in the third generation after Israel.
And I doubt not it was divinely provided, that from this one case we might know that among
other nations also there might be men pertaining to the spiritual Jerusalem who have lived
according to God and have pleased Him. And it is not to be supposed that this was granted
to any one, unless the one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,1229 was
divinely revealed to him; who was pre-announced to the saints of old as yet to come in the
flesh, even as He is announced to us as having come, that the self-same faith through Him
may lead all to God who are predestinated to be the city of God, the house of God, and the
temple of God. But whatever prophecies concerning the grace of God through Christ Jesus
are quoted, they may be thought to have been forged by the Christians. So that there is
nothing of more weight for confuting all sorts of aliens, if they contend about this matter,
and for supporting our friends, if they are truly wise, than to quote those divine predictions
about Christ which are written in the books of the Jews, who have been torn from their
native abode and dispersed over the whole world in order to bear this testimony, so that the
Church of Christ has everywhere increased.</p>

<head>Chapter 48.—That Haggai’s Prophecy, in Which He Said that the Glory of the House
of God Would Be Greater Than that of the First Had Been,1230 Was Really Fulfilled,
Not in the Rebuilding of the Temple, But in the Church of Christ.</head>
<p>This house of God is more glorious than that first one which was constructed of wood
and stone, metals and other precious things. Therefore the prophecy of Haggai was not
fulfilled in the rebuilding of that temple. For it can never be shown to have had so much
glory after it was rebuilt as it had in the time of Solomon; yea, rather, the glory of that house
is shown to have been diminished, first by the ceasing of prophecy, and then by the nation
itself suffering so great calamities, even to the final destruction made by the Romans, as the
things above-mentioned prove. But this house which pertains to the new testament is just
as much more glorious as the living stones, even believing, renewed men, of which it is
constructed are better. But it was typified by the rebuilding of that temple for this reason,
because the very renovation of that edifice typifies in the prophetic oracle another testament
which is called the new. When, therefore, God said by the prophet just named, “And I will
give peace in this place,”1231 He is to be understood who is typified by that typical place;
for since by that rebuilt place is typified the Church which was to be built by Christ, nothing
else can be accepted as the meaning of the saying, “I will give peace in this place,” except I
will give peace in the place which that place signifies. For all typical things seem in some
way to personate those whom they typify, as it is said by the apostle, “That Rock was
Christ.”1232 Therefore the glory of this new testament house is greater than the glory of the
old testament house; and it will show itself as greater when it shall be dedicated. For then
“shall come the desired of all nations,”1233 as we read in the Hebrew. For before His advent
He had not yet been desired by all nations. For they knew not Him whom they ought to
desire, in whom they had not believed. Then, also, according to the Septuagint interpretation
(for it also is a prophetic meaning), “shall come those who are elected of the Lord out of all
nations.” For then indeed there shall come only those who are elected, whereof the apostle
saith, “According as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world.”1234
For the Master Builder who said, “Many are called, but few are chosen,”1235 did not say
this of those who, on being called, came in such a way as to be cast out from the feast, but

<head>Chapter 49.—Of the Indiscriminate Increase of the Church, Wherein Many Reprobate
are in This World Mixed with the Elect.</head>
<p>In this wicked world, in these evil days, when the Church measures her future loftiness
by her present humility, and is exercised by goading fears, tormenting sorrows, disquieting
labors, and dangerous temptations, when she soberly rejoices, rejoicing only in hope, there
are many reprobate mingled with the good, and both are gathered together by the gospel
as in a drag net;1236 and in this world, as in a sea, both swim enclosed without distinction
in the net, until it is brought ashore, when the wicked must be separated from the good,
that in the good, as in His temple, God may be all in all. We acknowledge, indeed, that His
word is now fulfilled who spake in the psalm, and said, “I have announced and spoken; they
are multiplied above number.”1237 This takes place now, since He has spoken, first by the
mouth of his forerunner John, and afterward by His own mouth, saying, “Repent: for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand.”1238 He chose disciples, whom He also called apostles,1239
of lowly birth, unhonored, and illiterate, so that whatever great thing they might be or do,
He might be and do it in them. He had one among them whose wickedness He could use
well in order to accomplish His appointed passion, and furnish His Church an example of
bearing with the wicked. Having sown the holy gospel as much as that behoved to be done
by His bodily presence, He suffered, died, and rose again, showing by His passion what we
ought to suffer for the truth, and by His resurrection what we ought to hope for in adversity;
saving always the mystery of the sacrament, by which His blood was shed for the remission
of sins. He held converse on the earth forty days with His disciples, and in their sight ascended
into heaven, and after ten days sent the promised Holy Spirit. It was given as the chief
and most necessary sign of His coming on those who had believed, that every one of them
spoke in the tongues of all nations; thus signifying that the unity of the catholic Church
would embrace all nations, and would in like manner speak in all tongues.</p>

<head>Chapter 50.—Of the Preaching of the Gospel, Which is Made More Famous and
Powerful by the Sufferings of Its Preachers.</head>
<p>Then was fulfilled that prophecy, “Out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of
the Lord out of Jerusalem;”1240 and the prediction of the Lord Christ Himself, when, after
the resurrection, “He opened the understanding” of His amazed disciples “that they might
understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, that thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”1241
And again, when, in reply to their questioning about the day of His last coming, He said,
“It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own
power; but ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and ye shall be
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even unto the ends
of the earth.”1242 First of all, the Church spread herself abroad from Jerusalem; and when
very many in Judea and Samaria had believed, she also went into other nations by those
who announced the gospel, whom, as lights, He Himself had both prepared by His word
and kindled by His Holy Spirit. For He had said to them, “Fear ye not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul.”1243 And that they might not be frozen with fear,
they burned with the fire of charity. Finally, the gospel of Christ was preached in the whole
world, not only by those who had seen and heard Him both before His passion and after
His resurrection, but also after their death by their successors, amid the horrible persecutions,
diverse torments and deaths of the martyrs, God also bearing them witness, both with signs
and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost,1244 that the people of the
nations, believing in Him who was crucified for their redemption, might venerate with
Christian love the blood of the martyrs which they had poured forth with devilish fury, and
the very kings by whose laws the Church had been laid waste might become profitably
subject to that name they had cruelly striven to take away from the earth, and might begin
to persecute the false gods for whose sake the worshippers of the true God had formerly
been persecuted.</p>

<head>Chapter 51.—That the Catholic Faith May Be Confirmed Even by the Dissensions
of the Heretics.</head>
<p>But the devil, seeing the temples of the demons deserted, and the human race running
to the name of the liberating Mediator, has moved the heretics under the Christian name
to resist the Christian doctrine, as if they could be kept in the city of God indifferently
without any correction, just as the city of confusion indifferently held the philosophers who
were of diverse and adverse opinions. Those, therefore, in the Church of Christ who savor
anything morbid and depraved, and, on being corrected that they may savor what is
wholesome and right, contumaciously resist, and will not amend their pestiferous and deadly
dogmas, but persist in defending them, become heretics, and, going without, are to be
reckoned as enemies who serve for her discipline. For even thus they profit by their
wickedness those true catholic members of Christ, since God makes a good use even of the
wicked, and all things work together for good to them that love Him.1245 For all the enemies
of the Church, whatever error blinds or malice depraves them, exercise her patience if they
receive the power to afflict her corporally; and if they only oppose her by wicked thought,
they exercise her wisdom: but at the same time, if these enemies are loved, they exercise
her benevolence, or even her beneficence, whether she deals with them by persuasive doctrine
or by terrible discipline. And thus the devil, the prince of the impious city, when he stirs
up his own vessels against the city of God that sojourns in this world, is permitted to do her
no harm. For without doubt the divine providence procures for her both consolation through
prosperity, that she may not be broken by adversity, and trial through adversity, that she
may not be corrupted by prosperity; and thus each is tempered by the other, as we recognize
in the Psalms that voice which arises from no other cause, “According to the multitude of
my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have delighted my soul.”1246 Hence also is that
saying of the apostle, “Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.”1247</p>
<p>For it is not to be thought that what the same teacher says can at any time fail, “Whoever
will live piously in Christ shall suffer persecution.”1248 Because even when those who are
without do not rage, and thus there seems to be, and really is, tranquillity, which brings very
much consolation, especially to the weak, yet there are not wanting, yea, there are many
within who by their abandoned manners torment the hearts of those who live piously, since
by them the Christian and catholic name is blasphemed; and the dearer that name is to those
who will live piously in Christ, the more do they grieve that through the wicked, who have
a place within, it comes to be less loved than pious minds desire. The heretics themselves

<pb n="899"/>
also, since they are thought to have the Christian name and sacraments, Scriptures, and
profession, cause great grief in the hearts of the pious, both because many who wish to be
Christians are compelled by their dissensions to hesitate, and many evil-speakers also find
in them matter for blaspheming the Christian name, because they too are at any rate called
Christians. By these and similar depraved manners and errors of men, those who will live
piously in Christ suffer persecution, even when no one molests or vexes their body; for they
suffer this persecution, not in their bodies, but in their hearts. Whence is that word, “According
to the multitude of my griefs in my heart;” for he does not say, in my body. Yet,
on the other hand, none of them can perish, because the immutable divine promises are
thought of. And because the apostle says, “The Lord knoweth them that are His;1249 for
whom He did foreknow, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His
Son,”1250 none of them can perish; therefore it follows in that psalm, “Thy consolations
have delighted my soul.”1251 But that grief which arises in the hearts of the pious, who are
persecuted by the manners of bad or false Christians, is profitable to the sufferers, because
it proceeds from the charity in which they do not wish them either to perish or to hinder
the salvation of others. Finally, great consolations grow out of their chastisement, which
imbue the souls of the pious with a fecundity as great as the pains with which they were
troubled concerning their own perdition. Thus in this world, in these evil days, not only
from the time of the bodily presence of Christ and His apostles, but even from that of Abel,
whom first his wicked brother slew because he was righteous,1252 and thenceforth even to
the end of this world, the Church has gone forward on pilgrimage amid the persecutions of
the world and the consolations of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 52.—Whether We Should Believe What Some Think, That, as the Ten
Persecutions Which are Past Have Been Fulfilled, There Remains No Other
Beyond the Eleventh, Which Must Happen in the Very Time of Antichrist.</head>
<p>I do not think, indeed, that what some have thought or may think is rashly said or believed,
that until the time of Antichrist the Church of Christ is not to suffer any persecutions
besides those she has already suffered,—that is, ten,—and that the eleventh and last shall be
inflicted by Antichrist. They reckon as the first that made by Nero, the second by Domitian,
the third by Trajan, the fourth by Antoninus, the fifth by Severus, the sixth by Maximin,
the seventh by Decius, the eighth by Valerian, the ninth by Aurelian, the tenth by Diocletian
and Maximian. For as there were ten plagues in Egypt before the people of God could begin
to go out, they think this is to be referred to as showing that the last persecution by Antichrist
must be like the eleventh plague, in which the Egyptians, while following the Hebrews with
hostility, perished in the Red Sea when the people of God passed through on dry land. Yet
I do not think persecutions were prophetically signified by what was done in Egypt, however
nicely and ingeniously those who think so may seem to have compared the two in detail,
not by the prophetic Spirit, but by the conjecture of the human mind, which sometimes hits
the truth, and sometimes is deceived. But what can those who think this say of the persecution
in which the Lord Himself was crucified? In which number will they put it? And if
they think the reckoning is to be made exclusive of this one, as if those must be counted
which pertain to the body, and not that in which the Head Himself was set upon and slain,
what can they make of that one which, after Christ ascended into heaven, took place in Jerusalem,
when the blessed Stephen was stoned; when James the brother of John was
slaughtered with the sword; when the Apostle Peter was imprisoned to be killed, and was
set free by the angel; when the brethren were driven away and scattered from Jerusalem;
when Saul, who afterward became the Apostle Paul, wasted the Church; and when he himself,
publishing the glad tidings of the faith he had persecuted, suffered such things as he had
inflicted, either from the Jews or from other nations, where he most fervently preached
Christ everywhere? Why, then, do they think fit to start with Nero, when the Church in
her growth had reached the times of Nero amid the most cruel persecutions; about which
it would be too long to say anything? But if they think that only the persecutions made by
kings ought to be reckoned, it was king Herod who also made a most grievous one after the
ascension of the Lord. And what account do they give of Julian, whom they do not number
in the ten? Did not he persecute the Church, who forbade the Christians to teach or learn
liberal letters? Under him the elder Valentinian, who was the third emperor after him, stood
forth as a confessor of the Christian faith, and was dismissed from his command in the
army. I shall say nothing of what he did at Antioch, except to mention his being struck with
wonder at the freedom and cheerfulness of one most faithful and steadfast young man, who,

<pb n="901"/>
when many were seized to be tortured, was tortured during a whole day, and sang under
the instrument of torture, until the emperor feared lest he should succumb under the continued
cruelties and put him to shame at last, which made him dread and fear that he would
be yet more dishonorably put to the blush by the rest. Lastly, within our own recollection,
did not Valens the Arian, brother of the foresaid Valentinian, waste the catholic Church by
great persecution throughout the East? But how unreasonable it is not to consider that the
Church, which bears fruit and grows through the whole world, may suffer persecution from
kings in some nations even when she does not suffer it in others! Perhaps, however, it was
not to be reckoned a persecution when the king of the Goths, in Gothia itself, persecuted
the Christians with wonderful cruelty, when there were none but catholics there, of whom
very many were crowned with martyrdom, as we have heard from certain brethren who
had been there at that time as boys, and unhesitatingly called to mind that they had seen
these things? And what took place in Persia of late? Was not persecution so hot against
the Christians (if even yet it is allayed) that some of the fugitives from it came even to Roman
towns? When I think of these and the like things, it does not seem to me that the number
of persecutions with which the Church is to be tried can be definitely stated. But, on the
other hand, it is no less rash to affirm that there will be some persecutions by kings besides
that last one, about which no Christian is in doubt. Therefore we leave this undecided,
supporting or refuting neither side of this question, but only restraining men from the audacious
presumption of affirming either of them.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="53">
<pb n="902"/>
<head>Chapter 53.—Of the Hidden Time of the Final Persecution.</head>
<p>Truly Jesus Himself shall extinguish by His presence that last persecution which is to
be made by Antichrist. For so it is written, that “He shall slay him with the breath of His
mouth, and empty him with the brightness of His presence.”1253 It is customary to ask,
When shall that be? But this is quite unreasonable. For had it been profitable for us to know
this, by whom could it better have been told than by God Himself, the Master, when the
disciples questioned Him? For they were not silent when with Him, but inquired of Him,
saying, “Lord, wilt Thou at this time present the kingdom to Israel, or when?”1254 But He
said, “It is not for you to know the times, which the Father hath put in His own power.”
When they got that answer, they had not at all questioned Him about the hour, or day, or
year, but about the time. In vain, then, do we attempt to compute definitely the years that
may remain to this world, when we may hear from the mouth of the Truth that it is not for
us to know this. Yet some have said that four hundred, some five hundred, others a thousand
years, may be completed from the ascension of the Lord up to His final coming. But to
point out how each of them supports his own opinion would take too long, and is not necessary;
for indeed they use human conjectures, and bring forward nothing certain from the
authority of the canonical Scriptures. But on this subject He puts aside the figures of the
calculators, and orders silence, who says, “It is not for you to know the times, which the
Father hath put in His own power.”</p>
<p>But because this sentence is in the Gospel, it is no wonder that the worshippers of the
many and false gods have been none the less restrained from feigning that by the responses
of the demons, whom they worship as gods, it has been fixed how long the Christian religion
is to last. For when they saw that it could not be consumed by so many and great persecutions,
but rather drew from them wonderful enlargements, they invented I know not what
Greek verses, as if poured forth by a divine oracle to some one consulting it, in which, indeed,
they make Christ innocent of this, as it were, sacrilegious crime, but add that Peter by enchantments
brought it about that the name of Christ should be worshipped for three hundred
and sixty-five years, and, after the completion of that number of years, should at once take
end. Oh the hearts of learned men! Oh, learned wits, meet to believe such things about
Christ as you are not willing to believe in Christ, that His disciple Peter did not learn magic
arts from Him, yet that, although He was innocent, His disciple was an enchanter, and chose
that His name rather than his own should be worshipped through his magic arts, his great
labors and perils, and at last even the shedding of his blood! If Peter the enchanter made
the world so love Christ, what did Christ the innocent do to make Peter so love Him? Let
them answer themselves then, and, if they can, let them understand that the world, for the

<pb n="903"/>
sake of eternal life, was made to love Christ by that same supernal grace which made Peter
also love Christ for the sake of the eternal life to be received from Him, and that even to the
extent of suffering temporal death for Him. And then, what kind of gods are these who are
able to predict such things, yet are not able to avert them, succumbing in such a way to a
single enchanter and wicked magician (who, as they say, having slain a yearling boy and
torn him to pieces, buried him with nefarious rites), that they permitted the sect hostile to
themselves to gain strength for so great a time, and to surmount the horrid cruelties of so
many great persecutions, not by resisting but by suffering, and to procure the overthrow of
their own images, temples, rituals, and oracles? Finally, what god was it—not ours, certainly,
but one of their own—who was either enticed or compelled by so great wickedness to perform
these things? For those verses say that Peter bound, not any demon, but a god to do these
things. Such a god have they who have not Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter 54.—Of the Very Foolish Lie of the Pagans, in Feigning that the Christian
Religion Was Not to Last Beyond Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Years.</head>
<p>I might collect these and many similar arguments, if that year had not already passed
by which lying divination has promised, and deceived vanity has believed. But as a few
years ago three hundred and sixty-five years were completed since the time when the worship
of the name of Christ was established by His presence in the flesh, and by the apostles, what
other proof need we seek to refute that falsehood? For, not to place the beginning of this
period at the nativity of Christ, because as an infant and boy He had no disciples, yet, when
He began to have them, beyond doubt the Christian doctrine and religion then became
known through His bodily presence, that is, after He was baptized in the river Jordan by
the ministry of John. For on this account that prophecy went before concerning Him: “He
shall reign from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.”1255 But
since, before He suffered and rose from the dead, the faith had not yet been defined to all,
but was defined in the resurrection of Christ (for so the Apostle Paul speaks to the Athenians,
saying, “But now He announces to men that all everywhere should repent, because He hath
appointed a day in which to judge the world in equity, by the Man in whom He hath defined
the faith to all men, raising Him from the dead”1256), it is better that, in settling this question,
we should start from that point, especially because the Holy Spirit was then given, just as
He behoved to be given after the resurrection of Christ in that city from which the second
law, that is, the new testament, ought to begin. For the first, which is called the old testament
was given from Mount Sinai through Moses. But concerning this which was to be given by
Christ it was predicted, “Out of Sion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord out of
Jerusalem;”1257 whence He Himself said that repentance in His name behoved to be preached
among all nations, but yet beginning at Jerusalem.1258 There, therefore, the worship of this
name took its rise, that Jesus should be believed in, who died and rose again. There this
faith blazed up with such noble beginnings, that several thousand men, being converted to
the name of Christ with wonderful alacrity, sold their goods for distribution among the
needy, thus, by a holy resolution and most ardent charity, coming to voluntary poverty, and
prepared themselves, amid the Jews who raged and thirsted for their blood, to contend for
the truth even to death, not with armed power, but with more powerful patience. If this
was accomplished by no magic arts, why do they hesitate to believe that the other could be
done throughout the whole world by the same divine power by which this was done? But
supposing Peter wrought that enchantment so that so great a multitude of men at Jerusalem

<pb n="905"/>
was thus kindled to worship the name of Christ, who had either seized and fastened Him
to the cross, or reviled Him when fastened there, we must still inquire when the three hundred
and sixty-five years must be completed, counting from that year. Now Christ died when
the Gemini were consuls, on the eighth day before the kalends of April. He rose the third
day, as the apostles have proved by the evidence of their own senses. Then forty days after,
He ascended into heaven. Ten days after, that is, on the fiftieth after his resurrection, He
sent the Holy Spirit; then three thousand men believed when the apostles preached Him.
Then, therefore, arose the worship of that name, as we believe, and according to the real
truth, by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, but, as impious vanity has feigned or thought, by
the magic arts of Peter. A little afterward, too, on a wonderful sign being wrought, when at
Peter’s own word a certain beggar, so lame from his mother’s womb that he was carried by
others and laid down at the gate of the temple, where he begged alms, was made whole in
the name of Jesus Christ, and leaped up, five thousand men believed, and thenceforth the
Church grew by sundry accessions of believers. Thus we gather the very day with which
that year began, namely, that on which the Holy Spirit was sent, that is, during the ides of
May. And, on counting the consuls, the three hundred and sixty-five years are found completed
on the same ides in the consulate of Honorius and Eutychianus. Now, in the following
year, in the consulate of Mallius Theodorus, when, according to that oracle of the demons
or figment of men, there ought already to have been no Christian religion, it was not necessary
to inquire, what perchance was done in other parts of the earth. But, as we know, in the
most noted and eminent city, Carthage, in Africa, Gaudentius and Jovius, officers of the
Emperor Honorius, on the fourteenth day before the kalends of April, overthrew the temples
and broke the images of the false gods. And from that time to the present, during almost
thirty years, who does not see how much the worship of the name of Christ has increased,
especially after many of those became Christians who had been kept back from the faith by
thinking that divination true, but saw when that same number of years was completed that
it was empty and ridiculous? We, therefore, who are called and are Christians, do not believe
in Peter, but in Him whom Peter believed,—being edified by Peter’s sermons about Christ,
not poisoned by his incantations; and not deceived by his enchantments, but aided by his
good deeds. Christ Himself, who was Peter’s Master in the doctrine which leads to eternal
life, is our Master too.</p>
<p>But let us now at last finish this book, after thus far treating of, and showing as far as
seemed sufficient, what is the mortal course of the two cities, the heavenly and the earthly,
which are mingled together from the beginning down to the end. Of these, the earthly one
has made to herself of whom she would, either from any other quarter, or even from among
men, false gods whom she might serve by sacrifice; but she which is heavenly and is a pilgrim
on the earth does not make false gods, but is herself made by the true God of whom she
herself must be the true sacrifice. Yet both alike either enjoy temporal good things, or are

<pb n="906"/>
afflicted with temporal evils, but with diverse faith, diverse hope, and diverse love, until they
must be separated by the last judgment, and each must receive her own end, of which there
is no end. About these ends of both we must next treat.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—That Varro Has Made Out that Two Hundred and Eighty-Eight Different
Sects of Philosophy Might Be Formed by the Various Opinions Regarding the
Supreme Good.</head>
<p>As I see that I have still to discuss the fit destinies of the two cities, the earthly and the
heavenly, I must first explain, so far as the limits of this work allow me, the reasonings by
which men have attempted to make for themselves a happiness in this unhappy life, in order
that it may be evident, not only from divine authority, but also from such reasons as can be
adduced to unbelievers, how the empty dreams of the philosophers differ from the hope
which God gives to us, and from the substantial fulfillment of it which He will give us as
our blessedness. Philosophers have expressed a great variety of diverse opinions regarding
the ends of goods and of evils, and this question they have eagerly canvassed, that they might,
if possible, discover what makes a man happy. For the end of our good is that for the sake
of which other things are to be desired, while it is to be desired for its own sake; and the end
of evil is that on account of which other things are to be shunned, while it is avoided on its
own account. Thus, by the end of good, we at present mean, not that by which good is destroyed,
so that it no longer exists, but that by which it is finished, so that it becomes complete;
and by the end of evil we mean, not that which abolishes it, but that which completes its
development. These two ends, therefore, are the supreme good and the supreme evil; and,
as I have said, those who have in this vain life professed the study of wisdom have been at
great pains to discover these ends, and to obtain the supreme good and avoid the supreme
evil in this life. And although they erred in a variety of ways, yet natural insight has prevented
them from wandering from the truth so far that they have not placed the supreme good and
evil, some in the soul, some in the body, and some in both. From this tripartite distribution
of the sects of philosophy, Marcus Varro, in his book De Philosophia,1259 has drawn so large
a variety of opinions, that, by a subtle and minute analysis of distinctions, he numbers
without difficulty as many as 288 sects,—not that these have actually existed, but sects which
are possible.</p>
<p>To illustrate briefly what he means, I must begin with his own introductory statement
in the above-mentioned book, that there are four things which men desire, as it were by
nature without a master, without the help of any instruction, without industry or the art of
living which is called virtue, and which is certainly learned:1260 either pleasure, which is
an agreeable stirring of the bodily sense; or repose, which excludes every bodily inconveni-

<note type="footnote">1260 Alluding to the vexed question whether virtue could be taught.</note>

<pb n="909"/>
ence; or both these, which Epicurus calls by the one name, pleasure; or the primary objects
of nature,1261 which comprehend the things already named and other things, either bodily,
such as health, and safety, and integrity of the members, or spiritual, such as the greater and
less mental gifts that are found in men. Now these four things—pleasure, repose, the two
combined, and the primary objects of nature—exist in us in such sort that we must either
desire virtue on their account, or them for the sake of virtue, or both for their own sake;
and consequently there arise from this distinction twelve sects, for each is by this consideration
tripled. I will illustrate this in one instance, and, having done so, it will not be difficult
to understand the others. According, then, as bodily pleasure is subjected, preferred, or
united to virtue, there are three sects. It is subjected to virtue when it is chosen as subservient
to virtue. Thus it is a duty of virtue to live for one’s country, and for its sake to beget children,
neither of which can be done without bodily pleasure. For there is pleasure in eating and
drinking, pleasure also in sexual intercourse. But when it is preferred to virtue, it is desired
for its own sake, and virtue is chosen only for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the
attainment or preservation of bodily pleasure. And this, indeed, is to make life hideous; for
where virtue is the slave of pleasure it no longer deserves the name of virtue. Yet even this
disgraceful distortion has found some philosophers to patronize and defend it. Then virtue
is united to pleasure when neither is desired for the other’s sake, but both for their own.
And therefore, as pleasure, according as it is subjected, preferred, or united to virtue, makes
three sects, so also do repose, pleasure and repose combined, and the prime natural blessings,
make their three sects each. For as men’s opinions vary, and these four things are sometimes
subjected, sometimes preferred, and sometimes united to virtue, there are produced twelve
sects. But this number again is doubled by the addition of one difference, viz., the social
life; for whoever attaches himself to any of these sects does so either for his own sake alone,
or for the sake of a companion, for whom he ought to wish what he desires for himself.
And thus there will be twelve of those who think some one of these opinions should be held
for their own sakes, and other twelve who decide that they ought to follow this or that
philosophy not for their own sakes only, but also for the sake of others whose good they
desire as their own. These twenty-four sects again are doubled, and become forty-eight by
adding a difference taken from the New Academy. For each of these four and twenty sects
can hold and defend their opinion as certain, as the Stoics defended the position that the
supreme good of man consisted solely in virtue; or they can be held as probable, but not
certain, as the New Academics did. There are, therefore, twenty-four who hold their
philosophy as certainly true, other twenty-four who hold their opinions as probable, but
not certain. Again, as each person who attaches himself to any of these sects may adopt the
mode of life either of the Cynics or of the other philosophers, this distinction will double
<note type="footnote">1261 The prima naturæ, or πρῶτα κατὰ φύσιν of the Stoics.</note>

<pb n="910"/>
the number, and so make ninety-six sects. Then, lastly, as each of these sects may be adhered
to either by men who love a life of ease, as those who have through choice or necessity addicted
themselves to study, or by men who love a busy life, as those who, while philosophizing,
have been much occupied with state affairs and public business, or by men who choose
a mixed life, in imitation of those who have apportioned their time partly to erudite leisure,
partly to necessary business: by these differences the number of the sects is tripled, and
becomes 288.</p>
<p>I have thus, as briefly and lucidly as I could, given in my own words the opinions which
Varro expresses in his book. But how he refutes all the rest of these sects, and chooses one,
the Old Academy, instituted by Plato, and continuing to Polemo, the fourth teacher of that
school of philosophy which held that their system was certain; and how on this ground he
distinguishes it from the New Academy,1262 which began with Polemo’s successor Arcesilaus,
and held that all things are uncertain; and how he seeks to establish that the Old Academy
was as free from error as from doubt,—all this, I say, were too long to enter upon in detail,
and yet I must not altogether pass it by in silence. Varro then rejects, as a first step, all those
differences which have multiplied the number of sects; and the ground on which he does
so is that they are not differences about the supreme good. He maintains that in philosophy
a sect is created only by its having an opinion of its own different from other schools on the
point of the ends-in-chief. For man has no other reason for philosophizing than that he
may be happy; but that which makes him happy is itself the supreme good. In other words,
the supreme good is the reason of philosophizing; and therefore that cannot be called a sect
of philosophy which pursues no way of its own towards the supreme good. Thus, when it
is asked whether a wise man will adopt the social life, and desire and be interested in the
supreme good of his friend as in his own, or will, on the contrary, do all that he does merely
for his own sake, there is no question here about the supreme good, but only about the
propriety of associating or not associating a friend in its participation: whether the wise
man will do this not for his own sake, but for the sake of his friend in whose good he delights
as in his own. So, too, when it is asked whether all things about which philosophy is concerned
are to be considered uncertain, as by the New Academy, or certain, as the other
philosophers maintain, the question here is not what end should be pursued, but whether
or not we are to believe in the substantial existence of that end; or, to put it more plainly,
whether he who pursues the supreme good must maintain that it is a true good, or only that
it appears to him to be true, though possibly it may be delusive,—both pursuing one and
the same good. The distinction, too, which is founded on the dress and manners of the
Cynics, does not touch the question of the chief good, but only the question whether he
who pursues that good which seems to himself true should live as do the Cynics. There
<note type="footnote">1262 Frequently called the Middle Academy; the New beginning with Carneades.</note>

<pb n="911"/>
were, in fact, men who, though they pursued different things as the supreme good, some
choosing pleasure, others virtue, yet adopted that mode of life which gave the Cynics their
name. Thus, whatever it is which distinguishes the Cynics from other philosophers, this
has no bearing on the choice and pursuit of that good which constitutes happiness. For if
it had any such bearing, then the same habits of life would necessitate the pursuit of the
same chief good, and diverse habits would necessitate the pursuit of different ends.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—How Varro, by Removing All the Differences Which Do Not Form
Sects, But are Merely Secondary Questions, Reaches Three Definitions of the
Chief Good, of Which We Must Choose One.</head>
<p>The same may be said of those three kinds of life, the life of studious leisure and search
after truth, the life of easy engagement in affairs, and the life in which both these are mingled.
When it is asked, which of these should be adopted, this involves no controversy about the
end of good, but inquires which of these three puts a man in the best position for finding
and retaining the supreme good. For this good, as soon as a man finds it, makes him happy;
but lettered leisure, or public business, or the alternation of these, do not necessarily constitute
happiness. Many, in fact, find it possible to adopt one or other of these modes of life, and
yet to miss what makes a man happy. The question, therefore, regarding the supreme good
and the supreme evil, and which distinguishes sects of philosophy, is one; and these questions
concerning the social life, the doubt of the Academy, the dress and food of the Cynics, the
three modes of life—the active, the contemplative, and the mixed—these are different
questions, into none of which the question of the chief good enters. And therefore, as
Marcus Varro multiplied the sects to the number of 288 (or whatever larger number he
chose) by introducing these four differences derived from the social life, the New Academy,
the Cynics, and the threefold form of life, so, by removing these differences as having no
bearing on the supreme good, and as therefore not constituting what can properly be called
sects, he returns to those twelve schools which concern themselves with inquiring what that
good is which makes man happy, and he shows that one of these is true, the rest false. In
other words, he dismisses the distinction founded on the threefold mode of life, and so decreases
the whole number by two-thirds, reducing the sects to ninety-six. Then, putting
aside the Cynic peculiarities, the number decreases by a half, to forty-eight. Taking away
next the distinction occasioned by the hesitancy of the New Academy, the number is again
halved, and reduced to twenty-four. Treating in a similar way the diversity introduced by
the consideration of the social life, there are left but twelve, which this difference had doubled
to twenty-four. Regarding these twelve, no reason can be assigned why they should not be
called sects. For in them the sole inquiry is regarding the supreme good and the ultimate
evil,—that is to say, regarding the supreme good, for this being found, the opposite evil is
thereby found. Now, to make these twelve sects, he multiplies by three these four
things—pleasure, repose, pleasure and repose combined, and the primary objects of nature
which Varro calls primigenia. For as these four things are sometimes subordinated to virtue,
so that they seem to be desired not for their own sake, but for virtue’s sake; sometimes preferred
to it, so that virtue seems to be necessary not on its own account, but in order to attain
these things; sometimes joined with it, so that both they and virtue are desired for their own
sakes,—we must multiply the four by three, and thus we get twelve sects. But from those

<pb n="913"/>
four things Varro eliminates three—pleasure, repose, pleasure and repose combined—not
because he thinks these are not worthy of the place assigned them, but because they are included
in the primary objects of nature. And what need is there, at any rate, to make a
threefold division out of these two ends, pleasure and repose, taking them first severally and
then conjunctly, since both they, and many other things besides, are comprehended in the
primary objects of nature? Which of the three remaining sects must be chosen? This is the
question that Varro dwells upon. For whether one of these three or some other be chosen,
reason forbids that more than one be true. This we shall afterwards see; but meanwhile let
us explain as briefly and distinctly as we can how Varro makes his selection from these three,
that is, from the sects which severally hold that the primary objects of nature are to be desired
for virtue’s sake, that virtue is to be desired for their sake, and that virtue and these objects
are to be desired each for their own sake.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="914"/>
<head>Chapter 3.—Which of the Three Leading Opinions Regarding the Chief Good Should
Be Preferred, According to Varro, Who Follows Antiochus and the Old Academy.</head>
<p>Which of these three is true and to be adopted he attempts to show in the following
manner. As it is the supreme good, not of a tree, or of a beast, or of a god, but of man that
philosophy is in quest of, he thinks that, first of all, we must define man. He is of opinion
that there are two parts in human nature, body and soul, and makes no doubt that of these
two the soul is the better and by far the more worthy part. But whether the soul alone is the
man, so that the body holds the same relation to it as a horse to the horseman, this he thinks
has to be ascertained. The horseman is not a horse and a man, but only a man, yet he is
called a horseman, because he is in some relation to the horse. Again, is the body alone the
man, having a relation to the soul such as the cup has to the drink? For it is not the cup and
the drink it contains which are called the cup, but the cup alone; yet it is so called because
it is made to hold the drink. Or, lastly, is it neither the soul alone nor the body alone, but
both together, which are man, the body and the soul being each a part, but the whole man
being both together, as we call two horses yoked together a pair, of which pair the near and
the off horse is each a part, but we do not call either of them, no matter how connected with
the other, a pair, but only both together? Of these three alternatives, then, Varro chooses
the third, that man is neither the body alone, nor the soul alone, but both together. And
therefore the highest good, in which lies the happiness of man, is composed of goods of
both kinds, both bodily and spiritual. And consequently he thinks that the primary objects
of nature are to be sought for their own sake, and that virtue, which is the art of living, and
can be communicated by instruction, is the most excellent of spiritual goods. This virtue,
then, or art of regulating life, when it has received these primary objects of nature which
existed independently of it, and prior to any instruction, seeks them all, and itself also, for
its own sake; and it uses them, as it also uses itself, that from them all it may derive profit
and enjoyment, greater or less, according as they are themselves greater or less; and while
it takes pleasure in all of them, it despises the less that it may obtain or retain the greater
when occasion demands. Now, of all goods, spiritual or bodily, there is none at all to compare
with virtue. For virtue makes a good use both of itself and of all other goods in which lies
man’s happiness; and where it is absent, no matter how many good things a man has, they
are not for his good, and consequently should not be called good things while they belong
to one who makes them useless by using them badly. The life of man, then, is called happy
when it enjoys virtue and these other spiritual and bodily good things without which virtue
is impossible. It is called happier if it enjoys some or many other good things which are not
essential to virtue; and happiest of all, if it lacks not one of the good things which pertain
to the body and the soul. For life is not the same thing as virtue, since not every life, but a
wisely regulated life, is virtue; and yet, while there can be life of some kind without virtue,
there cannot be virtue without life. This I might apply to memory and reason, and such

<pb n="915"/>
mental faculties; for these exist prior to instruction, and without them there cannot be any
instruction, and consequently no virtue, since virtue is learned. But bodily advantages, such
as swiftness of foot, beauty, or strength, are not essential to virtue, neither is virtue essential
to them, and yet they are good things; and, according to our philosophers, even these advantages
are desired by virtue for its own sake, and are used and enjoyed by it in a becoming
manner.</p>
<p>They say that this happy life is also social, and loves the advantages of its friends as its
own, and for their sake wishes for them what it desires for itself, whether these friends live
in the same family, as a wife, children, domestics; or in the locality where one’s home is, as
the citizens of the same town; or in the world at large, as the nations bound in common
human brotherhood; or in the universe itself, comprehended in the heavens and the earth,
as those whom they call gods, and provide as friends for the wise man, and whom we more
familiarly call angels. Moreover, they say that, regarding the supreme good and evil, there
is no room for doubt, and that they therefore differ from the New Academy in this respect,
and they are not concerned whether a philosopher pursues those ends which they think
true in the Cynic dress and manner of life or in some other. And, lastly, in regard to the
three modes of life, the contemplative, the active, and the composite, they declare in favor
of the third. That these were the opinions and doctrines of the Old Academy, Varro asserts
on the authority of Antiochus, Cicero’s master and his own, though Cicero makes him out
to have been more frequently in accordance with the Stoics than with the Old Academy.
But of what importance is this to us, who ought to judge the matter on its own merits, rather
than to understand accurately what different men have thought about it?</p>

<pb n="916"/>
<head>Chapter 4.—What the Christians Believe Regarding the Supreme Good and Evil, in
Opposition to the Philosophers, Who Have Maintained that the Supreme Good
is in Themselves.</head>
<p>If, then, we be asked what the city of God has to say upon these points, and, in the first
place, what its opinion regarding the supreme good and evil is, it will reply that life eternal
is the supreme good, death eternal the supreme evil, and that to obtain the one and escape
the other we must live rightly. And thus it is written, “The just lives by faith,”1263 for we
do not as yet see our good, and must therefore live by faith; neither have we in ourselves
power to live rightly, but can do so only if He who has given us faith to believe in His help
do help us when we believe and pray. As for those who have supposed that the sovereign
good and evil are to be found in this life, and have placed it either in the soul or the body,
or in both, or, to speak more explicitly, either in pleasure or in virtue, or in both; in repose
or in virtue, or in both; in pleasure and repose, or in virtue, or in all combined; in the primary
objects of nature, or in virtue, or in both,—all these have, with a marvelous shallowness,
sought to find their blessedness in this life and in themselves. Contempt has been poured
upon such ideas by the Truth, saying by the prophet, “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of
men” (or, as the Apostle Paul cites the passage, “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the
wise”) “that they are vain.”1264</p>
<p>For what flood of eloquence can suffice to detail the miseries of this life? Cicero, in the
Consolation on the death of his daughter, has spent all his ability in lamentation; but how
inadequate was even his ability here? For when, where, how, in this life can these primary
objects of nature be possessed so that they may not be assailed by unforeseen accidents? Is
the body of the wise man exempt from any pain which may dispel pleasure, from any disquietude
which may banish repose? The amputation or decay of the members of the body
puts an end to its integrity, deformity blights its beauty, weakness its health, lassitude its
vigor, sleepiness or sluggishness its activity,—and which of these is it that may not assail the
flesh of the wise man? Comely and fitting attitudes and movements of the body are numbered
among the prime natural blessings; but what if some sickness makes the members tremble?
what if a man suffers from curvature of the spine to such an extent that his hands reach the
ground, and he goes upon all-fours like a quadruped? Does not this destroy all beauty and
grace in the body, whether at rest or in motion? What shall I say of the fundamental blessings
of the soul, sense and intellect, of which the one is given for the perception, and the other
for the comprehension of truth? But what kind of sense is it that remains when a man becomes
deaf and blind? where are reason and intellect when disease makes a man delirious?
We can scarcely, or not at all, refrain from tears, when we think of or see the actions and
<note type="footnote">1263 Hab. ii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1264 Ps. xciv. 11, and 1 Cor. iii. 20.</note>

<pb n="917"/>
words of such frantic persons, and consider how different from and even opposed to their
own sober judgment and ordinary conduct their present demeanor is. And what shall I say
of those who suffer from demoniacal possession? Where is their own intelligence hidden
and buried while the malignant spirit is using their body and soul according to his own
will? And who is quite sure that no such thing can happen to the wise man in this life?
Then, as to the perception of truth, what can we hope for even in this way while in the body,
as we read in the true book of Wisdom, “The corruptible body weigheth down the soul, and
the earthly tabernacle presseth down the mind that museth upon many things?”1265 And
eagerness, or desire of action, if this is the right meaning to put upon the Greek ὁρμη, is
also reckoned among the primary advantages of nature; and yet is it not this which produces
those pitiable movements of the insane, and those actions which we shudder to see, when
sense is deceived and reason deranged?</p>
<p>In fine, virtue itself, which is not among the primary objects of nature, but succeeds to
them as the result of learning, though it holds the highest place among human good things,
what is its occupation save to wage perpetual war with vices,—not those that are outside of
us, but within; not other men’s, but our own,—a war which is waged especially by that virtue
which the Greeks call σωφροσυνη, and we temperance,1266 and which bridles carnal lusts,
and prevents them from winning the consent of the spirit to wicked deeds? For we must
not fancy that there is no vice in us, when, as the apostle says, “The flesh lusteth against the
spirit;”1267 for to this vice there is a contrary virtue, when, as the same writer says, “The
spirit lusteth against the flesh.” “For these two,” he says, “are contrary one to the other, so
that you cannot do the things which you would.” But what is it we wish to do when we seek
to attain the supreme good, unless that the flesh should cease to lust against the spirit, and
that there be no vice in us against which the spirit may lust? And as we cannot attain to this
in the present life, however ardently we desire it, let us by God’s help accomplish at least
this, to preserve the soul from succumbing and yielding to the flesh that lusts against it, and
to refuse our consent to the perpetration of sin. Far be it from us, then, to fancy that while
we are still engaged in this intestine war, we have already found the happiness which we
seek to reach by victory. And who is there so wise that he has no conflict at all to maintain
against his vices?</p>
<p>What shall I say of that virtue which is called prudence? Is not all its vigilance spent in
the discernment of good from evil things, so that no mistake may be admitted about what
we should desire and what avoid? And thus it is itself a proof that we are in the midst of
evils, or that evils are in us; for it teaches us that it is an evil to consent to sin, and a good to
<note type="footnote">1265 Wisdom ix. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">1266 Cicero, Tusc. Quæst. iii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">1267 Gal. v. 17.</note>

<pb n="918"/>
refuse this consent. And yet this evil, to which prudence teaches and temperance enables
us not to consent, is removed from this life neither by prudence nor by temperance. And
justice, whose office it is to render to every man his due, whereby there is in man himself a
certain just order of nature, so that the soul is subjected to God, and the flesh to the soul,
and consequently both soul and flesh to God,—does not this virtue demonstrate that it is
as yet rather laboring towards its end than resting in its finished work? For the soul is so
much the less subjected to God as it is less occupied with the thought of God; and the flesh
is so much the less subjected to the spirit as it lusts more vehemently against the spirit. So
long, therefore, as we are beset by this weakness, this plague, this disease, how shall we dare
to say that we are safe? and if not safe, then how can we be already enjoying our final
beatitude? Then that virtue which goes by the name of fortitude is the plainest proof of the
ills of life, for it is these ills which it is compelled to bear patiently. And this holds good, no
matter though the ripest wisdom co-exists with it. And I am at a loss to understand how
the Stoic philosophers can presume to say that these are no ills, though at the same time
they allow the wise man to commit suicide and pass out of this life if they become so grievous
that he cannot or ought not to endure them. But such is the stupid pride of these men who
fancy that the supreme good can be found in this life, and that they can become happy by
their own resources, that their wise man, or at least the man whom they fancifully depict as
such, is always happy, even though he become blind, deaf, dumb, mutilated, racked with
pains, or suffer any conceivable calamity such as may compel him to make away with himself;
and they are not ashamed to call the life that is beset with these evils happy. O happy life,
which seeks the aid of death to end it? If it is happy, let the wise man remain in it; but if
these ills drive him out of it, in what sense is it happy? Or how can they say that these are
not evils which conquer the virtue of fortitude, and force it not only to yield, but so to rave
that it in one breath calls life happy and recommends it to be given up? For who is so blind
as not to see that if it were happy it would not be fled from? And if they say we should flee
from it on account of the infirmities that beset it, why then do they not lower their pride
and acknowledge that it is miserable? Was it, I would ask, fortitude or weakness which
prompted Cato to kill himself? for he would not have done so had he not been too weak to
endure Cæsar’s victory. Where, then, is his fortitude? It has yielded, it has succumbed, it
has been so thoroughly overcome as to abandon, forsake, flee this happy life. Or was it no
longer happy? Then it was miserable. How, then, were these not evils which made life
miserable, and a thing to be escaped from?</p>
<p>And therefore those who admit that these are evils, as the Peripatetics do, and the Old
Academy, the sect which Varro advocates, express a more intelligible doctrine; but theirs
also is a surprising mistake, for they contend that this is a happy life which is beset by these
evils, even though they be so great that he who endures them should commit suicide to escape
them. “Pains and anguish of body,” says Varro, “are evils, and so much the worse in propor-

<pb n="919"/>
tion to their severity; and to escape them you must quit this life.” What life, I pray? This
life, he says, which is oppressed by such evils. Then it is happy in the midst of these very
evils on account of which you say we must quit it? Or do you call it happy because you are
at liberty to escape these evils by death? What, then, if by some secret judgment of God you
were held fast and not permitted to die, nor suffered to live without these evils? In that case,
at least, you would say that such a life was miserable. It is soon relinquished, no doubt but
this does not make it not miserable; for were it eternal, you yourself would pronounce it
miserable. Its brevity, therefore, does not clear it of misery; neither ought it to be called
happiness because it is a brief misery. Certainly there is a mighty force in these evils which
compel a man—according to them even a wise man—to cease to be a man that he may escape
them, though they say, and say truly, that it is as it were the first and strongest demand of
nature that a man cherish himself, and naturally therefore avoid death, and should so stand
his own friend as to wish and vehemently aim at continuing to exist as a living creature, and
subsisting in this union of soul and body. There is a mighty force in these evils to overcome
this natural instinct by which death is by every means and with all a man’s efforts avoided,
and to overcome it so completely that what was avoided is desired, sought after, and if it
cannot in any other way be obtained, is inflicted by the man on himself. There is a mighty
force in these evils which make fortitude a homicide,—if, indeed, that is to be called fortitude
which is so thoroughly overcome by these evils, that it not only cannot preserve by patience
the man whom it undertook to govern and defend, but is itself obliged to kill him. The wise
man, I admit, ought to bear death with patience, but when it is inflicted by another. If, then,
as these men maintain, he is obliged to inflict it on himself, certainly it must be owned that
the ills which compel him to this are not only evils, but intolerable evils. The life, then,
which is either subject to accidents, or environed with evils so considerable and grievous,
could never have been called happy, if the men who give it this name had condescended to
yield to the truth, and to be conquered by valid arguments, when they inquired after the
happy life, as they yield to unhappiness, and are overcome by overwhelming evils, when
they put themselves to death, and if they had not fancied that the supreme good was to be
found in this mortal life; for the very virtues of this life, which are certainly its best and most
useful possessions, are all the more telling proofs of its miseries in proportion as they are
helpful against the violence of its dangers, toils, and woes. For if these are true virtues,—and
such cannot exist save in those who have true piety,—they do not profess to be able to deliver
the men who possess them from all miseries; for true virtues tell no such lies, but they profess
that by the hope of the future world this life, which is miserably involved in the many and
great evils of this world, is happy as it is also safe. For if not yet safe, how could it be happy?
And therefore the Apostle Paul, speaking not of men without prudence, temperance, fortitude,
and justice, but of those whose lives were regulated by true piety, and whose virtues
were therefore true, says, “For we are saved by hope: now hope which is seen is not hope;

<pb n="920"/>
for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then
do we with patience wait for it.”1268 As, therefore, we are saved, so we are made happy by
hope. And as we do not as yet possess a present, but look for a future salvation, so is it with
our happiness, and this “with patience;” for we are encompassed with evils, which we ought
patiently to endure, until we come to the ineffable enjoyment of unmixed good; for there
shall be no longer anything to endure. Salvation, such as it shall be in the world to come,
shall itself be our final happiness. And this happiness these philosophers refuse to believe
in, because they do not see it, and attempt to fabricate for themselves a happiness in this
life, based upon a virtue which is as deceitful as it is proud.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of the Social Life, Which, Though Most Desirable, is Frequently Disturbed
by Many Distresses.</head>
<p>We give a much more unlimited approval to their idea that the life of the wise man must
be social. For how could the city of God (concerning which we are already writing no less
than the nineteenth book of this work) either take a beginning or be developed, or attain
its proper destiny, if the life of the saints were not a social life? But who can enumerate all
the great grievances with which human society abounds in the misery of this mortal state?
Who can weigh them? Hear how one of their comic writers makes one of his characters
express the common feelings of all men in this matter: “I am married; this is one misery.
Children are born to me; they are additional cares.”1269 What shall I say of the miseries of
love which Terence also recounts—“slights, suspicions, quarrels, war to-day, peace tomorrow?”
1270 Is not human life full of such things? Do they not often occur even in honorable
friendships? On all hands we experience these slights, suspicions, quarrels, war, all
of which are undoubted evils; while, on the other hand, peace is a doubtful good, because
we do not know the heart of our friend, and though we did know it to-day, we should be as
ignorant of what it might be to-morrow. Who ought to be, or who are more friendly than
those who live in the same family? And yet who can rely even upon this friendship, seeing
that secret treachery has often broken it up, and produced enmity as bitter as the amity was
sweet, or seemed sweet by the most perfect dissimulation? It is on this account that the
words of Cicero so move the heart of every one, and provoke a sigh: “There are no snares
more dangerous than those which lurk under the guise of duty or the name of relationship.
For the man who is your declared foe you can easily baffle by precaution; but this hidden,
intestine, and domestic danger not merely exists, but overwhelms you before you can foresee
and examine it.”1271 It is also to this that allusion is made by the divine saying, “A man’s
foes are those of his own household,”1272—words which one cannot hear without pain; for
though a man have sufficient fortitude to endure it with equanimity, and sufficient sagacity
to baffle the malice of a pretended friend, yet if he himself is a good man, he cannot but be
greatly pained at the discovery of the perfidy of wicked men, whether they have always been
wicked and merely feigned goodness, or have fallen from a better to a malicious disposition.
If, then, home, the natural refuge from the ills of life, is itself not safe, what shall we say of
the city, which, as it is larger, is so much the more filled with lawsuits civil and criminal,
and is never free from the fear, if sometimes from the actual outbreak, of disturbing and
bloody insurrections and civil wars?</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Of the Error of Human Judgments When the Truth is Hidden.</head>
<p>What shall I say of these judgments which men pronounce on men, and which are necessary
in communities, whatever outward peace they enjoy? Melancholy and lamentable
judgments they are, since the judges are men who cannot discern the consciences of those
at their bar, and are therefore frequently compelled to put innocent witnesses to the torture
to ascertain the truth regarding the crimes of other men. What shall I say of torture applied
to the accused himself? He is tortured to discover whether he is guilty, so that, though innocent,
he suffers most undoubted punishment for crime that is still doubtful, not because
it is proved that he committed it, but because it is not ascertained that he did not commit
it. Thus the ignorance of the judge frequently involves an innocent person in suffering.
And what is still more unendurable—a thing, indeed, to be bewailed, and, if that were possible,
watered with fountains of tears—is this, that when the judge puts the accused to the
question, that he may not unwittingly put an innocent man to death, the result of this lamentable
ignorance is that this very person, whom he tortured that he might not condemn
him if innocent, is condemned to death both tortured and innocent. For if he has chosen,
in obedience to the philosophical instructions to the wise man, to quit this life rather than
endure any longer such tortures, he declares that he has committed the crime which in fact
he has not committed. And when he has been condemned and put to death, the judge is
still in ignorance whether he has put to death an innocent or a guilty person, though he put
the accused to the torture for the very purpose of saving himself from condemning the innocent;
and consequently he has both tortured an innocent man to discover his innocence,
and has put him to death without discovering it. If such darkness shrouds social life, will a
wise judge take his seat on the bench or no? Beyond question he will. For human society,
which he thinks it a wickedness to abandon, constrains him and compels him to this duty.
And he thinks it no wickedness that innocent witnesses are tortured regarding the crimes
of which other men are accused; or that the accused are put to the torture, so that they are
often overcome with anguish, and, though innocent, make false confessions regarding
themselves, and are punished; or that, though they be not condemned to die, they often die
during, or in consequence of, the torture; or that sometimes the accusers, who perhaps have
been prompted by a desire to benefit society by bringing criminals to justice, are themselves
condemned through the ignorance of the judge, because they are unable to prove the truth
of their accusations though they are true, and because the witnesses lie, and the accused
endures the torture without being moved to confession. These numerous and important
evils he does not consider sins; for the wise judge does these things, not with any intention
of doing harm, but because his ignorance compels him, and because human society claims
him as a judge. But though we therefore acquit the judge of malice, we must none the less
condemn human life as miserable. And if he is compelled to torture and punish the innocent
because his office and his ignorance constrain him, is he a happy as well as a guiltless man?

Surely it were proof of more profound considerateness and finer feeling were he to recognize
the misery of these necessities, and shrink from his own implication in that misery; and had
he any piety about him, he would cry to God “From my necessities deliver Thou me.”1273</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Of the Diversity of Languages, by Which the Intercourse of Men is
Prevented; And of the Misery of Wars, Even of Those Called Just.</head>
<p>After the state or city comes the world, the third circle of human society,—the first being
the house, and the second the city. And the world, as it is larger, so it is fuller of dangers,
as the greater sea is the more dangerous. And here, in the first place, man is separated from
man by the difference of languages. For if two men, each ignorant of the other’s language,
meet, and are not compelled to pass, but, on the contrary, to remain in company, dumb
animals, though of different species, would more easily hold intercourse than they, human
beings though they be. For their common nature is no help to friendliness when they are
prevented by diversity of language from conveying their sentiments to one another; so that
a man would more readily hold intercourse with his dog than with a foreigner. But the
imperial city has endeavored to impose on subject nations not only her yoke, but her language,
as a bond of peace, so that interpreters, far from being scarce, are numberless. This
is true; but how many great wars, how much slaughter and bloodshed, have provided this
unity! And though these are past, the end of these miseries has not yet come. For though
there have never been wanting, nor are yet wanting, hostile nations beyond the empire,
against whom wars have been and are waged, yet, supposing there were no such nations,
the very extent of the empire itself has produced wars of a more obnoxious description—social
and civil wars—and with these the whole race has been agitated, either by the actual
conflict or the fear of a renewed outbreak. If I attempted to give an adequate description
of these manifold disasters, these stern and lasting necessities, though I am quite unequal
to the task, what limit could I set? But, say they, the wise man will wage just wars. As if he
would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is a man;
for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all
wars. For it is the wrongdoing of the opposing party which compels the wise man to wage
just wars; and this wrong-doing, even though it gave rise to no war, would still be matter of
grief to man because it is man’s wrong-doing. Let every one, then, who thinks with pain
on all these great evils, so horrible, so ruthless, acknowledge that this is misery. And if any
one either endures or thinks of them without mental pain, this is a more miserable plight
still, for he thinks himself happy because he has lost human feeling.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—That the Friendship of Good Men Cannot Be Securely Rested In, So
Long as the Dangers of This Life Force Us to Be Anxious.</head>
<p>In our present wretched condition we frequently mistake a friend for an enemy, and an
enemy for a friend. And if we escape this pitiable blindness, is not the unfeigned confidence
and mutual love of true and good friends our one solace in human society, filled as it is with
misunderstandings and calamities? And yet the more friends we have, and the more widely
they are scattered, the more numerous are our fears that some portion of the vast masses
of the disasters of life may light upon them. For we are not only anxious lest they suffer
from famine, war, disease, captivity, or the inconceivable horrors of slavery, but we are also
affected with the much more painful dread that their friendship may be changed into perfidy,
malice, and injustice. And when these contingencies actually occur,—as they do the more
frequently the more friends we have, and the more widely they are scattered,—and when
they come to our knowledge, who but the man who has experienced it can tell with what
pangs the heart is torn? We would, in fact, prefer to hear that they were dead, although we
could not without anguish hear of even this. For if their life has solaced us with the charms
of friendship, can it be that their death should affect us with no sadness? He who will have
none of this sadness must, if possible, have no friendly intercourse. Let him interdict or
extinguish friendly affection; let him burst with ruthless insensibility the bonds of every
human relationship; or let him contrive so to use them that no sweetness shall distil into
his spirit. But if this is utterly impossible, how shall we contrive to feel no bitterness in the
death of those whose life has been sweet to us? Hence arises that grief which affects the
tender heart like a wound or a bruise, and which is healed by the application of kindly consolation.
For though the cure is affected all the more easily and rapidly the better condition
the soul is in, we must not on this account suppose that there is nothing at all to heal. Although,
then, our present life is afflicted, sometimes in a milder, sometimes in a more
painful degree, by the death of those very dear to us, and especially of useful public men,
yet we would prefer to hear that such men were dead rather than to hear or perceive that
they had fallen from the faith, or from virtue,—in other words, that they were spiritually
dead. Of this vast material for misery the earth is full, and therefore it is written, “Is not
human life upon earth a trial?”1274 And with the same reference the Lord says, “Woe to
the world because of offenses!”1275 and again, “Because iniquity abounded, the love of many
shall wax cold.”1276 And hence we enjoy some gratification when our good friends die; for
though their death leaves us in sorrow, we have the consolatory assurance that they are

<head>Chapter 9.—Of the Friendship of the Holy Angels, Which Men Cannot Be Sure of
in This Life, Owing to the Deceit of the Demons Who Hold in Bondage the
Worshippers of a Plurality of Gods.</head>
<p>The philosophers who wished us to have the gods for our friends rank the friendship
of the holy angels in the fourth circle of society, advancing now from the three circles of
society on earth to the universe, and embracing heaven itself. And in this friendship we
have indeed no fear that the angels will grieve us by their death or deterioration. But as we
cannot mingle with them as familiarly as with men (which itself is one of the grievances of
this life), and as Satan, as we read,1277 sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light,
to tempt those whom it is necessary to discipline, or just to deceive, there is great need of
God’s mercy to preserve us from making friends of demons in disguise, while we fancy we
have good angels for our friends; for the astuteness and deceitfulness of these wicked spirits
is equalled by their hurtfulness. And is this not a great misery of human life, that we are
involved in such ignorance as, but for God’s mercy, makes us a prey to these demons? And
it is very certain that the philosophers of the godless city, who have maintained that the gods
were their friends, had fallen a prey to the malignant demons who rule that city, and whose
eternal punishment is to be shared by it. For the nature of these beings is sufficiently evinced
by the sacred or rather sacrilegious observances which form their worship, and by the filthy
games in which their crimes are celebrated, and which they themselves originated and exacted
from their worshippers as a fit propitiation.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—The Reward Prepared for the Saints After They Have Endured the
Trial of This Life.</head>
<p>But not even the saints and faithful worshippers of the one true and most high God are
safe from the manifold temptations and deceits of the demons. For in this abode of weakness,
and in these wicked days, this state of anxiety has also its use, stimulating us to seek with
keener longing for that security where peace is complete and unassailable. There we shall
enjoy the gifts of nature, that is to say, all that God the Creator of all natures has bestowed
upon ours,—gifts not only good, but eternal,—not only of the spirit, healed now by wisdom,
but also of the body renewed by the resurrection. There the virtues shall no longer be
struggling against any vice or evil, but shall enjoy the reward of victory, the eternal peace
which no adversary shall disturb. This is the final blessedness, this the ultimate consummation,
the unending end. Here, indeed, we are said to be blessed when we have such peace
as can be enjoyed in a good life; but such blessedness is mere misery compared to that final
felicity. When we mortals possess such peace as this mortal life can afford, virtue, if we are
living rightly, makes a right use of the advantages of this peaceful condition; and when we
have it not, virtue makes a good use even of the evils a man suffers. But this is true virtue,
when it refers all the advantages it makes a good use of, and all that it does in making good
use of good and evil things, and itself also, to that end in which we shall enjoy the best and
greatest peace possible.</p>

<pb n="929"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—Of the Happiness of the Eternal Peace, Which Constitutes the End or
True Perfection of the Saints.</head>
<p>And thus we may say of peace, as we have said of eternal life, that it is the end of our
good; and the rather because the Psalmist says of the city of God, the subject of this laborious
work, “Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion: for He hath strengthened the
bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee; who hath made thy borders
peace.”1278 For when the bars of her gates shall be strengthened, none shall go in or come
out from her; consequently we ought to understand the peace of her borders as that final
peace we are wishing to declare. For even the mystical name of the city itself, that is, Jerusalem,
means, as I have already said, “Vision of Peace.” But as the word peace is employed
in connection with things in this world in which certainly life eternal has no place, we have
preferred to call the end or supreme good of this city life eternal rather than peace. Of this
end the apostle says, “But now, being freed from sin, and become servants to God, ye have
your fruit unto holiness, and the end life eternal.”1279 But, on the other hand, as those who
are not familiar with Scripture may suppose that the life of the wicked is eternal life, either
because of the immortality of the soul, which some of the philosophers even have recognized,
or because of the endless punishment of the wicked, which forms a part of our faith, and
which seems impossible unless the wicked live for ever, it may therefore be advisable, in
order that every one may readily understand what we mean, to say that the end or supreme
good of this city is either peace in eternal life, or eternal life in peace. For peace is a good
so great, that even in this earthly and mortal life there is no word we hear with such pleasure,
nothing we desire with such zest, or find to be more thoroughly gratifying. So that if we
dwell for a little longer on this subject, we shall not, in my opinion, be wearisome to our
readers, who will attend both for the sake of understanding what is the end of this city of
which we speak, and for the sake of the sweetness of peace which is dear to all.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—That Even the Fierceness of War and All the Disquietude of Men Make
Towards This One End of Peace, Which Every Nature Desires.</head>
<p>Whoever gives even moderate attention to human affairs and to our common nature,
will recognize that if there is no man who does not wish to be joyful, neither is there any
one who does not wish to have peace. For even they who make war desire nothing but victory,—
desire, that is to say, to attain to peace with glory. For what else is victory than the
conquest of those who resist us? and when this is done there is peace. It is therefore with
the desire for peace that wars are waged, even by those who take pleasure in exercising their
warlike nature in command and battle. And hence it is obvious that peace is the end sought
for by war. For every man seeks peace by waging war, but no man seeks war by making
peace. For even they who intentionally interrupt the peace in which they are living have no
hatred of peace, but only wish it changed into a peace that suits them better. They do not,
therefore, wish to have no peace, but only one more to their mind. And in the case of sedition,
when men have separated themselves from the community, they yet do not effect what
they wish, unless they maintain some kind of peace with their fellow-conspirators. And
therefore even robbers take care to maintain peace with their comrades, that they may with
greater effect and greater safety invade the peace of other men. And if an individual happen
to be of such unrivalled strength, and to be so jealous of partnership, that he trusts himself
with no comrades, but makes his own plots, and commits depredations and murders on his
own account, yet he maintains some shadow of peace with such persons as he is unable to
kill, and from whom he wishes to conceal his deeds. In his own home, too, he makes it his
aim to be at peace with his wife and children, and any other members of his household; for
unquestionably their prompt obedience to his every look is a source of pleasure to him.
And if this be not rendered, he is angry, he chides and punishes; and even by this storm he
secures the calm peace of his own home, as occasion demands. For he sees that peace cannot
be maintained unless all the members of the same domestic circle be subject to one head,
such as he himself is in his own house. And therefore if a city or nation offered to submit
itself to him, to serve him in the same style as he had made his household serve him, he
would no longer lurk in a brigand’s hiding-places, but lift his head in open day as a king,
though the same coveteousness and wicked ness should remain in him. And thus all men
desire to have peace with their own circle whom they wish to govern as suits themselves.
For even those whom they make war against they wish to make their own, and impose on
them the laws of their own peace.</p>
<p>But let us suppose a man such as poetry and mythology speak of,—a man so insociable
and savage as to be called rather a semi-man than a man.1280 Although, then, his kingdom
was the solitude of a dreary cave, and he himself was so singularly bad-hearted that he was
<note type="footnote">1280 He refers to the giant Cacus.</note>

<pb n="931"/>
named Κακός, which is the Greek word for bad; though he had no wife to soothe him with
endearing talk, no children to play with, no sons to do his bidding, no friend to enliven him
with intercourse, not even his father Vulcan (though in one respect he was happier than his
father, not having begotten a monster like himself); although he gave to no man, but took
as he wished whatever he could, from whomsoever he could, when he could yet in that solitary
den, the floor of which, as Virgil1281 says, was always reeking with recent slaughter,
there was nothing else than peace sought, a peace in which no one should molest him, or
disquiet him with any assault or alarm. With his own body he desired to be at peace, and
he was satisfied only in proportion as he had this peace. For he ruled his members, and
they obeyed him; and for the sake of pacifying his mortal nature, which rebelled when it
needed anything, and of allaying the sedition of hunger which threatened to banish the soul
from the body, he made forays, slew, and devoured, but used the ferocity and savageness
he displayed in these actions only for the preservation of his own life’s peace. So that, had
he been willing to make with other men the same peace which he made with himself in his
own cave, he would neither have been called bad, nor a monster, nor a semi-man. Or if the
appearance of his body and his vomiting smoky fires frightened men from having any
dealings with him, perhaps his fierce ways arose not from a desire to do mischief, but from
the necessity of finding a living. But he may have had no existence, or, at least, he was not
such as the poets fancifully describe him, for they had to exalt Hercules, and did so at the
expense of Cacus. It is better, then, to believe that such a man or semi-man never existed,
and that this, in common with many other fancies of the poets, is mere fiction. For the most
savage animals (and he is said to have been almost a wild beast) encompass their own species
with a ring of protecting peace. They cohabit, beget, produce, suckle, and bring up their
young, though very many of them are not gregarious, but solitary,—not like sheep, deer,
pigeons, starlings, bees, but such as lions, foxes, eagles, bats. For what tigress does not gently
purr over her cubs, and lay aside her ferocity to fondle them? What kite, solitary as he is
when circling over his prey, does not seek a mate, build a nest, hatch the eggs, bring up the
young birds, and maintain with the mother of his family as peaceful a domestic alliance as
he can? How much more powerfully do the laws of man’s nature move him to hold fellowship
and maintain peace with all men so far as in him lies, since even wicked men wage war to
maintain the peace of their own circle, and wish that, if possible, all men belonged to them,
that all men and things might serve but one head, and might, either through love or fear,
yield themselves to peace with him! It is thus that pride in its perversity apes God. It abhors
equality with other men under Him; but, instead of His rule, it seeks to impose a rule of its
own upon its equals. It abhors, that is to say, the just peace of God, and loves its own unjust
<note type="footnote">1281 Æneid, viii. 195.</note>

<pb n="932"/>
peace; but it cannot help loving peace of one kind or other. For there is no vice so clean
contrary to nature that it obliterates even the faintest traces of nature.</p>
<p>He, then, who prefers what is right to what is wrong, and what is well-ordered to what
is perverted, sees that the peace of unjust men is not worthy to be called peace in comparison
with the peace of the just. And yet even what is perverted must of necessity be in harmony
with, and in dependence on, and in some part of the order of things, for otherwise it would
have no existence at all. Suppose a man hangs with his head downwards, this is certainly a
perverted attitude of body and arrangement of its members; for that which nature requires
to be above is beneath, and vice versâ. This perversity disturbs the peace of the body, and
is therefore painful. Nevertheless the spirit is at peace with its body, and labors for its preservation,
and hence the suffering; but if it is banished from the body by its pains, then, so
long as the bodily framework holds together, there is in the remains a kind of peace among
the members, and hence the body remains suspended. And inasmuch as the earthly body
tends towards the earth, and rests on the bond by which it is suspended, it tends thus to its
natural peace, and the voice of its own weight demands a place for it to rest; and though
now lifeless and without feeling, it does not fall from the peace that is natural to its place in
creation, whether it already has it, or is tending towards it. For if you apply embalming
preparations to prevent the bodily frame from mouldering and dissolving, a kind of peace
still unites part to part, and keeps the whole body in a suitable place on the earth,—in other
words, in a place that is at peace with the body. If, on the other hand, the body receive no
such care, but be left to the natural course, it is disturbed by exhalations that do not harmonize
with one another, and that offend our senses; for it is this which is perceived in putrefaction
until it is assimilated to the elements of the world, and particle by particle enters into
peace with them. Yet throughout this process the laws of the most high Creator and Governor
are strictly observed, for it is by Him the peace of the universe is administered. For although
minute animals are produced from the carcass of a larger animal, all these little atoms, by
the law of the same Creator, serve the animals they belong to in peace. And although the
flesh of dead animals be eaten by others, no matter where it be carried, nor what it be brought
into contact with, nor what it be converted and changed into, it still is ruled by the same
laws which pervade all things for the conservation of every mortal race, and which bring
things that fit one another into harmony.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Of the Universal Peace Which the Law of Nature Preserves Through
All Disturbances, and by Which Every One Reaches His Desert in a Way Regulated
by the Just Judge.</head>
<p>The peace of the body then consists in the duly proportioned arrangement of its parts.
The peace of the irrational soul is the harmonious repose of the appetites, and that of the
rational soul the harmony of knowledge and action. The peace of body and soul is the wellordered
and harmonious life and health of the living creature. Peace between man and God
is the well-ordered obedience of faith to eternal law. Peace between man and man is wellordered
concord. Domestic peace is the well-ordered concord between those of the family
who rule and those who obey. Civil peace is a similar concord among the citizens. The
peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God, and
of one another in God. The peace of all things is the tranquillity of order. Order is the distribution
which allots things equal and unequal, each to its own place. And hence, though
the miserable, in so far as they are such, do certainly not enjoy peace, but are severed from
that tranquillity of order in which there is no disturbance, nevertheless, inasmuch as they
are deservedly and justly miserable, they are by their very misery connected with order.
They are not, indeed, conjoined with the blessed, but they are disjoined from them by the
law of order. And though they are disquieted, their circumstances are notwithstanding adjusted
to them, and consequently they have some tranquillity of order, and therefore some
peace. But they are wretched because, although not wholly miserable, they are not in that
place where any mixture of misery is impossible. They would, however, be more wretched
if they had not that peace which arises from being in harmony with the natural order of
things. When they suffer, their peace is in so far disturbed; but their peace continues in so
far as they do not suffer, and in so far as their nature continues to exist. As, then, there may
be life without pain, while there cannot be pain without some kind of life, so there may be
peace without war, but there cannot be war without some kind of peace, because war supposes
the existence of some natures to wage it, and these natures cannot exist without peace of
one kind or other.</p>
<p>And therefore there is a nature in which evil does not or even cannot exist; but there
cannot be a nature in which there is no good. Hence not even the nature of the devil himself
is evil, in so far as it is nature, but it was made evil by being perverted. Thus he did not abide
in the truth,1282 but could not escape the judgment of the Truth; he did not abide in the
tranquillity of order, but did not therefore escape the power of the Ordainer. The good
imparted by God to his nature did not screen him from the justice of God by which order
was preserved in his punishment; neither did God punish the good which He had created,
but the evil which the devil had committed. God did not take back all He had imparted to

his nature, but something He took and something He left, that there might remain enough
to be sensible of the loss of what was taken. And this very sensibility to pain is evidence of
the good which has been taken away and the good which has been left. For, were nothing
good left, there could be no pain on account of the good which had been lost. For he who
sins is still worse if he rejoices in his loss of righteousness. But he who is in pain, if he derives
no benefit from it, mourns at least the loss of health. And as righteousness and health are
both good things, and as the loss of any good thing is matter of grief, not of joy,—if, at least,
there is no compensation, as spiritual righteousness may compensate for the loss of bodily
health,—certainly it is more suitable for a wicked man to grieve in punishment than to rejoice
in his fault. As, then, the joy of a sinner who has abandoned what is good is evidence of a
bad will, so his grief for the good he has lost when he is punished is evidence of a good
nature. For he who laments the peace his nature has lost is stirred to do so by some relics
of peace which make his nature friendly to itself. And it is very just that in the final punishment
the wicked and godless should in anguish bewail the loss of the natural advantages
they enjoyed, and should perceive that they were most justly taken from them by that God
whose benign liberality they had despised. God, then, the most wise Creator and most just
Ordainer of all natures, who placed the human race upon earth as its greatest ornament,
imparted to men some good things adapted to this life, to wit, temporal peace, such as we
can enjoy in this life from health and safety and human fellowship, and all things needful
for the preservation and recovery of this peace, such as the objects which are accommodated
to our outward senses, light, night, the air, and waters suitable for us, and everything the
body requires to sustain, shelter, heal, or beautify it: and all under this most equitable condition,
that every man who made a good use of these advantages suited to the peace of this
mortal condition, should receive ampler and better blessings, namely, the peace of immortality,
accompanied by glory and honor in an endless life made fit for the enjoyment of God
and of one another in God; but that he who used the present blessings badly should both
lose them and should not receive the others.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Order and Law Which Obtain in Heaven and Earth, Whereby
It Comes to Pass that Human Society Is Served by Those Who Rule It.</head>
<p>The whole use, then, of things temporal has a reference to this result of earthly peace
in the earthly community, while in the city of God it is connected with eternal peace. And
therefore, if we were irrational animals, we should desire nothing beyond the proper arrangement
of the parts of the body and the satisfaction of the appetites,—nothing, therefore, but
bodily comfort and abundance of pleasures, that the peace of the body might contribute to
the peace of the soul. For if bodily peace be awanting, a bar is put to the peace even of the
irrational soul, since it cannot obtain the gratification of its appetites. And these two together
help out the mutual peace of soul and body, the peace of harmonious life and health. For
as animals, by shunning pain, show that they love bodily peace, and, by pursuing pleasure
to gratify their appetites, show that they love peace of soul, so their shrinking from death is
a sufficient indication of their intense love of that peace which binds soul and body in close
alliance. But, as man has a rational soul, he subordinates all this which he has in common
with the beasts to the peace of his rational soul, that his intellect may have free play and may
regulate his actions, and that he may thus enjoy the well-ordered harmony of knowledge
and action which constitutes, as we have said, the peace of the rational soul. And for this
purpose he must desire to be neither molested by pain, nor disturbed by desire, nor extinguished
by death, that he may arrive at some useful knowledge by which he may regulate
his life and manners. But, owing to the liability of the human mind to fall into mistakes,
this very pursuit of knowledge may be a snare to him unless he has a divine Master, whom
he may obey without misgiving, and who may at the same time give him such help as to
preserve his own freedom. And because, so long as he is in this mortal body, he is a stranger
to God, he walks by faith, not by sight; and he therefore refers all peace, bodily or spiritual
or both, to that peace which mortal man has with the immortal God, so that he exhibits the
well-ordered obedience of faith to eternal law. But as this divine Master inculcates two
precepts,—the love of God and the love of our neighbor,—and as in these precepts a man
finds three things he has to love,—God, himself, and his neighbor,—and that he who loves
God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavor to get his neighbor to love God,
since he is ordered to love his neighbor as himself. He ought to make this endeavor in behalf
of his wife, his children, his household, all within his reach, even as he would wish his
neighbor to do the same for him if he needed it; and consequently he will be at peace, or in
well-ordered concord, with all men, as far as in him lies. And this is the order of this concord,
that a man, in the first place, injure no one, and, in the second, do good to every one he can
reach. Primarily, therefore, his own household are his care, for the law of nature and of
society gives him readier access to them and greater opportunity of serving them. And
hence the apostle says, “Now, if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his

<pb n="936"/>
own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.”1283 This is the origin of
domestic peace, or the well-ordered concord of those in the family who rule and those who
obey. For they who care for the rest rule,—the husband the wife, the parents the children,
the masters the servants; and they who are cared for obey,—the women their husbands, the
children their parents, the servants their masters. But in the family of the just man who
lives by faith and is as yet a pilgrim journeying on to the celestial city, even those who rule
serve those whom they seem to command; for they rule not from a love of power, but from
a sense of the duty they owe to others—not because they are proud of authority, but because
they love mercy.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Of the Liberty Proper to Man’s Nature, and the Servitude Introduced
by Sin,—A Servitude in Which the Man Whose Will is Wicked is the Slave of
His Own Lust, Though He is Free So Far as Regards Other Men.</head>
<p>This is prescribed by the order of nature: it is thus that God has created man. For “let
them,” He says, “have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over every creeping thing which creepeth on the earth.”1284 He did not intend that His rational
creature, who was made in His image, should have dominion over anything but the
irrational creation,—not man over man, but man over the beasts. And hence the righteous
men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle rather than kings of men, God intending
thus to teach us what the relative position of the creatures is, and what the desert of sin;
for it is with justice, we believe, that the condition of slavery is the result of sin. And this is
why we do not find the word “slave” in any part of Scripture until righteous Noah branded
the sin of his son with this name. It is a name, therefore, introduced by sin and not by
nature. The origin of the Latin word for slave is supposed to be found in the circumstance
that those who by the law of war were liable to be killed were sometimes preserved by their
victors, and were hence called servants.1285 And these circumstances could never have
arisen save through sin. For even when we wage a just war, our adversaries must be sinning;
and every victory, even though gained by wicked men, is a result of the first judgment of
God, who humbles the vanquished either for the sake of removing or of punishing their
sins. Witness that man of God, Daniel, who, when he was in captivity, confessed to God
his own sins and the sins of his people, and declares with pious grief that these were the
cause of the captivity.1286 The prime cause, then, of slavery is sin, which brings man under
the dominion of his fellow,—that which does not happen save by the judgment of God, with
whom is no unrighteousness, and who knows how to award fit punishments to every variety
of offence. But our Master in heaven says, “Every one who doeth sin is the servant of
sin.”1287 And thus there are many wicked masters who have religious men as their slaves,
and who are yet themselves in bondage; “for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage.”1288 And beyond question it is a happier thing to be the slave of a man
than of a lust; for even this very lust of ruling, to mention no others, lays waste men’s hearts
with the most ruthless dominion. Moreover, when men are subjected to one another in a
peaceful order, the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position

does harm to the master. But by nature, as God first created us, no one is the slave either
of man or of sin. This servitude is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins
the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance; for if nothing had been
done in violation of that law, there would have been nothing to restrain by penal servitude.
And therefore the apostle admonishes slaves to be subject to their masters, and to serve
them heartily and with good-will, so that, if they cannot be freed by their masters, they may
themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful
love, until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be
brought to nothing, and God be all in all.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Of Equitable Rule.</head>
<p>And therefore, although our righteous fathers1289 had slaves, and administered their
domestic affairs so as to distinguish between the condition of slaves and the heirship of sons
in regard to the blessings of this life, yet in regard to the worship of God, in whom we hope
for eternal blessings, they took an equally loving oversight of all the members of their
household. And this is so much in accordance with the natural order, that the head of the
household was called paterfamilias; and this name has been so generally accepted, that even
those whose rule is unrighteous are glad to apply it to themselves. But those who are true
fathers of their households desire and endeavor that all the members of their household,
equally with their own children, should worship and win God, and should come to that
heavenly home in which the duty of ruling men is no longer necessary, because the duty of
caring for their everlasting happiness has also ceased; but, until they reach that home, masters
ought to feel their position of authority a greater burden than servants their service. And
if any member of the family interrupts the domestic peace by disobedience, he is corrected
either by word or blow, or some kind of just and legitimate punishment, such as society
permits, that he may himself be the better for it, and be readjusted to the family harmony
from which he had dislocated himself. For as it is not benevolent to give a man help at the
expense of some greater benefit he might receive, so it is not innocent to spare a man at the
risk of his falling into graver sin. To be innocent, we must not only do harm to no man,
but also restrain him from sin or punish his sin, so that either the man himself who is punished
may profit by his experience, or others be warned by his example. Since, then, the
house ought to be the beginning or element of the city, and every beginning bears reference
to some end of its own kind, and every element to the integrity of the whole of which it is
an element, it follows plainly enough that domestic peace has a relation to civic peace,—in
other words, that the well-ordered concord of domestic obedience and domestic rule has a
relation to the well-ordered concord of civic obedience and civic rule. And therefore it follows,
further, that the father of the family ought to frame his domestic rule in accordance
with the law of the city, so that the household may be in harmony with the civic order.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—What Produces Peace, and What Discord, Between the Heavenly and
Earthly Cities.</head>
<p>But the families which do not live by faith seek their peace in the earthly advantages of
this life; while the families which live by faith look for those eternal blessings which are
promised, and use as pilgrims such advantages of time and of earth as do not fascinate and
divert them from God, but rather aid them to endure with greater ease, and to keep down
the number of those burdens of the corruptible body which weigh upon the soul. Thus the
things necessary for this mortal life are used by both kinds of men and families alike, but
each has its own peculiar and widely different aim in using them. The earthly city, which
does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace, and the end it proposes, in the well-ordered
concord of civic obedience and rule, is the combination of men’s wills to attain the things
which are helpful to this life. The heavenly city, or rather the part of it which sojourns on
earth and lives by faith, makes use of this peace only because it must, until this mortal condition
which necessitates it shall pass away. Consequently, so long as it lives like a captive
and a stranger in the earthly city, though it has already received the promise of redemption,
and the gift of the Spirit as the earnest of it, it makes no scruple to obey the laws of the earthly
city, whereby the things necessary for the maintenance of this mortal life are administered;
and thus, as this life is common to both cities, so there is a harmony between them in regard
to what belongs to it. But, as the earthly city has had some philosophers whose doctrine is
condemned by the divine teaching, and who, being deceived either by their own conjectures
or by demons, supposed that many gods must be invited to take an interest in human affairs,
and assigned to each a separate function and a separate department,—to one the body, to
another the soul; and in the body itself, to one the head, to another the neck, and each of
the other members to one of the gods; and in like manner, in the soul, to one god the natural
capacity was assigned, to another education, to another anger, to another lust; and so the
various affairs of life were assigned,—cattle to one, corn to another, wine to another, oil to
another, the woods to another, money to another, navigation to another, wars and victories
to another, marriages to another, births and fecundity to another, and other things to other
gods: and as the celestial city, on the other hand, knew that one God only was to be worshipped,
and that to Him alone was due that service which the Greeks call λατρεία, and
which can be given only to a god, it has come to pass that the two cities could not have
common laws of religion, and that the heavenly city has been compelled in this matter to
dissent, and to become obnoxious to those who think differently, and to stand the brunt of
their anger and hatred and persecutions, except in so far as the minds of their enemies have
been alarmed by the multitude of the Christians and quelled by the manifest protection of
God accorded to them. This heavenly city, then, while it sojourns on earth, calls citizens
out of all nations, and gathers together a society of pilgrims of all languages, not scrupling

<pb n="941"/>
about diversities in the manners, laws, and institutions whereby earthly peace is secured
and maintained, but recognizing that, however various these are, they all tend to one and
the same end of earthly peace. It therefore is so far from rescinding and abolishing these
diversities, that it even preserves and adopts them, so long only as no hindrance to the
worship of the one supreme and true God is thus introduced. Even the heavenly city,
therefore, while in its state of pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as it
can without injuring faith and godliness, desires and maintains a common agreement among
men regarding the acquisition of the necessaries of life, and makes this earthly peace bear
upon the peace of heaven; for this alone can be truly called and esteemed the peace of the
reasonable creatures, consisting as it does in the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment
of God and of one another in God. When we shall have reached that peace, this mortal life
shall give place to one that is eternal, and our body shall be no more this animal body which
by its corruption weighs down the soul, but a spiritual body feeling no want, and in all its
members subjected to the will. In its pilgrim state the heavenly city possesses this peace by
faith; and by this faith it lives righteously when it refers to the attainment of that peace every
good action towards God and man; for the life of the city is a social life.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—How Different the Uncertainty of the New Academy is from the Certainty
of the Christian Faith.</head>
<p>As regards the uncertainty about everything which Varro alleges to be the differentiating
characteristic of the New Academy, the city of God thoroughly detests such doubt as madness.
Regarding matters which it apprehends by the mind and reason it has most absolute
certainty, although its knowledge is limited because of the corruptible body pressing down
the mind, for, as the apostle says, “We know in part.”1290 It believes also the evidence of
the senses which the mind uses by aid of the body; for [if one who trusts his senses is
sometimes deceived], he is more wretchedly deceived who fancies he should never trust
them. It believes also the Holy Scriptures, old and new, which we call canonical, and which
are the source of the faith by which the just lives1291 and by which we walk without doubting
whilst we are absent from the Lord.1292 So long as this faith remains inviolate and firm, we
may without blame entertain doubts regarding some things which we have neither perceived
by sense nor by reason, and which have not been revealed to us by the canonical Scriptures,
nor come to our knowledge through witnesses whom it is absurd to disbelieve.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Of the Dress and Habits of the Christian People.</head>
<p>It is a matter of no moment in the city of God whether he who adopts the faith that
brings men to God adopts it in one dress and manner of life or another, so long only as he
lives in conformity with the commandments of God. And hence, when philosophers
themselves become Christians, they are compelled, indeed, to abandon their erroneous
doctrines, but not their dress and mode of living, which are no obstacle to religion. So that
we make no account of that distinction of sects which Varro adduced in connection with
the Cynic school, provided always nothing indecent or self-indulgent is retained. As to
these three modes of life, the contemplative, the active, and the composite, although, so long
as a man’s faith is preserved, he may choose any of them without detriment to his eternal
interests, yet he must never overlook the claims of truth and duty. No man has a right to
lead such a life of contemplation as to forget in his own ease the service due to his neighbor;
nor has any man a right to be so immersed in active life as to neglect the contemplation of
God. The charm of leisure must not be indolent vacancy of mind, but the investigation or
discovery of truth, that thus every man may make solid attainments without grudging that
others do the same. And, in active life, it is not the honors or power of this life we should
covet, since all things under the sun are vanity, but we should aim at using our position and
influence, if these have been honorably attained, for the welfare of those who are under us,
in the way we have already explained.1293 It is to this the apostle refers when he says, “He
that desireth the episcopate desireth a good work.”1294 He wished to show that the episcopate
is the title of a work, not of an honor. It is a Greek word, and signifies that he who governs
superintends or takes care of those whom he governs: for ἐπί means over, and σκοπεῖν, to
see; therefore ἐπισκοπεῖν means “to oversee.”1295 So that he who loves to govern rather
than to do good is no bishop. Accordingly no one is prohibited from the search after truth,
for in this leisure may most laudably be spent; but it is unseemly to covet the high position
requisite for governing the people, even though that position be held and that government
be administered in a seemly manner. And therefore holy leisure is longed for by the love
of truth; but it is the necessity of love to undertake requisite business. If no one imposes
this burden upon us, we are free to sift and contemplate truth; but if it be laid upon us, we
are necessitated for love’s sake to undertake it. And yet not even in this case are we obliged
wholly to relinquish the sweets of contemplation; for were these to be withdrawn, the burden
might prove more than we could bear.</p>

called even now blessed, though not in reality so much as in hope. But the actual possession
of the happiness of this life, without the hope of what is beyond, is but a false happiness and
profound misery. For the true blessings of the soul are not now enjoyed; for that is no true

<head>Chapter 21.—Whether There Ever Was a Roman Republic Answering to the
Definitions of Scipio in Cicero’s Dialogue.</head>
<p>This, then, is the place where I should fulfill the promise gave in the second book of this
work,1296 and explain, as briefly and clearly as possible, that if we are to accept the definitions
laid down by Scipio in Cicero’s De Republica, there never was a Roman republic; for he
briefly defines a republic as the weal of the people. And if this definition be true, there
never was a Roman republic, for the people’s weal was never attained among the Romans.
For the people, according to his definition, is an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment
of right and by a community of interests. And what he means by a common
acknowledgment of right he explains at large, showing that a republic cannot be administered
without justice. Where, therefore, there is no true justice there can be no right. For that
which is done by right is justly done, and what is unjustly done cannot be done by right.
For the unjust inventions of men are neither to be considered nor spoken of as rights; for
even they themselves say that right is that which flows from the fountain of justice, and deny
the definition which is commonly given by those who misconceive the matter, that right is
that which is useful to the stronger party. Thus, where there is not true justice there can be
no assemblage of men associated by a common acknowledgment of right, and therefore
there can be no people, as defined by Scipio or Cicero; and if no people, then no weal of the
people, but only of some promiscuous multitude unworthy of the name of people. Consequently,
if the republic is the weal of the people, and there is no people if it be not associated
by a common acknowledgment of right, and if there is no right where there is no justice,
then most certainly it follows that there is no republic where there is no justice. Further,
justice is that virtue which gives every one his due. Where, then, is the justice of man, when
he deserts the true God and yields himself to impure demons? Is this to give every one his
due? Or is he who keeps back a piece of ground from the purchaser, and gives it to a man
who has no right to it, unjust, while he who keeps back himself from the God who made
him, and serves wicked spirits, is just?</p>
<p>This same book, De Republica, advocates the cause of justice against injustice with great
force and keenness. The pleading for injustice against justice was first heard, and it was
asserted that without injustice a republic could neither increase nor even subsist, for it was
laid down as an absolutely unassailable position that it is unjust for some men to rule and
some to serve; and yet the imperial city to which the republic belongs cannot rule her
provinces without having recourse to this injustice. It was replied in behalf of justice, that
this ruling of the provinces is just, because servitude may be advantageous to the provincials,
and is so when rightly administered,—that is to say, when lawless men are prevented from
doing harm. And further, as they became worse and worse so long as they were free, they
<note type="footnote">1296 Ch. 21.</note>

<pb n="946"/>
will improve by subjection. To confirm this reasoning, there is added an eminent example
drawn from nature: for “why,” it is asked, “does God rule man, the soul the body, the reason
the passions and other vicious parts of the soul?” This example leaves no doubt that, to
some, servitude is useful; and, indeed, to serve God is useful to all. And it is when the soul
serves God that it exercises a right control over the body; and in the soul itself the reason
must be subject to God if it is to govern as it ought the passions and other vices. Hence,
when a man does not serve God, what justice can we ascribe to him, since in this case his
soul cannot exercise a just control over the body, nor his reason over his vices? And if there
is no justice in such an individual, certainly there can be none in a community composed
of such persons. Here, therefore, there is not that common acknowledgment of right which
makes an assemblage of men a people whose affairs we call a republic. And why need I
speak of the advantageousness, the common participation in which, according to the
definition, makes a people? For although, if you choose to regard the matter attentively,
you will see that there is nothing advantageous to those who live godlessly, as every one lives
who does not serve God but demons, whose wickedness you may measure by their desire
to receive the worship of men though they are most impure spirits, yet what I have said of
the common acknowledgment of right is enough to demonstrate that, according to the
above definition, there can be no people, and therefore no republic, where there is no justice.
For if they assert that in their republic the Romans did not serve unclean spirits, but good
and holy gods, must we therefore again reply to this evasion, though already we have said
enough, and more than enough, to expose it? He must be an uncommonly stupid, or a
shamelessly contentious person, who has read through the foregoing books to this point,
and can yet question whether the Romans served wicked and impure demons. But, not to
speak of their character, it is written in the law of the true God, “He that sacrificeth unto
any god save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.”1297 He, therefore, who
uttered so menacing a commandment decreed that no worship should be given either to
good or bad gods.</p>

Whom Alone Sacrifice Ought to Be Paid.</head>
<p>But it may be replied, Who is this God, or what proof is there that He alone is worthy
to receive sacrifice from the Romans? One must be very blind to be still asking who this
God is. He is the God whose prophets predicted the things we see accomplished. He is the
God from whom Abraham received the assurance, “In thy seed shall all nations be
blessed.”1298 That this was fulfilled in Christ, who according to the flesh sprang from that
seed, is recognized, whether they will or no, even by those who have continued to be the
enemies of this name. He is the God whose divine Spirit spake by the men whose predictions
I cited in the preceding books, and which are fulfilled in the Church which has extended
over all the world. This is the God whom Varro, the most learned of the Romans, supposed
to be Jupiter, though he knows not what he says; yet I think it right to note the circumstance
that a man of such learning was unable to suppose that this God had no existence or was
contemptible, but believed Him to be the same as the supreme God. In fine, He is the God
whom Porphyry, the most learned of the philosophers, though the bitterest enemy of the
Christians, confesses to be a great God, even according to the oracles of those whom he esteems

the responses which he pretends were uttered by the gods concerning divine things, he
says—I give his own words as they have been translated from the Greek: “To one who inquired
what god he should propitiate in order to recall his wife from Christianity, Apollo
replied in the following verses.” Then the following words are given as those of Apollo:
“You will probably find it easier to write lasting characters on the water, or lightly fly like a
bird through the air, than to restore right feeling in your impious wife once she has polluted
herself. Let her remain as she pleases in her foolish deception, and sing false laments to her
dead God, who was condemned by right-minded judges, and perished ignominiously by a
violent death.” Then after these verses of Apollo (which we have given in a Latin version
that does not preserve the metrical form), he goes on to say: “In these verses Apollo exposed
the incurable corruption of the Christians, saying that the Jews, rather than the Christians,
recognized God.” See how he misrepresents Christ, giving the Jews the preference to the
Christians in the recognition of God. This was his explanation of Apollo’s verses, in which
he says that Christ was put to death by right-minded or just judges,—in other words, that
He deserved to die. I leave the responsibility of this oracle regarding Christ on the lying
interpreter of Apollo, or on this philosopher who believed it or possibly himself invented
it; as to its agreement with Porphyry’s opinions or with other oracles, we shall in a little have
something to say. In this passage, however, he says that the Jews, as the interpreters of God,
judged justly in pronouncing Christ to be worthy of the most shameful death. He should
have listened, then, to this God of the Jews to whom he bears this testimony, when that God
says, “He that sacrificeth to any other god save to the Lord alone shall be utterly destroyed.”
But let us come to still plainer expressions, and hear how great a God Porphyry thinks the
God of the Jews is. Apollo, he says, when asked whether word, i.e., reason, or law is the
better thing, replied in the following verses. Then he gives the verses of Apollo, from which
I select the following as sufficient: “God, the Generator, and the King prior to all things,
before whom heaven and earth, and the sea, and the hidden places of hell tremble, and the
deities themselves are afraid, for their law is the Father whom the holy Hebrews honor.”
In this oracle of his god Apollo, Porphyry avowed that the God of the Hebrews is so great
that the deities themselves are afraid before Him. I am surprised, therefore, that when God
said, He that sacrificeth to other gods shall be utterly destroyed, Porphyry himself was not
afraid lest he should be destroyed for sacrificing to other gods.</p>
<p>This philosopher, however, has also some good to say of Christ, oblivious, as it were,
of that contumely of his of which we have just been speaking; or as if his gods spoke evil of
Christ only while asleep, and recognized Him to be good, and gave Him His deserved praise,
when they awoke. For, as if he were about to proclaim some marvellous thing passing belief,

<pb n="949"/>
he says, “What we are going to say will certainly take some by surprise. For the gods have
declared that Christ was very pious, and has become immortal, and that they cherish his
memory: that the Christians, however, are polluted, contaminated, and involved in error.
And many other such things,” he says, “do the gods say against the Christians.” Then he
gives specimens of the accusations made, as he says, by the gods against them, and then goes
on: “But to some who asked Hecate whether Christ were a God, she replied, You know the
condition of the disembodied immortal soul, and that if it has been severed from wisdom
it always errs. The soul you refer to is that of a man foremost in piety: they worship it because
they mistake the truth.” To this so-called oracular response he adds the following words of
his own: “Of this very pious man, then, Hecate said that the soul, like the souls of other
good men, was after death dowered with immortality, and that the Christians through ignorance
worship it. And to those who ask why he was condemned to die, the oracle of the
goddess replied, The body, indeed, is always exposed to torments, but the souls of the pious
abide in heaven. And the soul you inquire about has been the fatal cause of error to other
souls which were not fated to receive the gifts of the gods, and to have the knowledge of
immortal Jove. Such souls are therefore hated by the gods; for they who were fated not to
receive the gifts of the gods, and not to know God, were fated to be involved in error by
means of him you speak of. He himself, however, was good, and heaven has been opened
to him as to other good men. You are not, then, to speak evil of him, but to pity the folly
of men: and through him men’s danger is imminent.”</p>
<p>Who is so foolish as not to see that these oracles were either composed by a clever man
with a strong animus against the Christians, or were uttered as responses by impure demons
with a similar design,—that is to say, in order that their praise of Christ may win credence
for their vituperation of Christians; and that thus they may, if possible, close the way of
eternal salvation, which is identical with Christianity? For they believe that they are by no
means counter working their own hurtful craft by promoting belief in Christ, so long as
their calumniation of Christians is also accepted; for they thus secure that even the man
who thinks well of Christ declines to become a Christian, and is therefore not delivered
from their own rule by the Christ he praises. Besides, their praise of Christ is so contrived
that whosoever believes in Him as thus represented will not be a true Christian but a
Photinian heretic, recognizing only the humanity, and not also the divinity of Christ, and
will thus be precluded from salvation and from deliverance out of the meshes of these devilish
lies. For our part, we are no better pleased with Hecate’s praises of Christ than with
Apollo’s calumniation of Him. Apollo says that Christ was put to death by right-minded
judges, implying that He was unrighteous. Hecate says that He was a most pious man, but
no more. The intention of both is the same, to prevent men from becoming Christians,
because if this be secured, men shall never be rescued from their power. But it is incumbent
on our philosopher, or rather on those who believe in these pretended oracles against the

<pb n="950"/>
Christians, first of all, if they can, to bring Apollo and Hecate to the same mind regarding
Christ, so that either both may condemn or both praise Him. And even if they succeeded
in this, we for our part would notwithstanding repudiate the testimony of demons, whether
favorable or adverse to Christ. But when our adversaries find a god and goddess of their
own at variance about Christ the one praising, the other vituperating Him, they can certainly
give no credence, if they have any judgment, to mere men who blaspheme the Christians.</p>
<p>When Porphyry or Hecate praises Christ, and adds that He gave Himself to the Christians
as a fatal gift, that they might be involved in error, he exposes, as he thinks, the causes of
this error. But before I cite his words to that purpose, I would ask, If Christ did thus give
Himself to the Christians to involve them in error, did He do so willingly, or against His
will? If willingly, how is He righteous? If against His will, how is He blessed? However, let
us hear the causes of this error. “There are,” he says,” in a certain place very small earthly
spirits, subject to the power of evil demons. The wise men of the Hebrews, among whom
was this Jesus, as you have heard from the oracles of Apollo cited above, turned religious
persons from these very wicked demons and minor spirits, and taught them rather to worship
the celestial gods, and especially to adore God the Father. This,” he said, “the gods enjoin;
and we have already shown how they admonish the soul to turn to God, and command it
to worship Him. But the ignorant and the ungodly, who are not destined to receive favors
from the gods, nor to know the immortal Jupiter, not listening to the gods and their messages,
have turned away from all gods, and have not only refused to hate, but have venerated the
prohibited demons. Professing to worship God, they refuse to do those things by which
alone God is worshipped. For God, indeed, being the Father of all, is in need of nothing;
but for us it is good to adore Him by means of justice, chastity, and other virtues, and thus
to make life itself a prayer to Him, by inquiring into and imitating His nature. For inquiry,”
says he, “purifies and imitation deifies us, by moving us nearer to Him.” He is right in so
far as he proclaims God the Father, and the conduct by which we should worship Him. Of
such precepts the prophetic books of the Hebrews are full, when they praise or blame the
life of the saints. But in speaking of the Christians he is in error, and caluminates them as
much as is desired by the demons whom he takes for gods, as if it were difficult for any man
to recollect the disgraceful and shameful actions which used to be done in the theatres and
temples to please the gods, and to compare with these things what is heard in our churches,
and what is offered to the true God, and from this comparison to conclude where character
is edified, and where it is ruined. But who but a diabolical spirit has told or suggested to
this man so manifest and vain a lie, as that the Christians reverenced rather than hated the
demons, whose worship the Hebrews prohibited? But that God, whom the Hebrew sages
worshipped, forbids sacrifice to be offered even to the holy angels of heaven and divine
powers, whom we, in this our pilgrimage, venerate and love as our most blessed fellow-citizens.
For in the law which God gave to His Hebrew people He utters this menace, as in a

<pb n="951"/>
voice of thunder: “He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be
utterly destroyed.”1299 And that no one might suppose that this prohibition extends only
to the very wicked demons and earthly spirits, whom this philosopher calls very small and
inferior,—for even these are in the Scripture called gods, not of the Hebrews, but of the nations,
as the Septuagint translators have shown in the psalm where it is said, “For all the
gods of the nations are demons,”1300—that no one might suppose, I say, that sacrifice to
these demons was prohibited, but that sacrifice might be offered to all or some of the celestials,
it was immediately added, “save unto the Lord alone.”1301 The God of the Hebrews,
then, to whom this renowned philosopher bears this signal testimony, gave to His Hebrew
people a law, composed in the Hebrew language, and not obscure and unknown, but published
now in every nation, and in this law it is written, “He that sacrificeth unto any god,
save unto the Lord alone, he shall be utterly destroyed.” What need is there to seek further
proofs in the law or the prophets of this same thing? Seek, we need not say, for the passages
are neither few nor difficult to find; but what need to collect and apply to my argument the
proofs which are thickly sown and obvious, and by which it appears clear as day that sacrifice
may be paid to none but the supreme and true God? Here is one brief but decided, even
menacing, and certainly true utterance of that God whom the wisest of our adversaries so
highly extol. Let this be listened to, feared, fulfilled, that there may be no disobedient soul
cut off. “He that sacrifices,” He says, not because He needs anything, but because it behoves
us to be His possession. Hence the Psalmist in the Hebrew Scriptures sings, “I have said to
the Lord, Thou art my God, for Thou needest not my good.”1302 For we ourselves, who are
His own city, are His most noble and worthy sacrifice, and it is this mystery we celebrate in
our sacrifices, which are well known to the faithful, as we have explained in the preceding
books. For through the prophets the oracles of God declared that the sacrifices which the
Jews offered as a shadow of that which was to be would cease, and that the nations, from
the rising to the setting of the sun, would offer one sacrifice. From these oracles, which we
now see accomplished, we have made such selections as seemed suitable to our purpose in
this work. And therefore, where there is not this righteousness whereby the one supreme
God rules the obedient city according to His grace, so that it sacrifices to none but Him,
and whereby, in all the citizens of this obedient city, the soul consequently rules the body
and reason the vices in the rightful order, so that, as the individual just man, so also the
community and people of the just, live by faith, which works by love, that love whereby man

loves God as He ought to be loved, and his neighbor as himself,—there, I say, there is not
an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of right, and by a community of
interests. But if there is not this, there is not a people, if our definition be true, and therefore
there is no republic; for where there is no people there can be no republic.</p>

<pb n="953"/>
<head>Chapter 24.—The Definition Which Must Be Given of a People and a Republic, in
Order to Vindicate the Assumption of These Titles by the Romans and by Other
Kingdoms.</head>
<p>But if we discard this definition of a people, and, assuming another, say that a people
is an assemblage of reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement as to the
objects of their love, then, in order to discover the character of any people, we have only to
observe what they love. Yet whatever it loves, if only it is an assemblage of reasonable beings
and not of beasts, and is bound together by an agreement as to the objects of love, it is
reasonably called a people; and it will be a superior people in proportion as it is bound together
by higher interests, inferior in proportion as it is bound together by lower. According
to this definition of ours, the Roman people is a people, and its weal is without doubt a
commonwealth or republic. But what its tastes were in its early and subsequent days, and
how it declined into sanguinary seditions and then to social and civil wars, and so burst
asunder or rotted off the bond of concord in which the health of a people consists, history
shows, and in the preceding books I have related at large. And yet I would not on this account
say either that it was not a people, or that its administration was not a republic, so long as
there remains an assemblage of reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement
as to the objects of love. But what I say of this people and of this republic I must be understood
to think and say of the Athenians or any Greek state, of the Egyptians, of the early
Assyrian Babylon, and of every other nation, great or small, which had a public government.
For, in general, the city of the ungodly, which did not obey the command of God that it
should offer no sacrifice save to Him alone, and which, therefore, could not give to the soul
its proper command over the body, nor to the reason its just authority over the vices, is void
of true justice.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
<pb n="954"/>
<head>Chapter 25.—That Where There is No True Religion There are No True Virtues.</head>
<p>For though the soul may seem to rule the body admirably, and the reason the vices, if
the soul and reason do not themselves obey God, as God has commanded them to serve
Him, they have no proper authority over the body and the vices. For what kind of mistress
of the body and the vices can that mind be which is ignorant of the true God, and which,
instead of being subject to His authority, is prostituted to the corrupting influences of the
most vicious demons? It is for this reason that the virtues which it seems to itself to possess,
and by which it restrains the body and the vices that it may obtain and keep what it desires,
are rather vices than virtues so long as there is no reference to God in the matter. For although
some suppose that virtues which have a reference only to themselves, and are desired
only on their own account, are yet true and genuine virtues, the fact is that even then they
are inflated with pride, and are therefore to be reckoned vices rather than virtues. For as
that which gives life to the flesh is not derived from flesh, but is above it, so that which gives
blessed life to man is not derived from man, but is something above him; and what I say of
man is true of every celestial power and virtue whatsoever.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—Of the Peace Which is Enjoyed by the People that are Alienated from
God, and the Use Made of It by the People of God in the Time of Its Pilgrimage.</head>
<p>Wherefore, as the life of the flesh is the soul, so the blessed life of man is God, of whom
the sacred writings of the Hebrews say, “Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.”1303
Miserable, therefore, is the people which is alienated from God. Yet even this people has a
peace of its own which is not to be lightly esteemed, though, indeed, it shall not in the end
enjoy it, because it makes no good use of it before the end. But it is our interest that it enjoy
this peace meanwhile in this life; for as long as the two cities are commingled, we also enjoy
the peace of Babylon. For from Babylon the people of God is so freed that it meanwhile
sojourns in its company. And therefore the apostle also admonished the Church to pray
for kings and those in authority, assigning as the reason, “that we may live a quiet and
tranquil life in all godliness and love.”1304 And the prophet Jeremiah, when predicting the
captivity that was to befall the ancient people of God, and giving them the divine command
to go obediently to Babylonia, and thus serve their God, counselled them also to pray for
Babylonia, saying, “In the peace thereof shall ye have peace,”1305—the temporal peace which
the good and the wicked together enjoy.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—That the Peace of Those Who Serve God Cannot in This Mortal Life
Be Apprehended in Its Perfection.</head>
<p>But the peace which is peculiar to ourselves we enjoy now with God by faith, and shall
hereafter enjoy eternally with Him by sight. But the peace which we enjoy in this life,
whether common to all or peculiar to ourselves, is rather the solace of our misery than the
positive enjoyment of felicity. Our very righteousness, too, though true in so far as it has
respect to the true good, is yet in this life of such a kind that it consists rather in the remission
of sins than in the perfecting of virtues. Witness the prayer of the whole city of God in its
pilgrim state, for it cries to God by the mouth of all its members, “Forgive us our debts as
we forgive our debtors.”1306 And this prayer is efficacious not for those whose faith is
“without works and dead,”1307 but for those whose faith “worketh by love.”1308 For as
reason, though subjected to God, is yet “pressed down by the corruptible body,”1309 so long
as it is in this mortal condition, it has not perfect authority over vice, and therefore this
prayer is needed by the righteous. For though it exercises authority, the vices do not submit
without a struggle. For however well one maintains the conflict, and however thoroughly
he has subdued these enemies, there steals in some evil thing, which, if it does not find ready
expression in act, slips out by the lips, or insinuates itself into the thought; and therefore
his peace is not full so long as he is at war with his vices. For it is a doubtful conflict he
wages with those that resist, and his victory over those that are defeated is not secure, but
full of anxiety and effort. Amidst these temptations, therefore, of all which it has been
summarily said in the divine oracles, “Is not human life upon earth a temptation?”1310 who
but a proud man can presume that he so lives that he has no need to say to God, “Forgive
us our debts?” And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed up with vanity, and is
justly resisted by Him who abundantly gives grace to the humble. Whence it is said, “God
resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.”1311 In this, then, consists the righteousness
of a man, that he submit himself to God, his body to his soul, and his vices, even when
they rebel, to his reason, which either defeats or at least resists them; and also that he beg
from God grace to do his duty,1312 and the pardon of his sins, and that he render to God
thanks for all the blessings he receives. But, in that final peace to which all our righteousness
has reference, and for the sake of which it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound

resistance either from ourselves or from others, it will not be necessary that reason should
rule vices which no longer exist, but God shall rule the man, and the soul shall rule the body,
with a sweetness and facility suitable to the felicity of a life which is done with bondage.
And this condition shall there be eternal, and we shall be assured of its eternity; and thus
the peace of this blessedness and the blessedness of this peace shall be the supreme good.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, they who do not belong to this city of God shall inherit eternal
misery, which is also called the second death, because the soul shall then be separated from
God its life, and therefore cannot be said to live, and the body shall be subjected to eternal
pains. And consequently this second death shall be the more severe, because no death shall
terminate it. But war being contrary to peace, as misery to happiness, and life to death, it
is not without reason asked what kind of war can be found in the end of the wicked answering
to the peace which is declared to be the end of the righteous? The person who puts this
question has only to observe what it is in war that is hurtful and destructive, and he shall
see that it is nothing else than the mutual opposition and conflict of things. And can he
conceive a more grievous and bitter war than that in which the will is so opposed to passion,
and passion to the will, that their hostility can never be terminated by the victory of either,
and in which the violence of pain so conflicts with the nature of the body, that neither yields
to the other? For in this life, when this conflict has arisen, either pain conquers and death
expels the feeling of it, or nature conquers and health expels the pain. But in the world to
come the pain continues that it may torment, and the nature endures that it may be sensible
of it; and neither ceases to exist, lest punishment also should cease. Now, as it is through
the last judgment that men pass to these ends, the good to the supreme good, the evil to the
supreme evil, I will treat of this judgment in the following book.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="960"/>
<head>Chapter 1.—That Although God is Always Judging, It is Nevertheless Reasonable
to Confine Our Attention in This Book to His Last Judgment.</head>
<p>Intending to speak, in dependence on God’s grace, of the day of His final judgment,
and to affirm it against the ungodly and incredulous, we must first of all lay, as it were, in
the foundation of the edifice the divine declarations. Those persons who do not believe
such declarations do their best to oppose to them false and illusive sophisms of their own,
either contending that what is adduced from Scripture has another meaning, or altogether
denying that it is an utterance of God’s. For I suppose no man who understands what is
written, and believes it to be communicated by the supreme and true God through holy
men, refuses to yield and consent to these declarations, whether he orally confesses his
consent, or is from some evil influence ashamed or afraid to do so; or even, with an opinionativeness
closely resembling madness, makes strenuous efforts to defend what he knows
and believes to be false against what he knows and believes to be true.</p>
<p>That, therefore, which the whole Church of the true God holds and professes as its creed,
that Christ shall come from heaven to judge quick and dead, this we call the last day, or last
time, of the divine judgment. For we do not know how many days this judgment may occupy;
but no one who reads the Scriptures, however negligently, need be told that in them “day”
is customarily used for “time.” And when we speak of the day of God’s judgment, we add
the word last or final for this reason, because even now God judges, and has judged from
the beginning of human history, banishing from paradise, and excluding from the tree of
life, those first men who perpetrated so great a sin. Yea, He was certainly exercising judgment
also when He did not spare the angels who sinned, whose prince, overcome by envy, seduced
men after being himself seduced. Neither is it without God’s profound and just judgment
that the life of demons and men, the one in the air, the other on earth, is filled with misery,
calamities, and mistakes. And even though no one had sinned, it could only have been by
the good and right judgment of God that the whole rational creation could have been
maintained in eternal blessedness by a persevering adherence to its Lord. He judges, too,
not only in the mass, condemning the race of devils and the race of men to be miserable on
account of the original sin of these races, but He also judges the voluntary and personal acts
of individuals. For even the devils pray that they may not be tormented,1313 which proves
that without injustice they might either be spared or tormented according to their deserts.
And men are punished by God for their sins often visibly, always secretly, either in this life
or after death, although no man acts rightly save by the assistance of divine aid; and no man
or devil acts unrighteously save by the permission of the divine and most just judgment.
For, as the apostle says, “There is no unrighteousness with God;”1314 and as he elsewhere
<note type="footnote">1313 Matt. viii. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">1314 Rom. ix. 14.</note>

<pb n="961"/>
says, “His judgments are inscrutable, and His ways past finding out.”1315 In this book, then,
I shall speak, as God permits, not of those first judgments, nor of these intervening judgments
of God, but of the last judgment, when Christ is to come from heaven to judge the quick
and the dead. For that day is properly called the day of judgment, because in it there shall
be no room left for the ignorant questioning why this wicked person is happy and that
righteous man unhappy. In that day true and full happiness shall be the lot of none but the
good, while deserved and supreme misery shall be the portion of the wicked, and of them
only.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—That in the Mingled Web of Human Affairs God’s Judgment is Present,
Though It Cannot Be Discerned.</head>
<p>In this present time we learn to bear with equanimity the ills to which even good men
are subject, and to hold cheap the blessings which even the wicked enjoy. And consequently,
even in those conditions of life in which the justice of God is not apparent, His teaching is
salutary. For we do not know by what judgment of God this good man is poor and that bad
man rich; why he who, in our opinion, ought to suffer acutely for his abandoned life enjoys
himself, while sorrow pursues him whose praiseworthy life leads us to suppose he should
be happy; why the innocent man is dismissed from the bar not only unavenged, but even
condemned, being either wronged by the iniquity of the judge, or overwhelmed by false
evidence, while his guilty adversary, on the other hand, is not only discharged with impunity,
but even has his claims admitted; why the ungodly enjoys good health, while the godly pines
in sickness; why ruffians are of the soundest constitution, while they who could not hurt
any one even with a word are from infancy afflicted with complicated disorders; why he
who is useful to society is cut off by premature death, while those who, as it might seem,
ought never to have been so much as born have lives of unusual length; why he who is full
of crimes is crowned with honors, while the blameless man is buried in the darkness of
neglect. But who can collect or enumerate all the contrasts of this kind? But if this anomalous
state of things were uniform in this life, in which, as the sacred Psalmist says, “Man is like
to vanity, his days as a shadow that passeth away,”1316—so uniform that none but wicked
men won the transitory prosperity of earth, while only the good suffered its ills,—this could
be referred to the just and even benign judgment of God. We might suppose that they who
were not destined to obtain those everlasting benefits which constitute human blessedness
were either deluded by transitory blessings as the just reward of their wickedness, or were,
in God’s mercy, consoled by them, and that they who were not destined to suffer eternal
torments were afflicted with temporal chastisement for their sins, or were stimulated to
greater attainment in virtue. But now, as it is, since we not only see good men involved in
the ills of life, and bad men enjoying the good of it, which seems unjust, but also that evil
often overtakes evil men, and good surprises the good, the rather on this account are God’s
judgments unsearchable, and His ways past finding out. Although, therefore, we do not
know by what judgment these things are done or permitted to be done by God, with whom
is the highest virtue, the highest wisdom, the highest justice, no infirmity, no rashness, no
unrighteousness, yet it is salutary for us to learn to hold cheap such things, be they good or
evil, as attach indifferently to good men and bad, and to covet those good things which belong
only to good men, and flee those evils which belong only to evil men. But when we shall
have come to that judgment, the date of which is called peculiarly the day of judgment, and

sometimes the day of the Lord, we shall then recognize the justice of all God’s judgments,
not only of such as shall then be pronounced, but, of all which take effect from the beginning,
or may take effect before that time. And in that day we shall also recognize with what justice
so many, or almost all, the just judgments of God in the present life defy the scrutiny of
human sense or insight, though in this matter it is not concealed from pious minds that
what is concealed is just.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—What Solomon, in the Book of Ecclesiastes, Says Regarding the Things
Which Happen Alike to Good and Wicked Men.</head>
<p>Solomon, the wisest king of Israel, who reigned in Jerusalem, thus commences the book
called Ecclesiastes, which the Jews number among their canonical Scriptures: “Vanity of
vanities, said Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his
labor which he hath taken under the sun?”1317 And after going on to enumerate, with this
as his text, the calamities and delusions of this life, and the shifting nature of the present
time, in which there is nothing substantial, nothing lasting, he bewails, among the other
vanities that are under the sun, this also, that though wisdom excelleth folly as light excelleth
darkness, and though the eyes of the wise man are in his head, while the fool walketh in
darkness,1318 yet one event happeneth to them all, that is to say, in this life under the sun,
unquestionably alluding to those evils which we see befall good and bad men alike. He says,
further, that the good suffer the ills of life as if they were evil doers, and the bad enjoy the
good of life as if they were good. “There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there
be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked: again, there be
wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous. I said, that this
also is vanity.”1319 This wisest man devoted this whole book to a full exposure of this vanity,
evidently with no other object than that we might long for that life in which there is no
vanity under the sun, but verity under Him who made the sun. In this vanity, then, was it
not by the just and righteous judgment of God that man, made like to vanity, was destined
to pass away? But in these days of vanity it makes an important difference whether he resists
or yields to the truth, and whether he is destitute of true piety or a partaker of it,—important
not so far as regards the acquirement of the blessings or the evasion of the calamities of this
transitory and vain life, but in connection with the future judgment which shall make over
to good men good things, and to bad men bad things, in permanent, inalienable possession.
In fine, this wise man concludes this book of his by saying, “Fear God, and keep His commandments:
for this is every man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with
every despised person, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”1320 What truer, terser,
more salutary enouncement could be made? “Fear God, he says, and keep His commandments:
for this is every man.” For whosoever has real existence, is this, is a keeper of God’s
commandments; and he who is not this, is nothing. For so long as he remains in the likeness
of vanity, he is not renewed in the image of the truth. “For God shall bring into judgment
every work,”—that is, whatever man does in this life,—“whether it be good or whether it be

<head>Chapter 4.—That Proofs of the Last Judgment Will Be Adduced, First from the New
Testament, and Then from the Old.</head>
<p>The proofs, then, of this last judgment of God which I propose to adduce shall be drawn
first from the New Testament, and then from the Old. For although the Old Testament is
prior in point of time, the New has the precedence in intrinsic value; for the Old acts the
part of herald to the New. We shall therefore first cite passages from the New Testament,
and confirm them by quotations from the Old Testament. The Old contains the law and
the prophets, the New the gospel and the apostolic epistles. Now the apostle says “By the
law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets; now the righteousness of God is by faith of
Jesus Christ upon all them that believe.”1321 This righteousness of God belongs to the New
Testament, and evidence for it exists in the old books, that is to say, in the law and the
prophets. I shall first, then state the case, and then call the witnesses. This order Jesus Christ
Himself directs us to observe, saying, “The scribe instructed in the kingdom of God is like
a good householder, bringing out of his treasure things new and old.”1322 He did not say
“old and new,” which He certainly would have said had He not wished to follow the order
of merit rather than that of time.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—The Passages in Which the Saviour Declares that There Shall Be a Divine
Judgment in the End of the World.</head>
<p>The Saviour Himself, while reproving the cities in which He had done great works, but
which had not believed, and while setting them in unfavorable comparison with foreign
cities, says, “But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of
judgment than for you.”1323 And a little after He says, “Verily, I say unto you, It shall be
more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.”1324 Here He
most plainly predicts that a day of judgment is to come. And in another place He says, “The
men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because
they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. The queen
of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for
she came from the utter most parts of the earth to hear the words of Solomon; and behold,
a greater than Solomon is here.”1325 Two things we learn from this passage, that a judgment
is to take place, and that it is to take place at the resurrection of the dead. For when He
spoke of the Ninevites and the queen of the south, He certainly spoke of dead persons, and
yet He said that they should rise up in the day of judgment. He did not say, “They shall
condemn,” as if they themselves were to be the judges, but because, in comparison with
them, the others shall be justly condemned.</p>
<p>Again, in another passage, in which He was speaking of the present intermingling and
future separation of the good and bad,—the separation which shall be made in the day of
judgment,—He adduced a comparison drawn from the sown wheat and the tares sown
among them, and gave this explanation of it to His disciples: “He that soweth the good seed
is the Son of man,”1326 etc. Here, indeed, He did not name the judgment or the day of
judgment, but indicated it much more clearly by describing the circumstances, and foretold
that it should take place in the end of the world.</p>
<p>In like manner He says to His disciples, “Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed
me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye
also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”1327 Here we learn
that Jesus shall judge with His disciples. And therefore He said elsewhere to the Jews, “If I
by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be
your judges.”1328 Neither ought we to suppose that only twelve men shall judge along with

<pb n="968"/>
Him, though He says that they shall sit upon twelve thrones; for by the number twelve is
signified the completeness of the multitude of those who shall judge. For the two parts of
the number seven (which commonly symbolizes totality), that is to say four and three,
multiplied into one another, give twelve. For four times three, or three times four, are
twelve. There are other meanings, too, in this number twelve. Were not this the right interpretation
of the twelve thrones, then since we read that Matthias was ordained an apostle
in the room of Judas the traitor, the Apostle Paul, though he labored more than them all,1329
should have no throne of judgment; but he unmistakeably considers himself to be included
in the number of the judges when he says, “Know ye not that we shall judge angels?”1330
The same rule is to be observed in applying the number twelve to those who are to be judged.
For though it was said, “judging the twelve tribes of Israel,” the tribe of Levi, which is the
thirteenth, shall not on this account be exempt from judgment, neither shall judgment be
passed only on Israel and not on the other nations. And by the words “in the regeneration,”
He certainly meant the resurrection of the dead to be understood; for our flesh shall be regenerated
by incorruption, as our soul is regenerated by faith.</p>
<p>Many passages I omit, because, though they seem to refer to the last judgment, yet on
a closer examination they are found to be ambiguous, or to allude rather to some other
event,—whether to that coming of the Saviour which continually occurs in His Church,
that is, in His members, in which comes little by little, and piece by piece, since the whole
Church is His body, or to the destruction of the earthly Jerusalem. For when He speaks
even of this, He often uses language which is applicable to the end of the world and that last
and great day of judgment, so that these two events cannot be distinguished unless all the
corresponding passages bearing on the subject in the three evangelists, Matthew, Mark, and
Luke, are compared with one another,—for some things are put more obscurely by one
evangelist and more plainly by another,—so that it becomes apparent what things are meant
to be referred to one event. It is this which I have been at pains to do in a letter which I
wrote to Hesychius of blessed memory, bishop of Salon, and entitled, “Of the End of the
World.”1331</p>
<p>I shall now cite from the Gospel according to Matthew the passage which speaks of the
separation of the good from the wicked by the most efficacious and final judgment of Christ:
“When the Son of man,” he says, “shall come in His glory, . . . then shall He say also unto
them on His left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels.”1332 Then He in like manner recounts to the wicked the things they

had not done, but which He had said those on the right hand had done. And when they
ask when they had seen Him in need of these things, He replies that, inasmuch as they had
not done it to the least of His brethren, they had not done it unto Him, and concludes His
address in the words, “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous
into life eternal.” Moreover, the evangelist John most distinctly states that He had predicted
that the judgment should be at the resurrection of the dead. For after saying, “The Father
judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honor
the Son, even as they honor the Father: he that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the
Father which hath sent Him;” He immediately adds, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
come into judgment; but is passed from death to life.”1333 Here He said that believers on
Him should not come into judgment. How, then, shall they be separated from the wicked
by judgment, and be set at His right hand, unless judgment be in this passage used for condemnation?
For into judgment, in this sense, they shall not come who hear His word, and
believe on Him that sent Him.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—What is the First Resurrection, and What the Second.</head>
<p>After that He adds the words, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and
now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.
For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself.”1334
As yet He does not speak of the second resurrection, that is, the resurrection of the body,
which shall be in the end, but of the first, which now is. It is for the sake of making this
distinction that He says, “The hour is coming, and now is.” Now this resurrection regards
not the body, but the soul. For souls, too, have a death of their own in wickedness and sins,
whereby they are the dead of whom the same lips say, “Suffer the dead to bury their
dead,”1335—that is, let those who are dead in soul bury them that are dead in body. It is of
these dead, then—the dead in ungodliness and wickedness—that He says, “The hour is
coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that
hear shall live.” “They that hear,” that is, they who obey, believe, and persevere to the end.
Here no difference is made between the good and the bad. For it is good for all men to hear
His voice and live, by passing to the life of godliness from the death of ungodliness. Of this
death the Apostle Paul says, “Therefore all are dead, and He died for all, that they which
live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them and
rose again.”1336 Thus all, without one exception, were dead in sins, whether original or
voluntary sins, sins of ignorance, or sins committed against knowledge; and for all the dead
there died the one only person who lived, that is, who had no sin whatever, in order that
they who live by the remission of their sins should live, not to themselves, but to Him who
died for all, for our sins, and rose again for our justification, that we, believing in Him who
justifies the ungodly, and being justified from ungodliness or quickened from death, may
be able to attain to the first resurrection which now is. For in this first resurrection none
have a part save those who shall be eternally blessed; but in the second, of which He goes
on to speak, all, as we shall learn, have a part, both the blessed and the wretched. The one
is the resurrection of mercy, the other of judgment. And therefore it is written in the psalm,
“I will sing of mercy and of judgment: unto Thee, O Lord, will I sing.”1337</p>
<p>And of this judgment He went on to say, “And hath given Him authority to execute
judgment also, because He is the Son of man.” Here He shows that He will come to judge
in that flesh in which He had come to be judged. For it is to show this He says, “because
He is the Son of man.” And then follow the words for our purpose: “Marvel not at this:
for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall

come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.”1338 This judgment He uses here in the same sense
as a little before, when He says, “He that heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent
me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but is passed from death to life;”
i.e., by having a part in the first resurrection, by which a transition from death to life is made
in this present time, he shall not come into damnation, which He mentions by the name of
judgment, as also in the place where He says, “but they that have done evil unto the resurrection
of judgment,” i.e., of damnation. He, therefore, who would not be damned in the
second resurrection, let him rise in the first. For “the hour is coming, and now is, when the
dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live,” i.e., shall not come
into damnation, which is called the second death; into which death, after the second or
bodily resurrection, they shall be hurled who do not rise in the first or spiritual resurrection.
For “the hour is coming” (but here He does not say, “and now is,” because it shall come in
the end of the world in the last and greatest judgment of God) “when all that are in the
graves shall hear His voice and shall come forth.” He does not say, as in the first resurrection,
“And they that Hear shall live.” For all shall not live, at least with such life as ought alone
to be called life because it alone is blessed. For some kind of life they must have in order to
hear, and come forth from the graves in their rising bodies. And why all shall not live He
teaches in the words that follow: “They that have done good, to the resurrection of
life,”—these are they who shall live; “but they that have done evil, to the resurrection of
judgment,”—these are they who shall not live, for they shall die in the second death. They
have done evil because their life has been evil; and their life has been evil because it has not
been renewed in the first or spiritual resurrection which now is, or because they have not
persevered to the end in their renewed life. As, then, there are two regenerations, of which
I have already made mention,—the one according to faith, and which takes place in the
present life by means of baptism; the other according to the flesh, and which shall be accomplished
in its incorruption and immortality by means of the great and final judgment,—so
are there also two resurrections,—the one the first and spiritual resurrection, which has
place in this life, and preserves us from coming into the second death; the other the second,
which does not occur now, but in the end of the world, and which is of the body, not of the
soul, and which by the last judgment shall dismiss some into the second death, others into
that life which has no death.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—What is Written in the Revelation of John Regarding the Two Resurrections,
and the Thousand Years, and What May Reasonably Be Held on These
Points.</head>
<p>The evangelist John has spoken of these two resurrections in the book which is called
the Apocalypse, but in such a way that some Christians do not understand the first of the
two, and so construe the passage into ridiculous fancies. For the Apostle John says in the
foresaid book, “And I saw an angel come down from heaven. . . . Blessed and holy is he that
hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power; but they shall
be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.”1339 Those
who, on the strength of this passage, have suspected that the first resurrection is future and
bodily, have been moved, among other things, specially by the number of a thousand years,
as if it were a fit thing that the saints should thus enjoy a kind of Sabbath-rest during that
period, a holy leisure after the labors of the six thousand years since man was created, and
was on account of his great sin dismissed from the blessedness of paradise into the woes of
this mortal life, so that thus, as it is written, “One day is with the Lord as a thousand years,
and a thousand years as one day,”1340 there should follow on the completion of six thousand
years, as of six days, a kind of seventh-day Sabbath in the succeeding thousand years; and
that it is for this purpose the saints rise, viz., to celebrate this Sabbath. And this opinion
would not be objectionable, if it were believed that the joys of the saints in that Sabbath shall
be spiritual, and consequent on the presence of God; for I myself, too, once held this opinion.
1341 But, as they assert that those who then rise again shall enjoy the leisure of immoderate
carnal banquets, furnished with an amount of meat and drink such as not only to
shock the feeling of the temperate, but even to surpass the measure of credulity itself, such
assertions can be believed only by the carnal. They who do believe them are called by the
spiritual Chiliasts, which we may literally reproduce by the name Millenarians.1342 It were
a tedious process to refute these opinions point by point: we prefer proceeding to show
how that passage of Scripture should be understood.1343</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ Himself says, “No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and
spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man”1344—meaning by the strong man the

devil, because he had power to take captive the human race; and meaning by his goods
which he was to take, those who had been held by the devil in divers sins and iniquities, but
were to become believers in Himself. It was then for the binding of this strong one that the
apostle saw in the Apocalypse “an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the
abyss, and a chain in his hand. And he laid hold,” he says, “on the dragon, that old serpent,
which is called the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,”—that is, bridled and
restrained his power so that he could not seduce and gain possession of those who were to
be freed. Now the thousand years may be understood in two ways, so far as occurs to me:
either because these things happen in the sixth thousand of years or sixth millennium (the
latter part of which is now passing), as if during the sixth day, which is to be followed by a
Sabbath which has no evening, the endless rest of the saints, so that, speaking of a part under
the name of the whole, he calls the last part of the millennium—the part, that is, which had
yet to expire before the end of the world—a thousand years; or he used the thousand years
as an equivalent for the whole duration of this world, employing the number of perfection
to mark the fullness of time. For a thousand is the cube of ten. For ten times ten makes a
hundred, that is; the square on a plane superficies. But to give this superficies height, and
make it a cube, the hundred is again multiplied by ten, which gives a thousand. Besides, if
a hundred is sometimes used for totality, as when the Lord said by way of promise to him
that left all and followed Him “He shall receive in this world an hundredfold;”1345 of which
the apostle gives, as it were, an explanation when he says, “As having nothing, yet possessing
all things,”1346—for even of old it had been said, The whole world is the wealth of a believer,—
with how much greater reason is a thousand put for totality since it is the cube, while
the other is only the square? And for the same reason we cannot better interpret the words
of the psalm, “He hath been mindful of His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded
to a thousand generations,”1347 than by understanding it to mean “to all generations.”</p>
<p>“And he cast him into the abyss,”—i.e., cast the devil into the abyss. By the abyss is
meant the countless multitude of the wicked whose hearts are unfathomably deep in malignity
against the Church of God; not that the devil was not there before, but he is said to be cast
in thither, because, when prevented from harming believers, he takes more complete possession
of the ungodly. For that man is more abundantly possessed by the devil who is not
only alienated from God, but also gratuitously hates those who serve God. “And shut him
up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand
years should be fulfilled.” “Shut him up,”—i.e., prohibited him from going out, from doing

<pb n="974"/>
what was forbidden. And the addition of “set a seal upon him” seems to me to mean that
it was designed to keep it a secret who belonged to the devil’s party and who did not. For
in this world this is a secret, for we cannot tell whether even the man who seems to stand
shall fall, or whether he who seems to lie shall rise again. But by the chain and prison-house
of this interdict the devil is prohibited and restrained from seducing those nations which
belong to Christ, but which he formerly seduced or held in subjection. For before the
foundation of the world God chose to rescue these from the power of darkness, and to
translate them into the kingdom of the Son of His love, as the apostle says.1348 For what
Christian is not aware that he seduces nations even now, and draws them with himself to
eternal punishment, but not those predestined to eternal life? And let no one be dismayed
by the circumstance that the devil often seduces even those who have been regenerated in
Christ, and begun to walk in God’s way. For “the Lord knoweth them that are His,”1349
and of these the devil seduces none to eternal damnation. For it is as God, from whom
nothing is hid even of things future, that the Lord knows them; not as a man, who sees a
man at the present time (if he can be said to see one whose heart he does not see), but does
not see even himself so far as to be able to know what kind of person he is to be. The devil,
then, is bound and shut up in the abyss that he may not seduce the nations from which the
Church is gathered, and which he formerly seduced before the Church existed. For it is not
said “that he should not seduce any man,” but “that he should not seduce the nations”—meaning,
no doubt, those among which the Church exists—“till the thousand years should be
fulfilled,”—i.e., either what remains of the sixth day which consists of a thousand years, or
all the years which are to elapse till the end of the world.</p>
<p>The words, “that he should not seduce the nations till the thousand years should be
fulfilled,” are not to be understood as indicating that afterwards he is to seduce only those
nations from which the predestined Church is composed, and from seducing whom he is
restrained by that chain and imprisonment; but they are used in conformity with that usage
frequently employed in Scripture and exemplified in the psalm, “So our eyes wait upon the
Lord our God, until He have mercy upon us,”1350—not as if the eyes of His servants would
no longer wait upon the Lord their God when He had mercy upon them. Or the order of
the words is unquestionably this, “And he shut him up and set a seal upon him, till the
thousand years should be fulfilled;” and the interposed clause, “that he should seduce the
nations no more,” is not to be understood in the connection in which it stands, but separately,
and as if added afterwards, so that the whole sentence might be read, “And He shut him up
and set a seal upon him till the thousand years should be fulfilled, that he should seduce the

<head>Chapter 8.—Of the Binding and Loosing of the Devil.</head>
<p>“After that,” says John, “he must be loosed a little season.” If the binding and shutting
up of the devil means his being made unable to seduce the Church, must his loosing be the
recovery of this ability? By no means. For the Church predestined and elected before the
foundation of the world, the Church of which it is said, “The Lord knoweth them that are
His,” shall never be seduced by him. And yet there shall be a Church in this world even
when the devil shall be loosed, as there has been since the beginning, and shall be always,
the places of the dying being filled by new believers. For a little after John says that the
devil, being loosed, shall draw the nations whom he has seduced in the whole world to make
war against the Church, and that the number of these enemies shall be as the sand of the
sea. “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints
about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured
them. And the devil who seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where
the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and
ever.”1351 This relates to the last judgment, but I have thought fit to mention it now, lest
any one might suppose that in that short time during which the devil shall be loose there
shall be no Church upon earth, whether because the devil finds no Church, or destroys it
by manifold persecutions. The devil, then, is not bound during the whole time which this
book embraces,—that is, from the first coming of Christ to the end of the world, when He
shall come the second time,—not bound in this sense, that during this interval, which goes
by the name of a thousand years, he shall not seduce the Church, for not even when loosed
shall he seduce it. For certainly if his being bound means that he is not able or not permitted
to seduce the Church, what can the loosing of him mean but his being able or permitted to
do so? But God forbid that such should be the case! But the binding of the devil is his being
prevented from the exercise of his whole power to seduce men, either by violently forcing
or fraudulently deceiving them into taking part with him. If he were during so long a period
permitted to assail the weakness of men, very many persons, such as God would not wish
to expose to such temptation, would have their faith overthrown, or would be prevented
from believing; and that this might not happen, he is bound.</p>
<p>But when the short time comes he shall be loosed. For he shall rage with the whole
force of himself and his angels for three years and six months; and those with whom he
makes war shall have power to withstand all his violence and stratagems. And if he were
never loosed, his malicious power would be less patent, and less proof would be given of
the steadfast fortitude of the holy city: it would, in short, be less manifest what good use
the Almighty makes of his great evil. For the Almighty does not absolutely seclude the saints
from his temptation, but shelters only their inner man, where faith resides, that by outward
<note type="footnote">1351 Rev. xx. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="977"/>
temptation they may grow in grace. And He binds him that he may not, in the free and
eager exercise of his malice, hinder or destroy the faith of those countless weak persons,
already believing or yet to believe, from whom the Church must be increased and completed;
and he will in the end loose him, that the city of God may see how mighty an adversary it
has conquered, to the great glory of its Redeemer, Helper, Deliverer. And what are we in
comparison with those believers and saints who shall then exist, seeing that they shall be
tested by the loosing of an enemy with whom we make war at the greatest peril even when
he is bound? Although it is also certain that even in this intervening period there have been
and are some soldiers of Christ so wise and strong, that if they were to be alive in this mortal
condition at the time of his loosing, they would both most wisely guard against, and most
patiently endure, all his snares and assaults.</p>
<p>Now the devil was thus bound not only when the Church began to be more and more
widely extended among the nations beyond Judea, but is now and shall be bound till the
end of the world, when he is to be loosed. Because even now men are, and doubtless to the
end of the world shall be, converted to the faith from the unbelief in which he held them.
And this strong one is bound in each instance in which he is spoiled of one of his goods;
and the abyss in which he is shut up is not at an end when those die who were alive when
first he was shut up in it, but these have been succeeded, and shall to the end of the world
be succeeded, by others born after them with a like hate of the Christians, and in the depth
of whose blind hearts he is continually shut up as in an abyss. But it is a question whether,
during these three years and six months when he shall be loose, and raging with all his force,
any one who has not previously believed shall attach himself to the faith. For how in that
case would the words hold good, “Who entereth into the house of a strong one to spoil his
goods, unless first he shall have bound the strong one?” Consequently this verse seems to
compel us to believe that during that time, short as it is, no one will be added to the Christian
community, but that the devil will make war with those who have previously become
Christians, and that, though some of these may be conquered and desert to the devil, these
do not belong to the predestinated number of the sons of God. For it is not without reason
that John, the same apostle as wrote this Apocalypse, says in his epistle regarding certain
persons, “They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they
would no doubt have remained with us.”1352 But what shall become of the little ones? For
it is beyond all belief that in these days there shall not be found some Christian children
born, but not yet baptized, and that there shall not also be some born during that very
period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their parents shall not find some way of
bringing them to the laver of regeneration. But if this shall be the case, how shall these goods
be snatched from the devil when he is loose, since into his house no man enters to spoil his
<note type="footnote">1352 1 John ii. 19.</note>

<pb n="978"/>
goods unless he has first bound him? On the contrary, we are rather to believe that in these
days there shall be no lack either of those who fall away from, or of those who attach themselves
to the Church; but there shall be such resoluteness, both in parents to seek baptism
for their little ones, and in those who shall then first believe, that they shall conquer that
strong one, even though unbound,—that is, shall both vigilantly comprehend, and patiently
bear up against him, though employing such wiles and putting forth such force as he never
before used; and thus they shall be snatched from him even though unbound. And yet the
verse of the Gospel will not be untrue, “Who entereth into the house of the strong one to
spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?” For in accordance with
this true saying that order is observed—the strong one first bound, and then his goods
spoiled; for the Church is so increased by the weak and strong from all nations far and near,
that by its most robust faith in things divinely predicted and accomplished, it shall be able
to spoil the goods of even the unbound devil. For as we must own that, “when iniquity
abounds, the love of many waxes cold,”1353 and that those who have not been written in
the book of life shall in large numbers yield to the severe and unprecedented persecutions
and stratagems of the devil now loosed, so we cannot but think that not only those whom
that time shall find sound in the faith, but also some who till then shall be without, shall
become firm in the faith they have hitherto rejected and mighty to conquer the devil even
though unbound, God’s grace aiding them to understand the Scriptures, in which, among
other things, there is foretold that very end which they themselves see to be arriving. And
if this shall be so, his binding is to be spoken of as preceding, that there might follow a
spoiling of him both bound and loosed; for it is of this it is said, “Who shall enter into the
house of the strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?”</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—What the Reign of the Saints with Christ for a Thousand Years Is, and
How It Differs from the Eternal Kingdom.</head>
<p>But while the devil is bound, the saints reign with Christ during the same thousand
years, understood in the same way, that is, of the time of His first coming.1354 For, leaving
out of account that kingdom concerning which He shall say in the end, “Come, ye blessed
of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you,”1355 the Church could not
now be called His kingdom or the kingdom of heaven unless His saints were even now
reigning with Him, though in another and far different way; for to His saints He says, “Lo,
I am with you always, even to the end of the world.”1356 Certainly it is in this present time
that the scribe well instructed in the kingdom of God, and of whom we have already spoken,
brings forth from his treasure things new and old. And from the Church those reapers
shall gather out the tares which He suffered to grow with the wheat till the harvest, as He
explains in the words “The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
As therefore the tares are gathered together and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end
of the world. The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom
all offenses.”1357 Can He mean out of that kingdom in which are no offenses? Then it must
be out of His present kingdom, the Church, that they are gathered. So He says, “He that
breaketh one of the least of these commandments, and teacheth men so, shall be called least
in the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth and teacheth thus shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven.”1358 He speaks of both as being in the kingdom of heaven, both the
man who does not perform the commandments which He teaches,—for “to break” means
not to keep, not to perform,—and the man who does and teaches as He did; but the one He
calls least, the other great. And He immediately adds, “For I say unto you, that except your
righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,”—that is, the righteousness of those
who break what they teach; for of the scribes and Pharisees He elsewhere says, “For they
say and do not;”1359—unless therefore, your righteousness exceed theirs that is, so that you
do not break but rather do what you teach, “ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.”1360
We must understand in one sense the kingdom of heaven in which exist together both he
who breaks what he teaches and he who does it, the one being least, the other great, and in
<note type="footnote">1354 Between His first and second coming.</note>

<note type="footnote">1360 Matt. v. 20.</note>

<pb n="980"/>
another sense the kingdom of heaven into which only he who does what he teaches shall
enter. Consequently, where both classes exist, it is the Church as it now is, but where only
the one shall exist, it is the Church as it is destined to be when no wicked person shall be in
her. Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven.
Accordingly, even now His saints reign with Him, though otherwise than as they shall reign
hereafter; and yet, though the tares grow in the Church along with the wheat, they do not
reign with Him. For they reign with Him who do what the apostle says, “If ye be risen with
Christ, mind the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Seek
those things which are above, not the things which are on the earth.”1361 Of such persons
he also says that their conversation is in heaven.1362 In fine, they reign with Him who are
so in His kingdom that they themselves are His kingdom. But in what sense are those the
kingdom of Christ who, to say no more, though they are in it until all offenses are gathered
out of it at the end of the world, yet seek their own things in it, and not the things that are
Christ’s?1363</p>
<p>It is then of this kingdom militant, in which conflict with the enemy is still maintained,
and war carried on with warring lusts, or government laid upon them as they yield, until
we come to that most peaceful kingdom in which we shall reign without an enemy, and it
is of this first resurrection in the present life, that the Apocalypse speaks in the words just
quoted. For, after saying that the devil is bound a thousand years and is afterwards loosed
for a short season, it goes on to give a sketch of what the Church does or of what is done in
the Church in those days, in the words, “And I saw seats and them that sat upon them, and
judgment was given.” It is not to be supposed that this refers to the last judgment, but to
the seats of the rulers and to the rulers themselves by whom the Church is now governed.
And no better interpretation of judgment being given can be produced than that which we
have in the words, “What ye bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what ye loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven.”1364 Whence the apostle says, “What have I to do with
judging them that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?”1365 “And the souls,”
says John, “of those who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of
God,”—understanding what he afterwards says, “reigned with Christ a thousand
years,”1366—that is, the souls of the martyrs not yet restored to their bodies. For the souls
of the pious dead are not separated from the Church, which even now is the kingdom of

Christ; otherwise there would be no remembrance made of them at the altar of God in the
partaking of the body of Christ, nor would it do any good in danger to run to His baptism,
that we might not pass from this life without it; nor to reconciliation, if by penitence or a
bad conscience any one may be severed from His body. For why are these things practised,
if not because the faithful, even though dead, are His members? Therefore, while these
thousand years run on, their souls reign with Him, though not as yet in conjunction with
their bodies. And therefore in another part of this same book we read, “Blessed are the dead
who die in the Lord from henceforth and now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their
labors; for their works do follow them.”1367 The Church, then, begins its reign with Christ
now in the living and in the dead. For, as the apostle says, “Christ died that He might be
Lord both of the living and of the dead.”1368 But he mentioned the souls of the martyrs
only, because they who have contended even to death for the truth, themselves principally
reign after death; but, taking the part for the whole, we understand the words of all others
who belong to the Church, which is the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>As to the words following, “And if any have not worshipped the beast nor his image,
nor have received his inscription on their forehead, or on their hand,” we must take them
of both the living and the dead. And what this beast is, though it requires a more careful
investigation, yet it is not inconsistent with the true faith to understand it of the ungodly
city itself, and the community of unbelievers set in opposition to the faithful people and the
city of God. “His image” seems to me to mean his simulation, to wit, in those men who
profess to believe, but live as unbelievers. For they pretend to be what they are not, and are
called Christians, not from a true likeness but from a deceitful image. For to this beast belong
not only the avowed enemies of the name of Christ and His most glorious city, but also the
tares which are to be gathered out of His kingdom, the Church, in the end of the world.
And who are they who do not worship the beast and his image, if not those who do what
the apostle says, “Be not yoked with unbelievers?”1369 For such do not worship, i.e., do not
consent, are not subjected; neither do they receive the inscription, the brand of crime, on
their forehead by their profession, on their hand by their practice. They, then, who are free
from these pollutions, whether they still live in this mortal flesh, or are dead, reign with
Christ even now, through this whole interval which is indicated by the thousand years, in
a fashion suited to this time.</p>
<p>“The rest of them,” he says, “did not live.” For now is the hour when the dead shall hear
the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live; and the rest of them shall not live.
The words added, “until the thousand years are finished,” mean that they did not live in the
<note type="footnote">1367 Rev. xiv. 13.</note>

<note type="footnote">1369 2 Cor. vi. 14.</note>

<pb n="982"/>
time in which they ought to have lived by passing from death to life. And therefore, when
the day of the bodily resurrection arrives, they shall come out of their graves, not to life, but
to judgment, namely, to damnation, which is called the second death. For whosoever has
not lived until the thousand years be finished, i.e., during this whole time in which the first
resurrection is going on,—whosoever has not heard the voice of the Son of God, and passed
from death to life,—that man shall certainly in the second resurrection, the resurrection of
the flesh, pass with his flesh into the second death. For he goes to say “This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection,” or who experiences
it. Now he experiences it who not only revives from the death of sin, but continues in this
renewed life. “In these the second death hath no power.” Therefore it has power in the rest,
of whom he said above, “The rest of them did not live until the thousand years were finished;”
for in this whole intervening time called a thousand years, however lustily they lived in the
body, they were not quickened to life out of that death in which their wickedness held them,
so that by this revived life they should become partakers of the first resurrection, and so the
second death should have no power over them.</p>

<pb n="983"/>
<head>Chapter 10.—What is to Be Replied to Those Who Think that Resurrection Pertains
Only to Bodies and Not to Souls.</head>
<p>There are some who suppose that resurrection can be predicated only of the body, and
therefore they contend that this first resurrection (of the Apocalypse) is a bodily resurrection.
For, say they, “to rise again” can only be said of things that fall. Now, bodies fall in death.1370
There cannot, therefore, be a resurrection of souls, but of bodies. But what do they say to
the apostle who speaks of a resurrection of souls? For certainly it was in the inner and not
the outer man that those had risen again to whom he says, “If ye have risen with Christ,
mind the things that are above.”1371 The same sense he elsewhere conveyed in other words,
saying, “That as Christ has risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may
walk in newness of life.”1372 So, too, “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light.1373” As to what they say about nothing being able to rise
again but what falls, whence they conclude that resurrection pertains to bodies only, and
not to souls, because bodies fall, why do they make nothing of the words, “Ye that fear the
Lord, wait for His mercy; and go not aside lest ye fall;”1374 and “To his own Master he stands
or falls;”1375 and “He that thinketh he standeth, let him take heed lest he fall?”1376 For I
fancy this fall that we are to take heed against is a fall of the soul, not of the body. If, then,
rising again belongs to things that fall, and souls fall, it must be owned that souls also rise
again. To the words, “In them the second death hath no power,” are added the words, “but
they shall be priests of God and Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years;” and
this refers not to the bishops alone, and presbyters, who are now specially called priests in
the Church; but as we call all believers Christians on account of the mystical chrism, so we
call all priests because they are members of the one Priest. Of them the Apostle Peter says,
“A holy people, a royal priesthood.”1377 Certainly he implied, though in a passing and incidental
way, that Christ is God, saying priests of God and Christ, that is, of the Father and
the Son, though it was in His servant-form and as Son of man that Christ was made a Priest
for ever after the order of Melchisedec. But this we have already explained more than once.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Of Gog and Magog, Who are to Be Roused by the Devil to Persecute
the Church, When He is Loosed in the End of the World.</head>
<p>“And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed from his prison, and
shall go out to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog,
and shall draw them to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.” This then, is his
purpose in seducing them, to draw them to this battle. For even before this he was wont to
use as many and various seductions as he could continue. And the words “he shall go out”
mean, he shall burst forth from lurking hatred into open persecution. For this persecution,
occurring while the final judgment is imminent, shall be the last which shall be endured by
the holy Church throughout the world, the whole city of Christ being assailed by the whole
city of the devil, as each exists on earth. For these nations which he names Gog and Magog
are not to be understood of some barbarous nations in some part of the world, whether the
Getæ and Massagetæ, as some conclude from the initial letters, or some other foreign nations
not under the Roman government. For John marks that they are spread over the whole
earth, when he says, “The nations which are in the four corners of the earth,” and he added
that these are Gog and Magog. The meaning of these names we find to be, Gog, “a roof,”
Magog, “from a roof,”—a house, as it were, and he who comes out of the house. They are
therefore the nations in which we found that the devil was shut up as in an abyss, and the
devil himself coming out from them and going forth, so that they are the roof, he from the
roof. Or if we refer both words to the nations, not one to them and one to the devil, then
they are both the roof, because in them the old enemy is at present shut up, and as it were
roofed in; and they shall be from the roof when they break forth from concealed to open
hatred. The words, “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the
camp of the saints and the beloved city,” do not mean that they have come, or shall come,
to one place, as if the camp of the saints and the beloved city should be in some one place;
for this camp is nothing else than the Church of Christ extending over the whole world.
And consequently wherever the Church shall be,—and it shall be in all nations, as is signified
by “the breadth of the earth,”—there also shall be the camp of the saints and the beloved
city, and there it shall be encompassed by the savage persecution of all its enemies; for they
too shall exist along with it in all nations,—that is, it shall be straitened, and hard pressed,
and shut up in the straits of tribulation, but shall not desert its military duty, which is signified
by the word “camp.”</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Whether the Fire that Came Down Out of Heaven and Devoured
Them Refers to the Last Punishment of the Wicked.</head>
<p>The words, “And fire came down out of heaven and devoured them,” are not to be understood
of the final punishment which shall be inflicted when it is said, “Depart from me,
ye cursed, into everlasting fire;”1378 for then they shall be cast into the fire, not fire come
down out of heaven upon them. In this place “fire out of heaven” is well understood of the
firmness of the saints, wherewith they refuse to yield obedience to those who rage against
them. For the firmament is “heaven,” by whose firmness these assailants shall be pained
with blazing zeal, for they shall be impotent to draw away the saints to the party of Antichrist.
This is the fire which shall devour them, and this is “from God;” for it is by God’s grace the
saints become unconquerable, and so torment their enemies. For as in a good sense it is
said, “The zeal of Thine house hath consumed me,”1379 so in a bad sense it is said, “Zeal
hath possessed the uninstructed people, and now fire shall consume the enemies.”1380 “And
now,” that is to say, not the fire of the last judgment. Or if by this fire coming down out of
heaven and consuming them, John meant that blow wherewith Christ in His coming is to
strike those persecutors of the Church whom He shall then find alive upon earth, when He
shall kill Antichrist with the breath of His mouth,1381 then even this is not the last judgment
of the wicked; but the last judgment is that which they shall suffer when the bodily resurrection
has taken place.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Whether the Time of the Persecution or Antichrist Should Be Reckoned
in the Thousand Years.</head>
<p>This last persecution by Antichrist shall last for three years and six months, as we have
already said, and as is affirmed both in the book of Revelation and by Daniel the prophet.
Though this time is brief, yet not without reason is it questioned whether it is comprehended
in the thousand years in which the devil is bound and the saints reign with Christ, or
whether this little season should be added over and above to these years. For if we say that
they are included in the thousand years, then the saints reign with Christ during a more
protracted period than the devil is bound. For they shall reign with their King and Conqueror
mightily even in that crowning persecution when the devil shall now be unbound and shall
rage against them with all his might. How then does Scripture define both the binding of
the devil and the reign of the saints by the same thousand years, if the binding of the devil
ceases three years and six months before this reign of the saints with Christ? On the other
hand, if we say that the brief space of this persecution is not to be reckoned as a part of the
thousand years, but rather as an additional period, we shall indeed be able to interpret the
words, “The priests of God and of Christ shall reign with Him a thousand years; and when
the thousand years shall be finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;” for thus they
signify that the reign of the saints and the bondage of the devil shall cease simultaneously,
so that the time of the persecution we speak of should be contemporaneous neither with
the reign of the saints nor with the imprisonment of Satan, but should be reckoned over
and above as a superadded portion of time. But then in this case we are forced to admit
that the saints shall not reign with Christ during that persecution. But who can dare to say
that His members shall not reign with Him at that very juncture when they shall most of
all, and with the greatest fortitude, cleave to Him, and when the glory of resistance and the
crown of martyrdom shall be more conspicuous in proportion to the hotness of the battle?
Or if it is suggested that they may be said not to reign, because of the tribulations which
they shall suffer, it will follow that all the saints who have formerly, during the thousand
years, suffered tribulation, shall not be said to have reigned with Christ during the period
of their tribulation, and consequently even those whose souls the author of this book says
that he saw, and who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and the word of God, did not
reign with Christ when they were suffering persecution, and they were not themselves the
kingdom of Christ, though Christ was then pre-eminently possessing them. This is indeed
perfectly absurd, and to be scouted. But assuredly the victorious souls of the glorious martyrs
having overcome and finished all griefs and toils, and having laid down their mortal members,
have reigned and do reign with Christ till the thousand years are finished, that they may
afterwards reign with Him when they have received their immortal bodies. And therefore
during these three years and a half the souls of those who were slain for His testimony, both
those which formerly passed from the body and those which shall pass in that last persecution,

shall reign with Him till the mortal world come to an end, and pass into that kingdom in
which there shall be no death. And thus the reign of the saints with Christ shall last longer
than the bonds and imprisonment of the devil, because they shall reign with their King the
Son of God for these three years and a half during which the devil is no longer bound. It
remains, therefore, that when we read that “the priests of God and of Christ shall reign with
Him a thousand years; and when the thousand years are finished, the devil shall be loosed
from his imprisonment,” that we understand either that the thousand years of the reign of
the saints does not terminate, though the imprisonment of the devil does,—so that both
parties have their thousand years, that is, their complete time, yet each with a different actual
duration approriate to itself, the kingdom of the saints being longer, the imprisonment of
the devil shorter, —or at least that, as three years and six months is a very short time, it is
not reckoned as either deducted from the whole time of Satan’s imprisonment, or as added
to the whole duration of the reign of the saints, as we have shown above in the sixteenth
book1382 regarding the round number of four hundred years, which were specified as four
hundred, though actually somewhat more; and similar expressions are often found in the
sacred writings, if one will mark them.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Damnation of the Devil and His Adherents; And a Sketch of
the Bodily Resurrection of All the Dead, and of the Final Retributive Judgment.</head>
<p>After this mention of the closing persecution, he summarily indicates all that the devil,
and the city of which he is the prince, shall suffer in the last judgment. For he says, “And
the devil who seduced them is cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, in which are the beast
and the false prophet, and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” We
have already said that by the beast is well understood the wicked city. His false prophet is
either Antichrist or that image or figment of which we have spoken in the same place. After
this he gives a brief narrative of the last judgment itself, which shall take place at the second
or bodily resurrection of the dead, as it had been revealed to him: “I saw a throne great and
white, and One sitting on it from whose face the heaven and the earth fled away, and their
place was not found.” He does not say, “I saw a throne great and white, and One sitting on
it, and from His face the heaven and the earth fled away,” for it had not happened then, i.e.,
before the living and the dead were judged; but he says that he saw Him sitting on the throne
from whose face heaven and earth fled away, but afterwards. For when the judgment is
finished, this heaven and earth shall cease to be, and there will be a new heaven and a new
earth. For this world shall pass away by transmutation, not by absolute destruction. And
therefore the apostle says, “For the figure of this world passeth away. I would have you be
without anxiety.”1383 The figure, therefore, passes away, not the nature. After John had
said that he had seen One sitting on the throne from whose face heaven and earth fled,
though not till afterwards, he said, “And I saw the dead, great and small: and the books
were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of the life of each man: and
the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their
deeds.” He said that the books were opened, and a book; but he left us at a loss as to the
nature of this book, “which is,” he says, “the book of the life of each man.” By those books,
then, which he first mentioned, we are to understand the sacred books old and new, that
out of them it might be shown what commandments God had enjoined; and that book of
the life of each man is to show what commandments each man has done or omitted to do.
If this book be materially considered, who can reckon its size or length, or the time it would
take to read a book in which the whole life of every man is recorded? Shall there be present
as many angels as men, and shall each man hear his life recited by the angel assigned to
him? In that case there will be not one book containing all the lives, but a separate book for
every life. But our passage requires us to think of one only. “And another book was opened,”
it says. We must therefore understand it of a certain divine power, by which it shall be
brought about that every one shall recall to memory all his own works, whether good or
evil, and shall mentally survey them with a marvellous rapidity, so that this knowledge will
<note type="footnote">1383 1 Cor. vii. 31, 32.</note>

<pb n="989"/>
either accuse or excuse conscience, and thus all and each shall be simultaneously judged.
And this divine power is called a book, because in it we shall as it were read all that it causes
us to remember. That he may show who the dead, small and great, are who are to be judged,
he recurs to this which he had omitted or rather deferred, and says, “And the sea presented
the dead which were in it; and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them.” This
of course took place before the dead were judged, yet it is mentioned after. And so, I say,
he returns again to what he had omitted. But now he preserves the order of events, and for
the sake of exhibiting it repeats in its own proper place what he had already said regarding
the dead who were judged. For after he had said, “And the sea presented the dead which
were in it, and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them,” he immediately subjoined
what he had already said, “and they were judged every man according to their works.”
For this is just what he had said before, “And the dead were judged according to their works.”</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Who the Dead are Who are Given Up to Judgment by the Sea, and by
Death and Hell.</head>
<p>But who are the dead which were in the sea, and which the sea presented? For we
cannot suppose that those who die in the sea are not in hell, nor that their bodies are preserved
in the sea; nor yet, which is still more absurd, that the sea retained the good, while
hell received the bad. Who could believe this? But some very sensibly suppose that in this
place the sea is put for this world. When John then wished to signify that those whom Christ
should find still alive in the body were to be judged along with those who should rise again,
he called them dead, both the good to whom it is said, “For ye are dead, and your life is hid
with Christ in God,”1384 and the wicked of whom it is said, “Let the dead bury their
dead.”1385 They may also be called dead, because they wear mortal bodies, as the apostle
says, “The body indeed is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness;”
1386 proving that in a living man in the body there is both a body which is dead, and
a spirit which is life. Yet he did not say that the body was mortal, but dead, although immediately
after he speaks in the more usual way of mortal bodies. These, then, are the dead
which were in the sea, and which the sea presented, to wit, the men who were in this world,
because they had not yet died, and whom the world presented for judgment. “And death
and hell,” he says, “gave up the dead which were in them.” The sea presented them because
they had merely to be found in the place where they were; but death and hell gave them up
or restored them, because they called them back to life, which they had already quitted. And
perhaps it was not without reason that neither death nor hell were judged sufficient alone,
and both were mentioned,—death to indicate the good, who have suffered only death and
not hell; hell to indicate the wicked, who suffer also the punishment of hell. For if it does
not seem absurd to believe that the ancient saints who believed in Christ and His then future
coming, were kept in places far removed indeed from the torments of the wicked, but yet
in hell,1387 until Christ’s blood and His descent into these places delivered them, certainly
good Christians, redeemed by that precious price already paid, are quite unacquainted with
hell while they wait for their restoration to the body, and the reception of their reward.
After saying, “They were judged every man according to their works,” he briefly added what
the judgment was: “Death and hell were cast into the lake of fire;” by these names designating
the devil and the whole company of his angels, for he is the author of death and the pains
of hell. For this is what he had already, by anticipation, said in clearer language: “The
devil who seduced them was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone.” The obscure addition

he had made in the words, “in which were also the beast and the false prophet,” he here explains,
“They who were not found written in the book of life were cast into the lake of fire.”
This book is not for reminding God, as if things might escape Him by forgetfulness, but it
symbolizes His predestination of those to whom eternal life shall be given. For it is not that
God is ignorant, and reads in the book to inform Himself, but rather His infallible prescience
is the book of life in which they are written, that is to say, known beforehand.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Of the New Heaven and the New Earth.</head>
<p>Having finished the prophecy of judgment, so far as the wicked are concerned, it remains
that he speak also of the good. Having briefly explained the Lord’s words, “These will go
away into everlasting punishment,” it remains that he explain the connected words, “but
the righteous into life eternal.”1388 “And I saw,” he says, “a new heaven and a new earth:
for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away; and there is no more sea.”1389 This
will take place in the order which he has by anticipation declared in the words, “I saw One
sitting on the throne, from whose face heaven and earth fled.” For as soon as those who are
not written in the book of life have been judged and cast into eternal fire,—the nature of
which fire, or its position in the world or universe, I suppose is known to no man, unless
perhaps the divine Spirit reveal it to some one,—then shall the figure of this world pass away
in a conflagration of universal fire, as once before the world was flooded with a deluge of
universal water. And by this universal conflagration the qualities of the corruptible elements
which suited our corruptible bodies shall utterly perish, and our substance shall receive such
qualities as shall, by a wonderful transmutation, harmonize with our immortal bodies, so
that, as the world itself is renewed to some better thing, it is fitly accommodated to men,
themselves renewed in their flesh to some better thing. As for the statement, “And there
shall be no more sea,” I would not lightly say whether it is dried up with that excessive heat,
or is itself also turned into some better thing. For we read that there shall be a new heaven
and a new earth, but I do not remember to have anywhere read anything of a new sea, unless
what I find in this same book, “As it were a sea of glass like crystal.”1390 But he was not
then speaking of this end of the world, neither does he seem to speak of a literal sea, but “as
it were a sea.” It is possible that, as prophetic diction delights in mingling figurative and
real language, and thus in some sort veiling the sense, so the words “And there is no more
sea” may be taken in the same sense as the previous phrase, “And the sea presented the dead
which were in it.” For then there shall be no more of this world, no more of the surgings
and restlessness of human life, and it is this which is symbolized by the sea.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Of the Endless Glory of the Church.</head>
<p>“And I saw,” he says, “a great city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice from the throne,
saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they
shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them. And God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, but neither
shall there be any more pain: because the former things have passed away. And He that
sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.”1391 This city is said to come down
out of heaven, because the grace with which God formed it is of heaven. Wherefore He says
to it by Isaiah, “I am the Lord that formed thee.”1392 It is indeed descended from heaven
from its commencement, since its citizens during the course of this world grow by the grace
of God, which cometh down from above through the laver of regeneration in the Holy Ghost
sent down from heaven. But by God’s final judgment, which shall be administered by His
Son Jesus Christ, there shall by God’s grace be manifested a glory so pervading and so new,
that no vestige of what is old shall remain; for even our bodies shall pass from their old
corruption and mortality to new incorruption and immortality. For to refer this promise
to the present time, in which the saints are reigning with their King a thousand years, seems
to me excessively barefaced, when it is most distinctly said, “God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, but there shall
be no more pain.” And who is so absurd, and blinded by contentious opinionativeness, as
to be audacious enough to affirm that in the midst of the calamities of this mortal state,
God’s people, or even one single saint, does live, or has ever lived, or shall ever live, without
tears or pain,—the fact being that the holier a man is, and the fuller of holy desire, so much
the more abundant is the tearfulness of his supplication? Are not these the utterances of a
citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem: “My tears have been my meat day and night;”1393 and
“Every night shall I make my bed to swim; with my tears shall I water my couch;”1394 and
“My groaning is not hid from Thee;”1395 and “My sorrow was renewed?”1396 Or are not
those God’s children who groan, being burdened, not that they wish to be unclothed, but
clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life?1397 Do not they even who have
the first-fruits of the Spirit groan within themselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption

of their body?1398 Was not the Apostle Paul himself a citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem,
and was he not so all the more when he had heaviness and continual sorrow of heart for his
Israelitish brethren?1399 But when shall there be no more death in that city, except when
it shall be said, “O death, where is thy contention?1400 O death, where is thy sting? The
sting of death is sin.”1401 Obviously there shall be no sin when it can be said, “Where
is”—But as for the present it is not some poor weak citizen of this city, but this same Apostle
John himself who says, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us.”1402 No doubt, though this book is called the Apocalypse, there are in it many
obscure passages to exercise the mind of the reader, and there are few passages so plain as
to assist us in the interpretation of the others, even though we take pains; and this difficulty
is increased by the repetition of the same things, in forms so different, that the things referred
to seem to be different, although in fact they are only differently stated. But in the words,
“God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, but there shall be no more pain,” there is so manifest a reference to the
future world and the immortality and eternity of the saints,—for only then and only there
shall such a condition be realized,—that if we think this obscure, we need not expect to find
anything plain in any part of Scripture.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—What the Apostle Peter Predicted Regarding the Last Judgment.</head>
<p>Let us now see what the Apostle Peter predicted concerning this judgment. “There shall
come,” he says, “in the last days scoffers. . . . Nevertheless we, according to His promise,
look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”1403 There is
nothing said here about the resurrection of the dead, but enough certainly regarding the
destruction of this world. And by his reference to the deluge he seems as it were to suggest
to us how far we should believe the ruin of the world will extend in the end of the world.
For he says that the world which then was perished, and not only the earth itself, but also
the heavens, by which we understand the air, the place and room of which was occupied by
the water. Therefore the whole, or almost the whole, of the gusty atmosphere (which he
calls heaven, or rather the heavens, meaning the earth’s atmosphere, and not the upper air
in which sun, moon, and stars are set) was turned into moisture, and in this way perished
together with the earth, whose former appearance had been destroyed by the deluge. “But
the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto
fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.” Therefore the heavens and
the earth, or the world which was preserved from the water to stand in place of that world
which perished in the flood, is itself reserved to fire at last in the day of the judgment and
perdition of ungodly men. He does not hesitate to affirm that in this great change men also
shall perish: their nature, however, shall notwithstanding continue, though in eternal punishments.
Some one will perhaps put the question, If after judgment is pronounced the
world itself is to burn, where shall the saints be during the conflagration, and before it is
replaced by a new heavens and a new earth, since somewhere they must be, because they
have material bodies? We may reply that they shall be in the upper regions into which the
flame of that conflagration shall not ascend, as neither did the water of the flood; for they
shall have such bodies that they shall be wherever they wish. Moreover, when they have
become immortal and incorruptible, they shall not greatly dread the blaze of that conflagration,
as the corruptible and mortal bodies of the three men were able to live unhurt in the
blazing furnace.</p>

<pb n="996"/>
<head>Chapter 19.—What the Apostle Paul Wrote to the Thessalonians About the Manifestation
of Antichrist Which Shall Precede the Day of the Lord.</head>
<p>I see that I must omit many of the statements of the gospels and epistles about this last
judgment, that this volume may not become unduly long; but I can on no account omit
what the Apostle Paul says, in writing to the Thessalonians, “We beseech you, brethren, by
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,”1404 etc.</p>
<p>No one can doubt that he wrote this of Antichrist and of the day of judgment, which
he here calls the day of the Lord, nor that he declared that this day should not come unless
he first came who is called the apostate —apostate, to wit, from the Lord God. And if this
may justly be said of all the ungodly, how much more of him? But it is uncertain in what
temple he shall sit, whether in that ruin of the temple which was built by Solomon, or in the
Church; for the apostle would not call the temple of any idol or demon the temple of God.
And on this account some think that in this passage Antichrist means not the prince himself
alone, but his whole body, that is, the mass of men who adhere to him, along with him their
prince; and they also think that we should render the Greek more exactly were we to read,
not “in the temple of God,” but “for” or “as the temple of God,” as if he himself were the
temple of God, the Church.1405 Then as for the words, “And now ye know what withholdeth,”
i.e., ye know what hindrance or cause of delay there is, “that he might be revealed in
his own time;” they show that he was unwilling to make an explicit statement, because he
said that they knew. And thus we who have not their knowledge wish and are not able even
with pains to understand what the apostle referred to, especially as his meaning is made still
more obscure by what he adds. For what does he mean by “For the mystery of iniquity doth
already work: only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way: and
then shall the wicked be revealed?” I frankly confess I do not know what he means. I will
nevertheless mention such conjectures as I have heard or read.</p>
<p>Some think that the Apostle Paul referred to the Roman empire, and that he was unwilling
to use language more explicit, lest he should incur the calumnious charge of wishing ill
to the empire which it was hoped would be eternal; so that in saying, “For the mystery of
iniquity doth already work,” he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be as the
deeds of Antichrist. And hence some suppose that he shall rise again and be Antichrist.
Others, again, suppose that he is not even dead, but that he was concealed that he might be
supposed to have been killed, and that he now lives in concealment in the vigor of that same
age which he had reached when he was believed to have perished, and will live until he is

revealed in his own time and restored to his kingdom.1406 But I wonder that men can be
so audacious in their conjectures. However, it is not absurd to believe that these words of
the apostle, “Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way,” refer
to the Roman empire, as if it were said, “Only he who now reigneth, let him reign until he
be taken out of the way.” “And then shall the wicked be revealed:” no one doubts that this
means Antichrist. But others think that the words, “Ye know what withholdeth,” and “The
mystery of iniquity worketh,” refer only to the wicked and the hypocrites who are in the
Church, until they reach a number so great as to furnish Antichrist with a great people, and
that this is the mystery of iniquity, because it seems hidden; also that the apostle is exhorting
the faithful tenaciously to hold the faith they hold when he says, “Only he who now holdeth,
let him hold until he be taken out of the way,” that is, until the mystery of iniquity which
now is hidden departs from the Church. For they suppose that it is to this same mystery
John alludes when in his epistle he says, “Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have
heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know
that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been
of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.”1407 As therefore there went out from
the Church many heretics, whom John calls “many antichrists,” at that time prior to the
end, and which John calls “the last time,” so in the end they shall go out who do not belong
to Christ, but to that last Antichrist, and then he shall be revealed.</p>
<p>Thus various, then, are the conjectural explanations of the obscure words of the apostle.
That which there is no doubt he said is this, that Christ will not come to judge quick and
dead unless Antichrist, His adversary, first come to seduce those who are dead in soul; although
their seduction is a result of God’s secret judgment already passed. For, as it is said
“his presence shall be after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
and with all seduction of unrighteousness in them that perish.” For then shall Satan be
loosed, and by means of that Antichrist shall work with all power in a lying though a wonderful
manner. It is commonly questioned whether these works are called “signs and lying
wonders” because he is to deceive men’s senses by false appearances, or because the things
he does, though they be true prodigies, shall be a lie to those who shall believe that such
things could be done only by God, being ignorant of the devil’s power, and especially of
such unexampled power as he shall then for the first time put forth. For when he fell from
heaven as fire, and at a stroke swept away from the holy Job his numerous household and
his vast flocks, and then as a whirlwind rushed upon and smote the house and killed his
children, these were not deceitful appearances, and yet they were the works of Satan to
whom God had given this power. Why they are called signs and lying wonders, we shall
<note type="footnote">1406 Suetonius’ Nero, c. 57.</note>
<note type="footnote">1407 1 John ii. 18, 19.</note>

<pb n="998"/>
then be more likely to know when the time itself arrives. But whatever be the reason of the
name, they shall be such signs and wonders as shall seduce those who shall deserve to be
seduced, “because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved.” Neither
did the apostle scruple to go on to say, “For this cause God shall send upon them the working
of error that they should believe a lie.” For God shall send, because God shall permit the
devil to do these things, the permission being by His own just judgment, though the doing
of them is in pursuance of the devil’s unrighteous and malignant purpose, “that they all
might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” Therefore,
being judged, they shall be seduced, and, being seduced, they shall be judged. But, being
judged, they shall be seduced by those secretly just and justly secret judgments of God, with
which He has never ceased to judge since the first sin of the rational creatures; and, being
seduced, they shall be judged in that last and manifest judgment administered by Jesus
Christ, who was Himself most unjustly judged and shall most justly judge.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—What the Same Apostle Taught in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians
Regarding the Resurrection of the Dead.</head>
<p>But the apostle has said nothing here regarding the resurrection of the dead; but in his
first Epistle to the Thessalonians he says, “We would not have you to be ignorant brethren,
concerning them which are asleep,”1408 etc. These words of the apostle most distinctly
proclaim the future resurrection of the dead, when the Lord Christ shall come to judge the
quick and the dead.</p>
<p>But it is commonly asked whether those whom our Lord shall find alive upon earth,
personated in this passage by the apostle and those who were alive with him, shall never die
at all, or shall pass with incomprehensible swiftness through death to immortality in the
very moment during which they shall be caught up along with those who rise again to meet
the Lord in the air? For we cannot say that it is impossible that they should both die and
revive again while they are carried aloft through the air. For the words, “And so shall we
ever be with the Lord,” are not to be understood as if he meant that we shall always remain
in the air with the Lord; for He Himself shall not remain there, but shall only pass through
it as He comes. For we shall go to meet Him as He comes, not where He remains; but “so
shall we be with the Lord,” that is, we shall be with Him possessed of immortal bodies
wherever we shall be with Him. We seem compelled to take the words in this sense, and to
suppose that those whom the Lord shall find alive upon earth shall in that brief space both
suffer death and receive immortality: for this same apostle says, “In Christ shall all be made
alive;”1409 while, speaking of the same resurrection of the body, he elsewhere says, “That
which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.”1410 How, then, shall those whom Christ
shall find alive upon earth be made alive to immortality in Him if they die not, since on this
very account it is said, “That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die?” Or if we
cannot properly speak of human bodies as sown, unless in so far as by dying they do in some
sort return to the earth, as also the sentence pronounced by God against the sinning father
of the human race runs, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,”1411 we must
acknowledge that those whom Christ at His coming shall find still in the body are not included
in these words of the apostle nor in those of Genesis; for, being caught up into the
clouds, they are certainly not sown, neither going nor returning to the earth, whether they
experience no death at all or die for a moment in the air.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, there meets us the saying of the same apostle when he was
speaking to the Corinthians about the resurrection of the body, “We shall all rise,” or, as

<pb n="1000"/>
other mss. read, “We shall all sleep.”1412 Since, then, there can be no resurrection unless
death has preceded, and since we can in this passage understand by sleep nothing else than
death, how shall all either sleep or rise again if so many persons whom Christ shall find in
the body shall neither sleep nor rise again? If, then, we believe that the saints who shall be
found alive at Christ’s coming, and shall be caught up to meet Him, shall in that same ascent
pass from mortal to immortal bodies, we shall find no difficulty in the words of the apostle,
either when he says, “That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die,” or when he
says, “We shall all rise,” or “all sleep,” for not even the saints shall be quickened to immortality
unless they first die, however briefly; and consequently they shall not be exempt from
resurrection which is preceded by sleep, however brief. And why should it seem to us incredible
that that multitude of bodies should be, as it were, sown in the air, and should in
the air forthwith revive immortal and incorruptible, when we believe, on the testimony of
the same apostle, that the resurrection shall take place in the twinkling of an eye, and that
the dust of bodies long dead shall return with incomprehensible facility and swiftness to
those members that are now to live endlessly? Neither do we suppose that in the case of
these saints the sentence, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,” is null, though
their bodies do not, on dying, fall to earth, but both die and rise again at once while caught
up into the air. For “Thou shalt return to earth” means, Thou shalt at death return to that
which thou wert before life began. Thou shalt, when examinate, be that which thou wert
before thou wast animate. For it was into a face of earth that God breathed the breath of
life when man was made a living soul; as if it were said, Thou art earth with a soul, which
thou wast not; thou shalt be earth without a soul, as thou wast. And this is what all bodies
of the dead are before they rot; and what the bodies of those saints shall be if they die, no
matter where they die, as soon as they shall give up that life which they are immediately to
receive back again. In this way, then, they return or go to earth, inasmuch as from being
living men they shall be earth, as that which becomes cinder is said to go to cinder; that
which decays, to go to decay; and so of six hundred other things. But the manner in which
this shall take place we can now only feebly conjecture, and shall understand it only when
it comes to pass. For that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the dead when Christ comes
to judge quick and dead, we must believe if we would be Christians. But if we are unable
perfectly to comprehend the manner in which it shall take place, our faith is not on this account
vain. Now, however, we ought, as we formerly promised, to show, as far as seems
necessary, what the ancient prophetic books predicted concerning this final judgment of
God; and I fancy no great time need be spent in discussing and explaining these predictions,
if the reader has been careful to avail himself of the help we have already furnished.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Utterances of the Prophet Isaiah Regarding the Resurrection of the
Dead and the Retributive Judgment.</head>
<p>The prophet Isaiah says, “The dead shall rise again, and all who were in the graves shall
rise again; and all who are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is their
health, and the earth of the wicked shall fall.”1413 All the former part of this passage relates
to the resurrection of the blessed; but the words, “the earth of the wicked shall fall,” is rightly
understood as meaning that the bodies of the wicked shall fall into the ruin of damnation.
And if we would more exactly and carefully scrutinize the words which refer to the resurrection
of the good, we may refer to the first resurrection the words, “the dead shall rise again,”
and to the second the following words, “and all who were in the graves shall rise again.”
And if we ask what relates to those saints whom the Lord at His coming shall find alive upon
earth, the following clause may suitably be referred to them; “All who are in the earth shall
rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is their health.” By “health” in this place it is best
to understand immortality. For that is the most perfect health which is not repaired by
nourishment as by a daily remedy. In like manner the same prophet, affording hope to the
good and terrifying the wicked regarding the day of judgment, says, “Thus saith the Lord,
Behold, I will flow down upon them as a river of peace, and upon the glory of the Gentiles
as a rushing torrent; their sons shall be carried on the shoulders, and shall be comforted on
the knees. As one whom his mother comforteth, so shall I comfort you; and ye shall be
comforted in Jerusalem. And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall
rise up like a herb; and the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers, and He
shall threaten the contumacious. For, behold, the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind
His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire.
For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many
shall be wounded by the Lord.”1414 In His promise to the good he says that He will flow
down as a river of peace, that is to say, in the greatest possible abundance of peace. With
this peace we shall in the end be refreshed; but of this we have spoken abundantly in the
preceding book. It is this river in which he says He shall flow down upon those to whom
He promises so great happiness, that we may understand that in the region of that felicity,
which is in heaven, all things are satisfied from this river. But because there shall thence
flow, even upon earthly bodies, the peace of incorruption and immortality, therefore he says
that He shall flow down as this river, that He may as it were pour Himself from things above
to things beneath, and make men the equals of the angels. By “Jerusalem,” too, we should
understand not that which serves with her children, but that which, according to the apostle,
<note type="footnote">1413 Isa. xxvi. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">1414 Isa. lxvi. 12, 16.</note>

<pb n="1002"/>
is our free mother, eternal in the heavens.1415 In her we shall be comforted as we pass toilworn
from earth’s cares and calamities, and be taken up as her children on her knees and
shoulders. Inexperienced and new to such blandishments, we shall be received into unwonted
bliss. There we shall see, and our heart shall rejoice. He does not say what we shall see; but
what but God, that the promise in the Gospel may be fulfilled in us, “Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God?”1416 What shall we see but all those things which now we
see not, but believe in, and of which the idea we form, according to our feeble capacity, is
incomparably less than the reality? “And ye shall see,” he says, “and your heart shall rejoice.”
Here ye believe, there ye shall see.</p>
<p>But because he said, “Your heart shall rejoice,” lest we should suppose that the blessings
of that Jerusalem are only spiritual, he adds, “And your bones shall rise up like a herb,” alluding
to the resurrection of the body, and as it were supplying an omission he had made.
For it will not take place when we have seen; but we shall see when it has taken place. For
he had already spoken of the new heavens and the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under
many figures, of the things promised to the saints, and saying,“There shall be new heavens,
and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind; but they
shall find in it gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an exultation, and
my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and the voice of
weeping shall be no more heard in her;”1417 and other promises, which some endeavor to
refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative
and literal expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful and
salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated
and undisciplined mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is nothing
beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough regarding the style of those prophetic expressions
just quoted. And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said, “And
your bones shall rise up like a herb,” in order to show that it was the resurrection of the
good, though a bodily resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, “And the hand of the
Lord shall be known by His worshippers.” What is this but the hand of Him who distinguishes
those who worship from those who despise Him? Regarding these the context immediately
adds, “And He shall threaten the contumacious,” or, as another translator has it,
“the unbelieving.” He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which are now uttered
shall then be fulfilled in effect. “For behold,” he says, “the Lord shall come as a fire, and as
a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame
of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword:
<note type="footnote">1415 Gal. iv. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">1416 Matt. v. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">1417 Isa. lxv. 17–19.</note>

<pb n="1003"/>
many shall be wounded by the Lord.” By fire, whirlwind, sword, he means the judicial
punishment of God. For he says that the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is
to say, to whom His coming shall be penal. By His chariots (for the word is plural) we
suitably understand the ministration of angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the
earth shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand the spiritual and holy
to be included, but the earthly and carnal, of whom it is said that they “mind earthly
things,”1418 and “to be carnally minded is death,”1419 and whom the Lord calls simply flesh
when He says, “My Spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.”1420 As
to the words, “Many shall be wounded by the Lord,” this wounding shall produce the second
death. It is possible, indeed, to understand fire, sword, and wound in a good sense. For the
Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.1421 And the cloven tongues appeared
to them as fire when the Holy Spirit came.1422 And our Lord says, “I am not come to send
peace on earth, but a sword.”1423 And Scripture says that the word of God is a doubly sharp
sword,1424 on account of the two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs the
holy Church says that she is wounded with love,1425—pierced, as it were, with the arrow of
love. But here, where we read or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is
obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.</p>
<p>After briefly mentioning those who shall be consumed in this judgment, speaking of
the wicked and sinners under the figure of the meats forbidden by the old law, from which
they had not abstained, he summarily recounts the grace of the new testament, from the
first coming of the Saviour to the last judgment, of which we now speak; and herewith he
concludes his prophecy. For he relates that the Lord declares that He is coming to gather
all nations, that they may come and witness His glory.1426 For, as the apostle says, “All have
sinned and are in want of the glory of God.”1427 And he says that He will do wonders among
them, at which they shall marvel and believe in Him; and that from them He will send forth
those that are saved into various nations, and distant islands which have not heard His name
nor seen His glory, and that they shall declare His glory among the nations, and shall bring

the brethren of those to whom the prophet was speaking, i.e., shall bring to the faith under
God the Father the brethren of the elect Israelites; and that they shall bring from all nations
an offering to the Lord on beasts of burden and waggons (which are understood to mean
the aids furnished by God in the shape of angelic or human ministry), to the holy city Jerusalem,
which at present is scattered over the earth, in the faithful saints. For where divine
aid is given, men believe, and where they believe, they come. And the Lord compared them,
in a figure, to the children of Israel offering sacrifice to Him in His house with psalms, which
is already everywhere done by the Church; and He promised that from among them He
would choose for Himself priests and Levites, which also we see already accomplished. For
we see that priests and Levites are now chosen, not from a certain family and blood, as was
originally the rule in the priesthood according to the order of Aaron, but as befits the new
testament, under which Christ is the High Priest after the order of Melchisedec, in consideration
of the merit which is bestowed upon each man by divine grace. And these priests
are not to be judged by their mere title, which is often borne by unworthy men, but by that
holiness which is not common to good men and bad.</p>
<p>After having thus spoken of this mercy of God which is now experienced by the Church,
and is very evident and familiar to us, he foretells also the ends to which men shall come
when the last judgment has separated the good and the bad, saying by the prophet, or the
prophet himself speaking for God, “For as the new heavens and the new earth shall remain
before me, said the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain, and there shall be to
them month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath. All flesh shall come to worship before
me in Jerusalem, said the Lord. And they shall go out, and shall see the members of the
men who have sinned against me: their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be
quenched; and they shall be for a spectacle to all flesh.”1428 At this point the prophet closed
his book, as at this point the world shall come to an end. Some, indeed, have translated
“carcases”1429 instead of “members of the men,” meaning by carcases the manifest punishment
of the body, although carcase is commonly used only of dead flesh, while the bodies
here spoken of shall be animated, else they could not be sensible of any pain; but perhaps
they may, without absurdity, be called carcases, as being the bodies of those who are to fall
into the second death. And for the same reason it is said, as I have already quoted, by this
same prophet, “The earth of the wicked shall fall.”1430 It is obvious that those translators
who use a different word for men do not mean to include only males, for no one will say
that the women who sinned shall not appear in that judgment; but the male sex, being the

more worthy, and that from which the woman was derived, is intended to include both
sexes. But that which is especially pertinent to our subject is this, that since the words “All
flesh shall come,” apply to the good, for the people of God shall be composed of every race
of men,—for all men shall not be present, since the greater part shall be in punishment,—but,
as I was saying, since flesh is used of the good, and members or carcases of the bad, certainly
it is thus put beyond a doubt that that judgment in which the good and the bad shall be allotted
to their destinies shall take place after the resurrection of the body, our faith in which
is thoroughly established by the use of these words.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—What is Meant by the Good Going Out to See the Punishment of the
Wicked.</head>
<p>But in what way shall the good go out to see the punishment of the wicked? Are they
to leave their happy abodes by a bodily movement, and proceed to the places of punishment,
so as to witness the torments of the wicked in their bodily presence? Certainly not; but they
shall go out by knowledge. For this expression, go out, signifies that those who shall be
punished shall be without. And thus the Lord also calls these places “the outer darkness,”1431
to which is opposed that entrance concerning which it is said to the good servant, “Enter
into the joy of thy Lord,” that it may not be supposed that the wicked can enter thither and
be known, but rather that the good by their knowledge go out to them, because the good
are to know that which is without. For those who shall be in torment shall not know what
is going on within in the joy of the Lord; but they who shall enter into that joy shall know
what is going on outside in the outer darkness. Therefore it is said, “They shall go out,”
because they shall know what is done by those who are without. For if the prophets were
able to know things that had not yet happened, by means of that indwelling of God in their
minds, limited though it was, shall not the immortal saints know things that have already
happened, when God shall be all in all?1432 The seed, then, and the name of the saints shall
remain in that blessedness,—the seed, to wit, of which John says, “And his seed remaineth
in him;”1433 and the name, of which it was said through Isaiah himself, “I will give them an
everlasting name.”1434 “And there shall be to them month after month, and Sabbath after
Sabbath,” as if it were said, Moon after moon, and rest upon rest, both of which they shall
themselves be when they shall pass from the old shadows of time into the new lights of
eternity. The worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched, which constitute the
punishment of the wicked, are differently interpreted by different people. For some refer
both to the body, others refer both to the soul; while others again refer the fire literally to
the body, and the worm figuratively to the soul, which seems the more credible idea. But
the present is not the time to discuss this difference, for we have undertaken to occupy this
book with the last judgment, in which the good and the bad are separated: their rewards
and punishments we shall more carefully discuss elsewhere.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—What Daniel Predicted Regarding the Persecution of Antichrist, the
Judgment of God, and the Kingdom of the Saints.</head>
<p>Daniel prophesies of the last judgment in such a way as to indicate that Antichrist shall
first come, and to carry on his description to the eternal reign of the saints. For when in
prophetic vision he had seen four beasts, signifying four kingdoms, and the fourth conquered
by a certain king, who is recognized as Antichrist, and after this the eternal kingdom of the
Son of man, that is to say, of Christ, he says, “My spirit was terrified, I Daniel in the midst
of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me,”1435 etc. Some have interpreted these
four kingdoms as signifying those of the Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians, and Romans.
They who desire to understand the fitness of this interpretation may read Jerome’s book on
Daniel, which is written with a sufficiency of care and erudition. But he who reads this
passage, even half asleep, cannot fail to see that the kingdom of Antichrist shall fiercely,
though for a short time, assail the Church before the last judgment of God shall introduce
the eternal reign of the saints. For it is patent from the context that the time, times, and half
a time, means a year, and two years, and half a year, that is to say, three years and a half.
Sometimes in Scripture the same thing is indicated by months. For though the word times
seems to be used here in the Latin indefinitely, that is only because the Latins have no dual,
as the Greeks have, and as the Hebrews also are said to have. Times, therefore, is used for
two times. As for the ten kings, whom, as it seems, Antichrist is to find in the person of ten
individuals when he comes, I own I am afraid we may be deceived in this, and that he may
come unexpectedly while there are not ten kings living in the Roman world. For what if
this number ten signifies the whole number of kings who are to precede his coming, as totality
is frequently symbolized by a thousand, or a hundred, or seven, or other numbers,
which it is not necessary to recount?</p>
<p>In another place the same Daniel says, “And there shall be a time of trouble, such as
was not since there was born a nation upon earth until that time: and in that time all Thy
people which shall be found written in the book shall be delivered. And many of them that
sleep in the mound of earth shall arise, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
everlasting confusion. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
and many of the just as the stars for ever.”1436 This passage is very similar to the one we
have quoted from the Gospel,1437 at least so far as regards the resurrection of dead bodies.
For those who are there said to be “in the graves” are here spoken of as “sleeping in the
mound of earth,” or, as others translate, “in the dust of earth.” There it is said, “They shall
come forth;” so here, “They shall arise.” There, “They that have done good, to the resurrec-

tion of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment;” here, “Some to
everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting confusion.” Neither is it to be supposed
a difference, though in place of the expression in the Gospel, “All who are in their graves,”
the prophet does not say “all,” but “many of them that sleep in the mound of earth.” For
many is sometimes used in Scripture for all. Thus it was said to Abraham, “I have set thee
as the father of many nations,” though in another place it was said to him, “In thy seed shall
all nations be blessed.”1438 Of such a resurrection it is said a little afterwards to the prophet
himself, “And come thou and rest: for there is yet a day till the completion of the consummation;
and thou shall rest, and rise in thy lot in the end of the days.”1439</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Passages from the Psalms of David Which Predict the End of the World
and the Last Judgment.</head>
<p>There are many allusions to the last judgment in the Psalms, but for the most part only
casual and slight. I cannot, however, omit to mention what is said there in express terms
of the end of this world: “In the beginning hast Thou laid the foundations of the earth, O
Lord; and the heavens are the work of Thy hands. They shall perish, but Thou shall endure;
yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; and as a vesture Thou shall change them, and
they shall be changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.”1440 Why is it
that Porphyry, while he lauds the piety of the Hebrews in worshipping a God great and true,
and terrible to the gods themselves, follows the oracles of these gods in accusing the Christians
of extreme folly because they say that this world shall perish? For here we find it said
in the sacred books of the Hebrews, to that God whom this great philosopher acknowledges
to be terrible even to the gods themselves, “The heavens are the work of Thy hands; they
shall perish.” When the heavens, the higher and more secure part of the world, perish, shall
the world itself be preserved? If this idea is not relished by Jupiter, whose oracle is quoted
by this philosopher as an unquestionable authority in rebuke of the credulity of the Christians,
why does he not similarly rebuke the wisdom of the Hebrews as folly, seeing that the prediction
is found in their most holy books? But if this Hebrew wisdom, with which Porphyry
is so captivated that he extols it through the utterances of his own gods, proclaims that the
heavens are to perish, how is he so infatuated as to detest the faith of the Christians partly,
if not chiefly, on this account, that they believe the world is to perish?—though how the
heavens are to perish if the world does not is not easy to see. And, indeed, in the sacred
writings which are peculiar to ourselves, and not common to the Hebrews and us,—I mean
the evangelic and apostolic books,—the following expressions are used: “The figure of this
world passeth away;”1441 “The world passeth away;”1442 “Heaven and earth shall pass
away,”1443—expressions which are, I fancy, somewhat milder than “They shall perish.” In
the Epistle of the Apostle Peter, too, where the world which then was is said to have perished,
being overflowed with water, it is sufficiently obvious what part of the world is signified by
the whole, and in what sense the word perished is to be taken, and what heavens were kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.1444
And when he says a little afterwards, “The day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which
the heavens shall pass away with a great rush, and the elements shall melt with burning heat,

<pb n="1010"/>
and the earth and the works which are in it shall be burned up and then adds, “Seeing, then,
that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be?”1445—these
heavens which are to perish may be understood to be the same which he said were kept in
store reserved for fire; and the elements which are to be burned are those which are full of
storm and disturbance in this lowest part of the world in which he said that these heavens
were kept in store; for the higher heavens in whose firmament are set the stars are safe, and
remain in their integrity. For even the expression of Scripture, that “the stars shall fall from
heaven,”1446 not to mention that a different interpretation is much preferable, rather shows
that the heavens themselves shall remain, if the stars are to fall from them. This expression,
then, is either figurative, as is more credible, or this phenomenon will take place in this
lowest heaven, like that mentioned by Virgil,—
<lg>
<l>“A meteor with a train of light</l>
<l>Athwart the sky gleamed dazzling bright,</l>
<l>Then in Idæan woods was lost.”1447</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But the passage I have quoted from the psalm seems to except none of the heavens from
the destiny of destruction; for he says, “The heavens are the works of Thy hands: they shall
perish;” so that, as none of them are excepted from the category of God’s works, none of
them are excepted from destruction. For our opponents will not condescend to defend the
Hebrew piety, which has won the approbation of their gods, by the words of the Apostle
Peter, whom they vehemently detest; nor will they argue that, as the apostle in his epistle
understands a part when he speaks of the whole world perishing in the flood, though only
the lowest part of it, and the corresponding heavens were destroyed, so in the psalm the
whole is used for a part, and it is said “They shall perish,” though only the lowest heavens
are to perish. But since, as I said, they will not condescend to reason thus, lest they should
seem to approve of Peter’s meaning, or ascribe as much importance to the final conflagration
as we ascribe to the deluge, whereas they contend that no waters or flames could destroy
the whole human race, it only remains to them to maintain that their gods lauded the wisdom
of the Hebrews because they had not read this psalm.</p>
<p>It is the last judgment of God which is re ferred to also in the 50th Psalm in the words,
“God shall come manifestly, our God, and shall not keep silence: fire shall devour before
Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall call the heaven above,
and the earth, to judge His people. Gather His saints together to Him; they who make a
covenant with Him over sacrifices.”1448 This we understand of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom

we look for from heaven to judge the quick and the dead. For He shall come manifestly to
judge justly the just and the unjust, who before came hiddenly to be unjustly judged by the
unjust. He, I say, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence, that is, shall make
Himself known by His voice of judgment, who before, when he came hiddenly, was silent
before His judge when He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and, as a lamb before the
shearer, opened not His mouth as we read that it was prophesied of Him by Isaiah,1449 and
as we see it fulfilled in the Gospel.1450 As for the fire and tempest, we have already said how
these are to be interpreted when we were explaining a similar passage in Isaiah.1451 As to
the expression, “He shall call the heaven above,” as the saints and the righteous are rightly
called heaven, no doubt this means what the apostle says, “We shall be caught up together
with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.”1452 For if we take the bare literal sense,
how is it possible to call the heaven above, as if the heaven could be anywhere else than
above? And the following expression, “And the earth to judge His people,” if we supply
only the words, “He shall call,” that is to say, “He shall call the earth also,” and do not supply
“above,” seems to give us a meaning in accordance with sound doctrine, the heaven symbolizing
those who will judge along with Christ, and the earth those who shall be judged; and
thus the words, “He shall call the heaven above,” would not mean, “He shall catch up into
the air,” but “He shall lift up to seats of judgment.” Possibly, too, “He shall call the heaven,”
may mean, He shall call the angels in the high and lofty places, that He may descend with
them to do judgment; and “He shall call the earth also” would then mean, He shall call the
men on the earth to judgment. But if with the words “and the earth” we understand not
only “He shall call,” but also “above,” so as to make the full sense be, He shall call the heaven
above, and He shall call the earth above, then I think it is best understood of the men who
shall be caught up to meet Christ in the air, and that they are called the heaven with reference
to their souls, and the earth with reference to their bodies. Then what is “to judge His
people,” but to separate by judgment the good from the bad, as the sheep from the goats?
Then he turns to address the angels: “Gather His saints together unto Him.” For certainly
a matter so important must be accomplished by the ministry of angels. And if we ask who
the saints are who are gathered unto Him by the angels, we are told, “They who make a
covenant with Him over sacrifices.” This is the whole life of the saints, to make a covenant
with God over sacrifices. For “over sacrifices” either refers to works of mercy, which are
preferable to sacrifices in the judgment of God, who says, “I desire mercy more than sacrifices,”
1453 or if “over sacrifices” means in sacrifices, then these very works of mercy are the

sacrifices with which God is pleased, as I remember to have stated in the tenth book of this
work;1454 and in these works the saints make a covenant with God, because they do them
for the sake of the promises which are contained in His new testament or covenant. And
hence, when His saints have been gathered to Him and set at His right hand in the last
judgment, Christ shall say, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave me to
eat,”1455 and so on, mentioning the good works of the good, and their eternal rewards assigned
by the last sentence of the Judge.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Of Malachi’s Prophecy, in Which He Speaks of the Last Judgment,
and of a Cleansing Which Some are to Undergo by Purifying Punishments.</head>
<p>The prophet Malachi or Malachias, who is also called Angel, and is by some (for
Jerome1456 tells us that this is the opinion of the Hebrews) identified with Ezra the priest,1457
others of whose writings have been received into the canon, predicts the last judgment,
saying, “Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty; and who shall abide the day of His
entrance? . . . for I am the Lord your God, and I change not.”1458 From these words it more
evidently appears that some shall in the last judgment suffer some kind of purgatorial punishments;
for what else can be understood by the word, “Who shall abide the day of His
entrance, or who shall be able to look upon Him? for He enters as a moulder’s fire, and as
the herb of fullers: and He shall sit fusing and purifying as if over gold and silver: and He
shall purify the sons of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver?” Similarly Isaiah says,
“The Lord shall wash the filthiness of the sons and daughters of Zion, and shall cleanse away
the blood from their midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.”1459
Unless perhaps we should say that they are cleansed from filthiness and in a manner clarified,
when the wicked are separated from them by penal judgment, so that the elimination and
damnation of the one party is the purgation of the others, because they shall henceforth live
free from the contamination of such men. But when he says, “And he shall purify the sons
of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver, and they shall offer to the Lord sacrifices in
righteousness; and the sacrifices of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord,” he
declares that those who shall be purified shall then please the Lord with sacrifices of righteousness,
and consequently they themselves shall be purified from their own unrighteousness
which made them displeasing to God. Now they themselves, when they have been purified,
shall be sacrifices of complete and perfect righteousness; for what more acceptable offering
can such persons make to God than themselves? But this question of purgatorial punishments
we must defer to another time, to give it a more adequate treatment. By the sons of Levi
and Judah and Jerusalem we ought to understand the Church herself, gathered not from
the Hebrews only, but from other nations as well; nor such a Church as she now is, when
“if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,”1460 but as
she shall then be, purged by the last judgment as a threshing-floor by a winnowing wind,
and those of her members who need it being cleansed by fire, so that there remains absolutely
not one who offers sacrifice for his sins. For all who make such offerings are assuredly in

<head>Chapter 26.—Of the Sacrifices Offered to God by the Saints, Which are to Be Pleasing
to Him, as in the Primitive Days and Former Years.</head>
<p>And it was with the design of showing that His city shall not then follow this custom,
that God said that the sons of Levi should offer sacrifices in righteousness,—not therefore
in sin, and consequently not for sin. And hence we see how vainly the Jews promise themselves
a return of the old times of sacrificing according to the law of the old testament,
grounding on the words which follow, “And the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem shall be
pleasing to the Lord, as in the primitive days, and as in former years.” For in the times of
the law they offered sacrifices not in righteousness but in sins, offering especially and
primarily for sins, so much so that even the priest himself, whom we must suppose to have
been their most righteous man, was accustomed to offer, according to God’s commandments,
first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. And therefore we must explain
how we are to understand the words, “as in the primitive days, and as in former years;” for
perhaps he alludes to the time in which our first parents were in paradise. Then, indeed,
intact and pure from all stain and blemish of sin, they offered themselves to God as the
purest sacrifices. But since they were banished thence on account of their transgression,
and human nature was condemned in them, with the exception of the one Mediator and
those who have been baptized, and are as yet infants, “there is none clean from stain, not
even the babe whose life has been but for a day upon the earth.”1461 But if it be replied that
those who offer in faith may be said to offer in righteousness, because the righteous lives by
faith,1462—he deceives himself, however, if he says that he has no sin, and therefore he does
not say so, because he lives by faith,—will any man say this time of faith can be placed on
an equal footing with that consummation when they who offer sacrifices in righteousness
shall be purified by the fire of the last judgment? And consequently, since it must be believed
that after such a cleansing the righteous shall retain no sin, assuredly that time, so far as regards
its freedom from sin, can be compared to no other period, unless to that during which
our first parents lived in paradise in the most innocent happiness before their transgression.
It is this period, then, which is properly understood when it is said, “as in the primitive days,
and as in former years.” For in Isaiah, too, after the new heavens and the new earth have
been promised, among other elements in the blessedness of the saints which are there depicted
by allegories and figures, from giving an adequate explanation of which I am prevented
by a desire to avoid prolixity, it is said, “According to the days of the tree of life shall be the
<note type="footnote">1461 Job. xiv. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1462 Rom. i. 17.</note>

<pb n="1016"/>
days of my people.”1463 And who that has looked at Scripture does not know where God
planted the tree of life, from whose fruit He excluded our first parents when their own
iniquity ejected them from paradise, and round which a terrible and fiery fence was set?</p>
<p>But if any one contends that those days of the tree of life mentioned by the prophet
Isaiah are the present times of the Church of Christ, and that Christ Himself is prophetically
called the Tree of Life, because He is Wisdom, and of wisdom Solomon says, “It is a tree of
life to all who embrace it;”1464 and if they maintain that our first parents did not pass years
in paradise, but were driven from it so soon that none of their children were begotten there,
and that therefore that time cannot be alluded to in words which run, “as in the primitive
days, and as in former years,” I forbear entering on this question, lest by discussing everything
I become prolix, and leave the whole subject in uncertainty. For I see another meaning,
which should keep us from believing that a restoration of the primitive days and former
years of the legal sacrifices could have been promised to us by the prophet as a great boon.
For the animals selected as victims under the old law were required to be immaculate, and
free from all blemish whatever, and symbolized holy men free from all sin, the only instance
of which character was found in Christ. As, therefore, after the judgment those who are
worthy of such purification shall be purified even by fire, and shall be rendered thoroughly
sinless, and shall offer themselves to God in righteousness, and be indeed victims immaculate
and free from all blemish whatever, they shall then certainly be, “as in the primitive days,
and as in former years,” when the purest victims were offered, the shadow of this future
reality. For there shall then be in the body and soul of the saints the purity which was
symbolized in the bodies of these victims.</p>
<p>Then, with reference to those who are worthy not of cleansing but of damnation, He
says, “And I will draw near to you to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against evildoers
and against adulterers;” and after enumerating other damnable crimes, He adds, “For I am
the Lord your God, and I am not changed.” It is as if He said, Though your fault has changed
you for the worse, and my grace has changed you for the better, I am not changed. And he
says that He Himself will be a witness, because in His judgment He needs no witnesses; and
that He will be “swift,” either because He is to come suddenly, and the judgment which
seemed to lag shall be very swift by His unexpected arrival, or because He will convince the
consciences of men directly and without any prolix harangue. “For,” as it is written, “in the
thoughts of the wicked His examination shall be conducted.”1465 And the apostle says, “The
thoughts accusing or else excusing, in the day in which God shall judge the hidden things
of men, according to my gospel in Jesus Christ.”1466 Thus, then, shall the Lord be a swift

<head>Chapter 28.—That the Law of Moses Must Be Spiritually Understood to Preclude
the Damnable Murmurs of a Carnal Interpretation.</head>
<p>In the succeeding words, “Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
to him in Horeb for all Israel,”1468 the prophet opportunely mentions precepts and statutes,
after declaring the important distinction hereafter to be made between those who observe
and those who despise the law. He intends also that they learn to interpret the law spiritually,
and find Christ in it, by whose judgment that separation between the good and the bad is
to be made. For it is not without reason that the Lord Himself says to the Jews, “Had ye
believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.”1469 For by receiving the
law carnally without perceiving that its earthly promises were figures of things spiritual,
they fell into such murmur ings as audaciously to say, “It is vain to serve God; and what
profit is it that we have kept His ordinance, and that we have walked suppliantly before the
face of the Lord Almighty? And now we call aliens happy; yea, they that work wickedness
are set up.”1470 It was these words of theirs which in a manner compelled the prophet to
announce the last judgment, in which the wicked shall not even in appearance be happy,
but shall manifestly be most miserable; and in which the good shall be oppressed with not
even a transitory wretchedness, but shall enjoy unsullied and eternal felicity. For he had
previously cited some similar expressions of those who said, “Every one that doeth evil is
good in the sight of the Lord, and such are pleasing to Him.”1471 It was, I say, by understanding
the law of Moses carnally that they had come to murmur thus against God. And
hence, too, the writer of the 73d Psalm says that his feet were almost gone, his steps had
well-nigh slipped, because he was envious of sinners while he considered their prosperity,
so that he said among other things, How doth God know, and is there knowledge in the
Most High? and again, Have I sanctified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency?
1472 He goes on to say that his efforts to solve this most difficult problem, which
arises when the good seem to be wretched and the wicked happy, were in vain until he went
into the sanctuary of God, and understood the last things.1473 For in the last judgment
things shall not be so; but in the manifest felicity of the righteous and manifest misery of
the wicked quite another state of things shall appear.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—Of the Coming of Elias Before the Judgment, that the Jews May Be
Converted to Christ by His Preaching and Explanation of Scripture.</head>
<p>After admonishing them to give heed to the law of Moses, as he foresaw that for a long
time to come they would not understand it spiritually and rightly, he went on to say, “And,
behold, I will send to you Elias the Tishbite before the great and signal day of the Lord come:
and he shall turn the heart of the father to the son, and the heart of a man to his next of kin,
lest I come and utterly smite the earth.”1474 It is a familiar theme in the conversation and
heart of the faithful, that in the last days before the judgment the Jews shall believe in the
true Christ, that is, our Christ, by means of this great and admirable prophet Elias who shall
expound the law to them. For not without reason do we hope that before the coming of
our Judge and Saviour Elias shall come, because we have good reason to believe that he is
now alive; for, as Scripture most distinctly informs us,1475 he was taken up from this life in
a chariot of fire. When, therefore, he is come, he shall give a spiritual explanation of the
law which the Jews at present understand carnally, and shall thus “turn the heart of the
father to the son,” that is, the heart of fathers to their children; for the Septuagint translators
have frequently put the singular for the plural number. And the meaning is, that the sons,
that is, the Jews, shall understand the law as the fathers, that is, the prophets, and among
them Moses himself, understood it. For the heart of the fathers shall be turned to their
children when the children understand the law as their fathers did; and the heart of the
children shall be turned to their fathers when they have the same sentiments as the fathers.
The Septuagint used the expression, “and the heart of a man to his next of kin,” because
fathers and children are eminently neighbors to one another. Another and a preferable
sense can be found in the words of the Septuagint translators, who have translated Scripture
with an eye to prophecy, the sense, viz., that Elias shall turn the heart of God the Father to
the Son, not certainly as if he should bring about this love of the Father for the Son, but
meaning that he should make it known, and that the Jews also, who had previously hated,
should then love the Son who is our Christ. For so far as regards the Jews, God has His
heart turned away from our Christ, this being their conception about God and Christ. But
in their case the heart of God shall be turned to the Son when they themselves shall turn in
heart, and learn the love of the Father towards the Son. The words following, “and the heart
of a man to his next of kin,”—that is, Elias shall also turn the heart of a man to his next of
kin,—how can we understand this better than as the heart of a man to the man Christ? For
though in the form of God He is our God, yet, taking the form of a servant, He condescended
to become also our next of kin. It is this, then, which Elias will do, “lest,” he says, “I come
and smite the earth utterly.” For they who mind earthly things are the earth. Such are the

<head>Chapter 30.—That in the Books of the Old Testament, Where It is Said that God
Shall Judge the World, the Person of Christ is Not Explicitly Indicated, But It
Plainly Appears from Some Passages in Which the Lord God Speaks that Christ
is Meant.</head>
<p>There are many other passages of Scripture bearing on the last judgment of God,—so
many, indeed, that to cite them all would swell this book to an unpardonable size. Suffice
it to have proved that both Old and New Testament enounce the judgment. But in the Old
it is not so definitely declared as in the New that the judgment shall be administered by
Christ, that is, that Christ shall descend from heaven as the Judge; for when it is therein
stated by the Lord God or His prophet that the Lord God shall come, we do not necessarily
understand this of Christ. For both the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are the
Lord God. We must not, however, leave this without proof. And therefore we must first
show how Jesus Christ speaks in the prophetical books under the title of the Lord God, while
yet there can be no doubt that it is Jesus Christ who speaks; so that in other passages where
this is not at once apparent, and where nevertheless it is said that the Lord God will come
to that last judgment, we may understand that Jesus Christ is meant. There is a passage in
the prophet Isaiah which illustrates what I mean. For God says by the prophet, “Hear me,
Jacob and Israel, whom I call. I am the first, and I am for ever: and my hand has founded
the earth, and my right hand has established the heaven. I will call them, and they shall
stand together, and be gathered, and hear. Who has declared to them these things? In love
of thee I have done thy pleasure upon Babylon, that I might take away the seed of the
Chaldeans. I have spoken, and I have called: I have brought him, and have made his way
prosperous. Come ye near unto me, and hear this. I have not spoken in secret from the
beginning; when they were made, there was I. And now the Lord God and His Spirit hath
sent me.”1477 It was Himself who was speaking as the Lord God; and yet we should not
have understood that it was Jesus Christ had He not added, “And now the Lord God and
His Spirit hath sent me.” For He said this with reference to the form of a servant, speaking
of a future event as if it were past, as in the same prophet we read, “He was led as a sheep
to the slaughter,”1478 not “He shall be led;” but the past tense is used to express the future.
And prophecy constantly speaks in this way.</p>
<p>There is also another passage in Zechariah which plainly declares that the Almighty
sent the Almighty; and of what persons can this be understood but of God the Father and
God the Son? For it is written, “Thus saith the Lord Almighty, After the glory hath He sent
me unto the nations which spoiled you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His
<note type="footnote">1477 Isa. xlviii. 12-16.</note>
<note type="footnote">1478 Isa. liii. 7.</note>

<pb n="1023"/>
eye. Behold, I will bring mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants:
and ye shall know that the Lord Almighty hath sent me.”1479 Observe, the Lord Almighty
saith that the Lord Almighty sent Him. Who can presume to understand these words of
any other than Christ, who is speaking to the lost sheep of the house of Israel? For He says
in the Gospel, “I am not sent save to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,”1480 which He
here compared to the pupil of God’s eye, to signify the profoundest love. And to this class
of sheep the apostles themselves belonged. But after the glory, to wit, of His resurrection,—for
before it happened the evangelist said that “Jesus was not yet glorified,”1481—He was sent
unto the nations in the persons of His apostles; and thus the saying of the psalm was fulfilled,
“Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people; Thou wilt set me as the head
of the nations,”1482 so that those who had spoiled the Israelites, and whom the Israelites
had served when they were subdued by them, were not themselves to be spoiled in the same
fashion, but were in their own persons to become the spoil of the Israelites. For this had
been promised to the apostles when the Lord said, “I will make you fishers of men.”1483
And to one of them He says, “From henceforth thou shalt catch men.”1484 They were then
to become a spoil, but in a good sense, as those who are snatched from that strong one when
he is bound by a stronger.1485</p>
<p>In like manner the Lord, speaking by the same prophet, says, “And it shall come to pass
in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I
will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace
and mercy; and they shall look upon me because they have insulted me, and they shall mourn
for Him as for one very dear, and shall be in bitterness as for an only-begotten.”1486 To
whom but to God does it belong to destroy all the nations that are hostile to the holy city
Jerusalem, which “come against it,” that is, are opposed to it, or, as some translate, “come
upon it,” as if putting it down under them; or to pour out upon the house of David and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and mercy? This belongs doubtless to God, and
it is to God the prophet ascribes the words; and yet Christ shows that He is the God who
does these so great and divine things, when He goes on to say, “And they shall look upon
me because they have insulted me, and they shall mourn for Him as if for one very dear (or

beloved), and shall be in bitterness for Him as for an only-begotten.” For in that day the
Jews—those of them, at least, who shall receive the spirit of grace and mercy—when they
see Him coming in His majesty, and recognize that it is He whom they, in the person of
their parents, insulted when He came before in His humiliation, shall repent of insulting
Him in His passion: and their parents themselves, who were the perpetrators of this huge
impiety, shall see Him when they rise; but this will be only for their punishment, and not
for their correction. It is not of them we are to understand the words, “And I will pour upon
the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and mercy,
and they shall look upon me because they have insulted me;” but we are to understand the
words of their descendants, who shall at that time believe through Elias. But as we say to
the Jews, You killed Christ, although it was their parents who did so, so these persons shall
grieve that they in some sort did what their progenitors did. Although, therefore, those that
receive the spirit of mercy and grace, and believe, shall not be condemned with their impious
parents, yet they shall mourn as if they themselves had done what their parents did. Their
grief shall arise not so much from guilt as from pious affection. Certainly the words which
the Septuagint have translated, “They shall look upon me because they insulted me,” stand
in the Hebrew,“They shall look upon me whom they pierced.”1487 And by this word the
crucifixion of Christ is certainly more plainly indicated. But the Septuagint translators
preferred to allude to the insult which was involved in His whole passion. For in point of
fact they insulted Him both when He was arrested and when He was bound, when He was
judged, when He was mocked by the robe they put on Him and the homage they did on
bended knee, when He was crowned with thorns and struck with a rod on the head, when
He bore His cross, and when at last He hung upon the tree. And therefore we recognize
more fully the Lord’s passion when we do not confine ourselves to one interpretation, but
combine both, and read both “insulted” and “pierced.”</p>
<p>When, therefore, we read in the prophetical books that God is to come to do judgment
at the last, from the mere mention of the judgment, and although there is nothing else to
determine the meaning, we must gather that Christ is meant; for though the Father will
judge, He will judge by the coming of the Son. For He Himself, by His own manifested
presence, “judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son;”1488 for as the Son
was judged as a man, He shall also judge in human form. For it is none but He of whom
God speaks by Isaiah under the name of Jacob and Israel, of whose seed Christ took a body,
as it is written, “Jacob is my servant, I will uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, my Spirit has
assumed Him: I have put my Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
He shall not cry, nor cease, neither shall His voice be heard without. A bruised reed shall

He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench: but in truth shall He bring forth
judgment. He shall shine and shall not be broken, until He sets judgment in the earth: and
the nations shall hope in His name.”1489 The Hebrew has not “Jacob” and “Israel;” but the
Septuagint translators, wishing to show the significance of the expression “my servant,” and
that it refers to the form of a servant in which the Most High humbled Himself, inserted
the name of that man from whose stock He took the form of a servant. The Holy Spirit was
given to Him, and was manifested, as the evangelist testifies, in the form of a dove.1490 He
brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, because He predicted what was hidden from them.
In His meekness He did not cry, nor did He cease to proclaim the truth. But His voice was
not heard, nor is it heard, without, because He is not obeyed by those who are outside of
His body. And the Jews themselves, who persecuted Him, He did not break, though as a
bruised reed they had lost their integrity, and as smoking flax their light was quenched; for
He spared them, having come to be judged and not yet to judge. He brought forth judgment
in truth, declaring that they should be punished did they persist in their wickedness. His
face shone on the Mount,1491 His fame in the world. He is not broken nor overcome, because
neither in Himself nor in His Church has persecution prevailed to annihilate Him. And
therefore that has not, and shall not, be brought about which His enemies said or say, “When
shall He die, and His name perish?”1492 “until He set judgment in the earth.” Behold, the
hidden thing which we were seeking is discovered. For this is the last judgment, which He
will set in the earth when He comes from heaven. And it is in Him, too, we already see the
concluding expression of the prophecy fulfilled: “In His name shall the nations hope.” And
by this fulfillment, which no one can deny, men are encouraged to believe in that which is
most impudently denied. For who could have hoped for that which even those who do not
yet believe in Christ now see fulfilled among us, and which is so undeniable that they can
but gnash their teeth and pine away? Who, I say, could have hoped that the nations would
hope in the name of Christ, when He was arrested, bound, scourged, mocked, crucified,
when even the disciples themselves had lost the hope which they had begun to have in Him?
The hope which was then entertained scarcely by the one thief on the cross, is now cherished
by nations everywhere on the earth, who are marked with the sign of the cross on which He
died that they may not die eternally.</p>
<p>That the last judgment, then, shall be administered by Jesus Christ in the manner predicted
in the sacred writings is denied or doubted by no one, unless by those who, through
some incredible animosity or blindness, decline to believe these writings, though already

their truth is demonstrated to all the world. And at or in connection with that judgment
the following events shall come to pass, as we have learned: Elias the Tishbite shall come;
the Jews shall believe; Antichrist shall persecute; Christ shall judge; the dead shall rise; the
good and the wicked shall be separated; the world shall be burned and renewed. All these
things, we believe, shall come to pass; but how, or in what order, human understanding
cannot perfectly teach us, but only the experience of the events themselves. My opinion,
however, is, that they will happen in the order in which I have related them.</p>
<p>Two books yet remain to be written by me, in order to complete, by God’s help, what
I promised. One of these will explain the punishment of the wicked, the other the happiness
of the righteous; and in them I shall be at special pains to refute, by God’s grace, the arguments
by which some unhappy creatures seem to themselves to undermine the divine
promises and threatenings, and to ridicule as empty words statements which are the most
salutary nutriment of faith. But they who are instructed in divine things hold the truth and
omnipotence of God to be the strongest arguments in favor of those things which, however
incredible they seem to men, are yet contained in the Scriptures, whose truth has already
in many ways been proved; for they are sure that God can in no wise lie, and that He can
do what is impossible to the unbelieving.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—Of the Order of the Discussion, Which Requires that We First Speak
of the Eternal Punishment of the Lost in Company with the Devil, and Then of
the Eternal Happiness of the Saints.</head>
<p>I Propose, with such ability as God may grant me, to discuss in this book more thoroughly
the nature of the punishment which shall be assigned to the devil and all his retainers, when
the two cities, the one of God, the other of the devil, shall have reached their proper ends
through Jesus Christ our Lord, the Judge of quick and dead. And I have adopted this order,
and preferred to speak, first of the punishment of the devils, and afterwards of the blessedness
of the saints, because the body partakes of either destiny; and it seems to be more incredible
that bodies endure in everlasting torments than that they continue to exist without any pain
in everlasting felicity. Consequently, when I shall have demonstrated that that punishment
ought not to be incredible, this will materially aid me in proving that which is much more
credible, viz., the immortality of the bodies of the saints which are delivered from all pain.
Neither is this order out of harmony with the divine writings, in which sometimes, indeed,
the blessedness of the good is placed first, as in the words, “They that have done good, unto
the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment;”1493
but sometimes also last, as, “The Son of man shall send forth His angels, and they shall
gather out of His kingdom all things which offend, and shall cast them into a furnace of
fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth, Then shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of His Father;”1494 and that, “These shall go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.”1495 And though we have not room to cite
instances, any one who examines the prophets will find that they adopt now the one arrangement
and now the other. My own reason for following the latter order I have given.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Whether It is Possible for Bodies to Last for Ever in Burning Fire.</head>
<p>What, then, can I adduce to convince those who refuse to believe that human bodies,
animated and living, can not only survive death, but also last in the torments of everlasting
fires? They will not allow us to refer this simply to the power of the Almighty, but demand
that we persuade them by some example. If, then, we reply to them, that there are animals
which certainly are corruptible, because they are mortal, and which yet live in the midst of
flames; and likewise, that in springs of water so hot that no one can put his hand in it with
impunity a species of worm is found, which not only lives there, but cannot live elsewhere;
they either refuse to believe these facts unless we can show them, or, if we are in circumstances
to prove them by ocular demonstration or by adequate testimony, they contend, with the
same scepticism, that these facts are not examples of what we seek to prove, inasmuch as
these animals do not live for ever, and besides, they live in that blaze of heat without pain,
the element of fire being congenial to their nature, and causing it to thrive and not to suffer,—
just as if it were not more incredible that it should thrive than that it should suffer in
such circumstances. It is strange that anything should suffer in fire and yet live, but stranger
that it should live in fire and not suffer. If, then, the latter be believed, why not also the
former?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="1030"/>
<head>Chapter 3.—Whether Bodily Suffering Necessarily Terminates in the Destruction
of the Flesh.</head>
<p>But, say they, there is no body which can suffer and cannot also die. How do we know
this? For who can say with certainty that the devils do not suffer in their bodies, when they
own that they are grievously tormented? And if it is replied that there is no earthly
body—that is to say, no solid and perceptible body, or, in one word, no flesh—which can
suffer and cannot die, is not this to tell us only what men have gathered from experience
and their bodily senses? For they indeed have no acquaintance with any flesh but that which
is mortal; and this is their whole argument, that what they have had no experience of they
judge quite impossible. For we cannot call it reasoning to make pain a presumption of
death, while, in fact, it is rather a sign of life. For though it be a question whether that which
suffers can continue to live for ever, yet it is certain that everything which suffers pain does
live, and that pain can exist only in a living subject. It is necessary, therefore, that he who
is pained be living, not necessary that pain kill him; for every pain does not kill even those
mortal bodies of ours which are destined to die. And that any pain kills them is caused by
the circumstance that the soul is so connected with the body that it succumbs to great pain
and withdraws; for the structure of our members and vital parts is so infirm that it cannot
bear up against that violence which causes great or extreme agony. But in the life to come
this connection of soul and body is of such a kind, that as it is dissolved by no lapse of time,
so neither is it burst asunder by any pain. And so, although it be true that in this world
there is no flesh which can suffer pain and yet cannot die, yet in the world to come there
shall be flesh such as now there is not, as there will also be death such as now there is not.
For death will not be abolished, but will be eternal, since the soul will neither be able to enjoy
God and live, nor to die and escape the pains of the body. The first death drives the soul
from the body against her will: the second death holds the soul in the body against her will.
The two have this in common, that the soul suffers against her will what her own body inflicts.</p>
<p>Our opponents, too, make much of this, that in this world there is no flesh which can
suffer pain and cannot die; while they make nothing of the fact that there is something which
is greater than the body. For the spirit, whose presence animates and rules the body, can
both suffer pain and cannot die. Here then is something which, though it can feel pain, is
immortal. And this capacity, which we now see in the spirit of all, shall be hereafter in the
bodies of the damned. Moreover, if we attend to the matter a little more closely, we see that
what is called bodily pain is rather to be referred to the soul. For it is the soul not the body,
which is pained, even when the pain originates with the body,—the soul feeling pain at the
point where the body is hurt. As then we speak of bodies feeling and living, though the
feeling and life of the body are from the soul, so also we speak of bodies being pained, though
no pain can be suffered by the body apart from the soul. The soul, then, is pained with the
body in that part where something occurs to hurt it; and it is pained alone, though it be in

<pb n="1031"/>
the body, when some invisible cause distresses it, while the body is safe and sound. Even
when not associated with the body it is pained; for certainly that rich man was suffering in
hell when he cried, “I am tormented in this flame.”1496 But as for the body, it suffers no
pain when it is soulless; and even when animate it can suffer only by the soul’s suffering.
If, therefore, we might draw a just presumption from the existence of pain to that of death,
and conclude that where pain can be felt death can occur, death would rather be the property
of the soul, for to it pain more peculiarly belongs. But, seeing that that which suffers most
cannot die, what ground is there for supposing that those bodies, because destined to suffer,
are therefore, destined to die? The Platonists indeed maintained that these earthly bodies
and dying members gave rise to the fears, desires, griefs, and joys of the soul. “Hence,” says
Virgil (i.e., from these earthly bodies and dying members),
<lg>
<l>“Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,</l>
<l>And human laughter, human tears.”1497</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But in the fourteenth book of this work1498 we have proved that, according to the Pla-
tonists’ own theory, souls, even when purged from all pollution of the body, are yet pos
sessed by a monstrous desire to return again into their bodies. But where desire can exist,
certainly pain also can exist; for desire frustrated, either by missing what it aims at or losing
what it had attained, is turned into pain. And therefore, if the soul, which is either the only
or the chief sufferer, has yet a kind of immortality of its own, it is inconsequent to say that
because the bodies of the damned shall suffer pain, therefore they shall die. In fine, if the
body causes the soul to suffer, why can the body not cause death as well as suffering, unless
because it does not follow that what causes pain causes death as well? And why then is it
incredible that these fires can cause pain but not death to those bodies we speak of, just as
the bodies themselves cause pain, but not therefore death, to the souls? Pain is therefore
no necessary presumption of death.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—Examples from Nature Proving that Bodies May Remain Unconsumed
and Alive in Fire.</head>
<p>If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists1499 have recorded, and if certain
famous mountains of Sicily have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until
now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which
burns is not consumed. As the soul too, is a proof that not everything which can suffer pain
can also die, why then do they yet demand that we produce real examples to prove that it
is not incredible that the bodies of men condemned to everlasting punishment may retain
their soul in the fire, may burn without being consumed, and may suffer without perishing?
For suitable properties will be communicated to the substance of the flesh by Him who has
endowed the things we see with so marvellous and diverse properties, that their very multitude
prevents our wonder. For who but God the Creator of all things has given to the flesh
of the peacock its antiseptic property? This property, when I first heard of it, seemed to me
incredible; but it happened at Carthage that a bird of this kind was cooked and served up
to me, and, taking a suitable slice of flesh from its breast, I ordered it to be kept, and when
it had been kept as many days as make any other flesh stinking, it was produced and set
before me, and emitted no offensive smell. And after it had been laid by for thirty days and
more, it was still in the same state; and a year after, the same still, except that it was a little
more shrivelled, and drier. Who gave to chaff such power to freeze that it preserves snow
buried under it, and such power to warm that it ripens green fruit?</p>
<p>But who can explain the strange properties of fire itself, which blackens everything it
burns, though itself bright; and which, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost
all it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy cinders? Still this is not laid
down as an absolutely uniform law; for, on the contrary, stones baked in glowing fire
themselves also glow, and though the fire be rather of a red hue, and they white, yet white
is congruous with light, and black with darkness. Thus, though the fire burns the wood in
calcining the stones, these contrary effects do not result from the contrariety of the materials.
For though wood and stone differ, they are not contraries, like black and white, the one of
which colors is produced in the stones, while the other is produced in the wood by the same
action of fire, which imparts its own brightness to the former, while it begrimes the latter,
and which could have no effect on the one were it not fed by the other. Then what wonderful
properties do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light tap breaks it and a slight
pressure pulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to
decay. So enduring is it, that it is customary in laying down landmarks to put charcoal underneath
them, so that if, after the longest interval, any one raises an action, and pleads that
<note type="footnote">1499 Aristotle does not affirm it as a fact observed by himself, but as a popular tradition (Hist. anim. v. 19).
Pliny is equally cautious (Hist. nat. xxix. 23). Dioscorides declared the thing impossible (ii. 68).—Saisset.</note>

<pb n="1033"/>
there is no boundary stone, he may be convicted by the charcoal below. What then has enabled
it to last so long without rotting, though buried in the damp earth in which [its original]
wood rots, except this same fire which consumes all things?</p>
<p>Again, let us consider the wonders of lime; for besides growing white in fire, which
makes other things black, and of which I have already said enough, it has also a mysterious
property of conceiving fire within it. Itself cold to the touch, it yet has a hidden store of fire,
which is not at once apparent to our senses, but which experience teaches us, lies as it were
slumbering within it even while unseen. And it is for this reason called “quick lime,” as if
the fire were the invisible soul quickening the visible substance or body. But the marvellous
thing is, that this fire is kindled when it is extinguished. For to disengage the hidden fire
the lime is moistened or drenched with water, and then, though it be cold before, it becomes
hot by that very application which cools what is hot. As if the fire were departing from the
lime and breathing its last, it no longer lies hid, but appears; and then the lime lying in the
coldness of death cannot be requickened, and what we before called “quick,” we now call
“slaked.” What can be stranger than this? Yet there is a greater marvel still. For if you treat
the lime, not with water, but with oil, which is as fuel to fire, no amount of oil will heat it.
Now if this marvel had been told us of some Indian mineral which we had no opportunity
of experimenting upon, we should either have forthwith pronounced it a falsehood, or certainly
should have been greatly astonished. But things that daily present themselves to our
own observation we despise, not because they are really less marvellous, but because they
are common; so that even some products of India itself, remote as it is from ourselves, cease
to excite our admiration as soon as we can admire them at our leisure.1500</p>
<p>The diamond is a stone possessed by many among ourselves, especially by jewellers and
lapidaries, and the stone is so hard that it can be wrought neither by iron nor fire, nor, they
say, by anything at all except goat’s blood. But do you suppose it is as much admired by
those who own it and are familiar with its properties as by those to whom it is shown for
the first time? Persons who have not seen it perhaps do not believe what is said of it, or if
they do, they wonder as at a thing beyond their experience; and if they happen to see it, still
they marvel because they are unused to it, but gradually familiar experience [of it] dulls
their admiration. We know that the loadstone has a wonderful power of attracting iron.
When I first saw it I was thunderstruck, for I saw an iron ring attracted and suspended by
the stone; and then, as if it had communicated its own property to the iron it attracted, and
had made it a substance like itself, this ring was put near another, and lifted it up; and as
the first ring clung to the magnet, so did the second ring to the first. A third and a fourth
<note type="footnote">1500 So Lucretius, ii. 1025: “Sed neque tam facilis res ulla ’st, quin ea primum Difficilismagis ad credendum
constet: itemque Nil adeomagnum, nec tam mirabile quicquam Principis, quod non minuant mirarier omnes
Paulatim.”</note>

<pb n="1034"/>
were similarly added, so that there hung from the stone a kind of chain of rings, with their
hoops connected, not interlinking, but attached together by their outer surface. Who would
not be amazed at this virtue of the stone, subsisting as it does not only in itself, but transmitted
through so many suspended rings, and binding them together by invisible links? Yet
far more astonishing is what I heard about this stone from my brother in the episcopate,
Severus bishop of Milevis. He told me that Bathanarius, once count of Africa, when the
bishop was dining with him, produced a magnet, and held it under a silver plate on which
he placed a bit of iron; then as he moved his hand with the magnet underneath the plate,
the iron upon the plate moved about accordingly. The intervening silver was not affected
at all, but precisely as the magnet was moved backwards and forwards below it, no matter
how quickly, so was the iron attracted above. I have related what I myself have witnessed;
I have related what I was told by one whom I trust as I trust my own eyes. Let me further
say what I have read about this magnet. When a diamond is laid near it, it does not lift iron;
or if it has already lifted it, as soon as the diamond approaches, it drops it. These stones
come from India. But if we cease to admire them because they are now familiar, how much
less must they admire them who procure them very easily and send them to us? Perhaps
they are held as cheap as we hold lime, which, because it is common, we think nothing of,
though it has the strange property of burning when water, which is wont to quench fire, is
poured on it, and of remaining cool when mixed with oil, which ordinarily feeds fire.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—That There are Many Things Which Reason Cannot Account For, and
Which are Nevertheless True.</head>
<p>Nevertheless, when we declare the miracles which God has wrought, or will yet work,
and which we cannot bring under the very eyes of men, sceptics keep demanding that we
shall explain these marvels to reason. And because we cannot do so, inasmuch as they are
above human comprehension, they suppose we are speaking falsely. These persons themselves,
therefore, ought to account for all these marvels which we either can or do see. And
if they perceive that this is impossible for man to do, they should acknowledge that it cannot
be concluded that a thing has not been or shall not be because it cannot be reconciled to
reason, since there are things now in existence of which the same is true. I will not, then,
detail the multitude of marvels which are related in books, and which refer not to things
that happened once and passed away, but that are permanent in certain places, where, if
any one has the desire and opportunity, he may ascertain their truth; but a few only I recount.
The following are some of the marvels men tell us:—The salt of Agrigentum in Sicily, when
thrown into the fire, becomes fluid as if it were in water, but in the water it crackles as if it
were in the fire. The Garamantæ have a fountain so cold by day that no one can drink it,
so hot by night no one can touch it.1501 In Epirus, too, there is a fountain which, like all
others, quenches lighted torches, but, unlike all others, lights quenched torches. There is a
stone found in Arcadia, and called asbestos, because once lit it cannot be put out. The wood
of a certain kind of Egyptian fig-tree sinks in water, and does not float like other wood; and,
stranger still, when it has been sunk to the bottom for some time, it rises again to the surface,
though nature requires that when soaked in water it should be heavier than ever. Then
there are the apples of Sodom which grow indeed to an appearance of ripeness, but, when
you touch them with hand or tooth, the peal cracks, and they crumble into dust and ashes.
The Persian stone pyrites burns the hand when it is tightly held in it and so gets its name
from fire. In Persia too, there is found another stone called selenite, because its interior
brilliancy waxes and wanes with the moon. Then in Cappadocia the mares are impregnated
by the wind, and their foals live only three years. Tilon, an Indian island, has this advantage
over all other lands, that no tree which grows in it ever loses its foliage.</p>
<p>These and numberless other marvels recorded in the history, not of past events, but of
permanent localities, I have no time to enlarge upon and diverge from my main object; but
let those sceptics who refuse to credit the divine writings give me, if they can, a rational account
of them. For their only ground of unbelief in the Scriptures is, that they contain incredible
things, just such as I have been recounting. For, say they, reason cannot admit that
flesh burn and remain unconsumed, suffer without dying. Mighty reasoners, indeed, who
1501 Alluded to by Moore in his Melodies: “The fount that played In times of old through Ammon’s
shade, Though icy cold by day it ran, Yet still, like souls of mirth, began To burn when night was near.”

<pb n="1036"/>
are competent to give the reason of all the marvels that exist! Let them then give us the
reason of the few things we have cited, and which, if they did not know they existed, and
were only assured by us they would at some future time occur, they would believe still less
than that which they now refuse to credit on our word. For which of them would believe
us if, instead of saying that the living bodies of men hereafter will be such as to endure
everlasting pain and fire without ever dying, we were to say that in the world to come there
will be salt which becomes liquid in fire as if it were in water, and crackles in water as if it
were in fire; or that there will be a fountain whose water in the chill air of night is so hot
that it cannot be touched, while in the heat of day it is so cold that it cannot be drunk; or
that there will be a stone which by its own heat burns the hand when tightly held, or a stone
which cannot be extinguished if it has been lit in any part; or any of those wonders I have
cited, while omitting numberless others? If we were to say that these things would be found
in the world to come, and our sceptics were to reply, “If you wish us to believe these things,
satisfy our reason about each of them,” we should confess that we could not, because the
frail comprehension of man cannot master these and such-like wonders of God’s working;
and that yet our reason was thoroughly convinced that the Almighty does nothing without
reason, though the frail mind of man cannot explain the reason; and that while we are in
many instances uncertain what He intends, yet that it is always most certain that nothing
which He intends is impossible to Him; and that when He declares His mind, we believe
Him whom we cannot believe to be either powerless or false. Nevertheless these cavillers
at faith and exactors of reason, how do they dispose of those things of which a reason cannot
be given, and which yet exist, though in apparent contrariety to the nature of things? If we
had announced that these things were to be, these sceptics would have demanded from us
the reason of them, as they do in the case of those things which we are announcing as destined
to be. And consequently, as these present marvels are not non-existent, though human
reason and discourse are lost in such works of God, so those things we speak of are not impossible
because inexplicable; for in this particular they are in the same predicament as the
marvels of earth.</p>

<p>At this point they will perhaps reply, “These things have no existence; we don’t believe
one of them; they are travellers’ tales and fictitious romances;” and they may add what has
the appearance of argument, and say, “If you believe such things as these, believe what is
recorded in the same books, that there was or is a temple of Venus in which a candelabrum
set in the open air holds a lamp, which burns so strongly that no storm or rain extinguishes
it, and which is therefore called, like the stone mentioned above, the asbestos or inextinguishable
lamp.” They may say this with the intention of putting us into a dilemma: for if we
say this is incredible, then we shall impugn the truth of the other recorded marvels; if, on
the other hand, we admit that this is credible, we shall avouch the pagan deities. But, as I
have already said in the eighteenth book of this work, we do not hold it necessary to believe
all that profane history contains, since, as Varro says, even historians themselves disagree
on so many points, that one would think they intended and were at pains to do so; but we
believe, if we are disposed, those things which are not contradicted by these books, which
we do not hesitate to say we are bound to believe. But as to those permanent miracles of
nature, whereby we wish to persuade the sceptical of the miracles of the world to come,
those are quite sufficient for our purpose which we ourselves can observe or of which it is
not difficult to find trustworthy witnesses. Moreover, that temple of Venus, with its inextinguishable
lamp, so far from hemming us into a corner, opens an advantageous field to
our argument. For to this inextinguishable lamp we add a host of marvels wrought by men,
or by magic,—that is, by men under the influence of devils, or by the devils directly,—for
such marvels we cannot deny without impugning the truth of the sacred Scriptures we believe.
That lamp, therefore, was either by some mechanical and human device fitted with
asbestos, or it was arranged by magical art in order that the worshippers might be astonished,
or some devil under the name of Venus so signally manifested himself that this prodigy
both began and became permanent. Now devils are attracted to dwell in certain temples
by means of the creatures (God’s creatures, not theirs), who present to them what suits their
various tastes. They are attracted not by food like animals, but, like spirits, by such symbols
as suit their taste, various kinds of stones, woods, plants, animals, songs, rites. And that
men may provide these attractions, the devils first of all cunningly seduce them, either by
imbuing their hearts with a secret poison, or by revealing themselves under a friendly guise,
and thus make a few of them their disciples, who become the instructors of the multitude.
For unless they first instructed men, it were impossible to know what each of them desires,
what they shrink from, by what name they should be invoked or constrained to be present.
Hence the origin of magic and magicians. But, above all, they possess the hearts of men,
and are chiefly proud of this possession when they transform themselves into angels of light.
Very many things that occur, therefore, are their doing; and these deeds of theirs we ought

<pb n="1038"/>
all the more carefully to shun as we acknowledge them to be very surprising. And yet these
very deeds forward my present arguments. For if such marvels are wrought by unclean
devils, how much mightier are the holy angels! and what can not that God do who made
the angels themselves capable of working miracles!</p>
<p>If, then, very many effects can be contrived by human art, of so surprising a kind that
the uninitiated think them divine, as when, e.g., in a certain temple two magnets have been
adjusted, one in the roof, another in the floor, so that an iron image is suspended in midair
between them, one would suppose by the power of the divinity, were he ignorant of the
magnets above and beneath; or, as in the case of that lamp of Venus which we already
mentioned as being a skillful adaptation of asbestos; if, again, by the help of magicians,
whom Scripture calls sorcerers and enchanters, the devils could gain such power that the
noble poet Virgil should consider himself justified in describing a very powerful magician
in these lines:
<lg>
<l>“Her charms can cure what souls she please,</l>
<l>Rob other hearts of healthful ease,</l>
<l>Turn rivers backward to their source,</l>
<l>And make the stars forget their course,</l>
<l rend=" indent">And call up ghosts from night:</l>
<l>The ground shall bellow ’neath your feet:</l>
<l>The mountain-ash shall quit its seat,</l>
<l rend=" indent">And travel down the height;”1502—</l>
</lg>
if this be so, how much more able is God to do those things which to sceptics are incredible,
but to His power easy, since it is He who has given to stones and all other things their
virtue, and to men their skill to use them in wonderful ways; He who has given to the angels
a nature more mighty than that of all that lives on earth; He whose power surpasses all
marvels, and whose wisdom in working, ordaining, and permitting is no less marvellous in
its governance of all things than in its creation of all!</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—That the Ultimate Reason for Believing Miracles is the Omnipotence
of the Creator.</head>
<p>Why, then, cannot God effect both that the bodies of the dead shall rise, and that the
bodies of the damned shall be tormented in everlasting fire,—God, who made the world
full of countless miracles in sky, earth, air, and waters, while itself is a miracle unquestionably
greater and more admirable than all the marvels it is filled with? But those with whom or
against whom we are arguing, who believe both that there is a God who made the world,
and that there are gods created by Him who administer the world’s laws as His viceregents,—
our adversaries, I say, who, so far from denying emphatically, assert that there are
powers in the world which effect marvellous results (whether of their own accord, or because
they are invoked by some rite or prayer, or in some magical way), when we lay before them
the wonderful properties of other things which are neither rational animals nor rational
spirits, but such material objects as those we have just cited, are in the habit of replying,
This is their natural property, their nature; these are the powers naturally belonging to them.
Thus the whole reason why Agrigentine salt dissolves in fire and crackles in water is that
this is its nature. Yet this seems rather contrary to nature, which has given not to fire but
to water the power of melting salt, and the power of scorching it not to water but to fire.
But this they say, is the natural property of this salt, to show effects contrary to these. The
same reason, therefore, is assigned to account for that Garamantian fountain, of which one
and the same runlet is chill by day and boiling by night, so that in either extreme it cannot
be touched. So also of that other fountain which, though it is cold to the touch, and though
it, like other fountains, extinguishes a lighted torch, yet, unlike other fountains, and in a
surprising manner, kindles an extinguished torch. So of the asbestos stone, which, though
it has no heat of its own, yet when kindled by fire applied to it, cannot be extinguished. And
so of the rest, which I am weary of reciting, and in which, though there seems to be an extraordinary
property contrary to nature, yet no other reason is given for them than this,
that this is their nature,—a brief reason truly, and, I own, a satisfactory reply. But since God
is the author of all natures, how is it that our adversaries, when they refuse to believe what
we affirm, on the ground that it is impossible, are unwilling to accept from us a better explanation
than their own, viz., that this is the will of Almighty God,—for certainly He is
called Almighty only because He is mighty to do all He will,—He who was able to create so
many marvels, not only unknown, but very well ascertained, as I have been showing, and
which, were they not under our own observation, or reported by recent and credible witnesses,
would certainly be pronounced impossible? For as for those marvels which have no
other testimony than the writers in whose books we read them, and who wrote without being
divinely instructed, and are therefore liable to human error, we cannot justly blame any one
who declines to believe them.</p>

<pb n="1040"/>
<p>For my own part, I do not wish all the marvels I have cited to be rashly accepted, for I
do not myself believe them implicitly, save those which have either come under my own
observation, or which any one can readily verify, such as the lime which is heated by water
and cooled by oil; the magnet which by its mysterious and insensible suction attracts the
iron, but has no affect on a straw; the peacock’s flesh which triumphs over the corruption
from which not the flesh of Plato is exempt; the chaff so chilling that it prevents snow from
melting, so heating that it forces apples to ripen; the glowing fire, which, in accordance with
its glowing appearance, whitens the stones it bakes, while, contrary to its glowing appearance,
it begrimes most things it burns (just as dirty stains are made by oil, however pure it be, and
as the lines drawn by white silver are black); the charcoal, too, which by the action of fire is
so completely changed from its original, that a finely marked piece of wood becomes hideous,
the tough becomes brittle, the decaying incorruptible. Some of these things I know in
common with many other persons, some of them in common with all men; and there are
many others which I have not room to insert in this book. But of those which I have cited,
though I have not myself seen, but only read about them, I have been unable to find trustworthy
witnesses from whom I could ascertain whether they are facts, except in the case of
that fountain in which burning torches are extinguished and extinguished torches lit, and
of the apples of Sodom, which are ripe to appearance, but are filled with dust. And indeed
I have not met with any who said they had seen that fountain in Epirus, but with some who
knew there was a similar fountain in Gaul not far from Grenoble. The fruit of the trees of
Sodom, however, is not only spoken of in books worthy of credit, but so many persons say
that they have seen it that I cannot doubt the fact. But the rest of the prodigies I receive
without definitely affirming or denying them; and I have cited them because I read them in
the authors of our adversaries, and that I might prove how many things many among
themselves believe, because they are written in the works of their own literary men, though
no rational explanation of them is given, and yet they scorn to believe us when we assert
that Almighty God will do what is beyond their experience and observation; and this they
do even though we assign a reason for His work. For what better and stronger reason for
such things can be given than to say that the Almighty is able to bring them to pass, and
will bring them to pass, having predicted them in those books in which many other marvels
which have already come to pass were predicted? Those things which are regarded as impossible
will be accomplished according to the word, and by the power of that God who
predicted and effected that the incredulous nations should believe incredible wonders.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—That It is Not Contrary to Nature That, in an Object Whose Nature is
Known, There Should Be Discovered an Alteration of the Properties Which Have
Been Known as Its Natural Properties.</head>
<p>But if they reply that their reason for not believing us when we say that human bodies
will always burn and yet never die, is that the nature of human bodies is known to be quite
otherwise constituted; if they say that for this miracle we cannot give the reason which was
valid in the case of those natural miracles, viz., that this is the natural property, the nature
of the thing,—for we know that this is not the nature of human flesh,—we find our answer
in the sacred writings, that even this human flesh was constituted in one fashion before
there was sin,—was constituted, in fact, so that it could not die,—and in another fashion
after sin, being made such as we see it in this miserable state of mortality, unable to retain
enduring life. And so in the resurrection of the dead shall it be constituted differently from
its present well-known condition. But as they do not believe these writings of ours, in which
we read what nature man had in paradise, and how remote he was from the necessity of
death,—and indeed, if they did believe them, we should of course have little trouble in debating
with them the future punishment of the damned,—we must produce from the writings
of their own most learned authorities some instances to show that it is possible for a thing
to become different from what it was formerly known characteristically to be.</p>
<p>From the book of Marcus Varro, entitled, Of the Race of the Roman People, I cite word
for word the following instance: “There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for Castor
records that, in the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo by Plautus, and the lovely Hesperus
by Homer, there occurred so strange a prodigy, that it changed its color, size, form, course,
which never happened before nor since. Adrastus of Cyzicus, and Dion of Naples, famous
mathematicians, said that this occurred in the reign of Ogyges.” So great an author as Varro
would certainly not have called this a portent had it not seemed to be contrary to nature.
For we say that all portents are contrary to nature; but they are not so. For how is that
contrary to nature which happens by the will of God, since the will of so mighty a Creator
is certainly the nature of each created thing? A portent, therefore, happens not contrary to
nature, but contrary to what we know as nature. But who can number the multitude of
portents recorded in profane histories? Let us then at present fix our attention on this one
only which concerns the matter in hand. What is there so arranged by the Author of the
nature of heaven and earth as the exactly ordered course of the stars? What is there established
by laws so sure and inflexible? And yet, when it pleased Him who with sovereignty
and supreme power regulates all He has created, a star conspicuous among the rest by its
size and splendor changed its color, size, form, and, most wonderful of all, the order and
law of its course! Certainly that phenomenon disturbed the canons of the astronomers, if
there were any then, by which they tabulate, as by unerring computation, the past and future

<pb n="1042"/>
movements of the stars, so as to take upon them to affirm that this which happened to the
morning star (Venus) never happened before nor since. But we read in the divine books
that even the sun itself stood still when a holy man, Joshua the son of Nun, had begged this
from God until victory should finish the battle he had begun; and that it even went back,
that the promise of fifteen years added to the life of king Hezekiah might be sealed by this
additional prodigy. But these miracles, which were vouchsafed to the merits of holy men,
even when our adversaries believe them, they attribute to magical arts; so Virgil, in the lines
I quoted above, ascribes to magic the power to
<lg>
<l>“Turn rivers backward to their source,</l>
<l>And make the stars forget their course.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>For in our sacred books we read that this also happened, that a river “turned backward,”
was stayed above while the lower part flowed on, when the people passed over under the
above-mentioned leader, Joshua the son of Nun; and also when Elias the prophet crossed;
and afterwards, when his disciple Elisha passed through it: and we have just mentioned
how, in the case of king Hezekiah the greatest of the “stars forgot its course.” But what
happened to Venus, according to Varro, was not said by him to have happened in answer
to any man’s prayer.</p>
<p>Let not the sceptics then benight themselves in this knowledge of the nature of things,
as if divine power cannot bring to pass in an object anything else than what their own experience
has shown them to be in its nature. Even the very things which are most commonly
known as natural would not be less wonderful nor less effectual to excite surprise in all who
beheld them, if men were not accustomed to admire nothing but what is rare. For who that
thoughtfully observes the countless multitude of men, and their similarity of nature, can
fail to remark with surprise and admiration the individuality of each man’s appearance,
suggesting to us, as it does, that unless men were like one another, they would not be distinguished
from the rest of the animals; while unless, on the other hand, they were unlike, they
could not be distinguished from one another, so that those whom we declare to be like, we
also find to be unlike? And the unlikeness is the more wonderful consideration of the two;
for a common nature seems rather to require similarity. And yet, because the very rarity
of things is that which makes them wonderful, we are filled with much greater wonder when
we are introduced to two men so like, that we either always or frequently mistake in endeavoring
to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>But possibly, though Varro is a heathen historian, and a very learned one, they may
disbelieve that what I have cited from him truly occurred; or they may say the example is
invalid, because the star did not for any length of time continue to follow its new course,
but returned to its ordinary orbit. There is, then, another phenomenon at present open to
their observation, and which, in my opinion, ought to be sufficient to convince them that,

<pb n="1043"/>
though they have observed and ascertained some natural law, they ought not on that account
to prescribe to God, as if He could not change and turn it into something very different
from what they have observed. The land of Sodom was not always as it now is; but once it
had the appearance of other lands, and enjoyed equal if not richer fertility; for, in the divine
narrative, it was compared to the paradise of God. But after it was touched [by fire] from
heaven, as even pagan history testifies, and as is now witnessed by those who visit the spot,
it became unnaturally and horribly sooty in appearance; and its apples, under a deceitful
appearance of ripeness, contain ashes within. Here is a thing which was of one kind, and
is of another. You see how its nature was converted by the wonderful transmutation wrought
by the Creator of all natures into so very disgusting a diversity,—an alteration which after
so long a time took place, and after so long a time still continues. As therefore it was not
impossible to God to create such natures as He pleased, so it is not impossible to Him to
change these natures of His own creation into whatever He pleases, and thus spread abroad
a multitude of those marvels which are called monsters, portents, prodigies, phenomena,1503
and which if I were minded to cite and record, what end would there be to this work? They
say that they are called “monsters,” because they demonstrate or signify something;
“portents,” because they portend something; and so forth.1504 But let their diviners see how
they are either deceived, or even when they do predict true things, it is because they are inspired
by spirits, who are intent upon entangling the minds of men (worthy, indeed, of such
a fate) in the meshes of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and then upon some truth,
because they make so many predictions. Yet, for our part, these things which happen contrary
to nature, and are said to be contrary to nature (as the apostle, speaking after the manner
of men, says, that to graft the wild olive into the good olive, and to partake of its fatness, is
contrary to nature), and are called monsters, phenomena, portents, prodigies, ought to
demonstrate, portend, predict that God will bring to pass what He has foretold regarding
the bodies of men, no difficulty preventing Him, no law of nature prescribing to Him His
limit. How He has foretold what He is to do, I think I have sufficiently shown in the preceding
book, culling from the sacred Scriptures, both of the New and Old Testaments, not, indeed,
all the passages that relate to this, but as many as I judged to suffice for this work.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Of Hell, and the Nature of Eternal Punishments.</head>
<p>So then what God by His prophet has said of the everlasting punishment of the damned
shall come to pass—shall without fail come to pass,—“their worm shall not die, neither shall
their fire be quenched.”1505 In order to impress this upon us most forcibly, the Lord Jesus
Himself, when ordering us to cut off our members, meaning thereby those persons whom
a man loves as the most useful members of his body, says, “It is better for thee to enter into
life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched;
where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.” Similarly of the foot: “It is
better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.”
So, too, of the eye: “It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than
having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched.”1506 He did not shrink from using the same words three times over in one passage.
And who is not terrified by this repetition, and by the threat of that punishment uttered
so vehemently by the lips of the Lord Himself?</p>
<p>Now they who would refer both the fire and the worm to the spirit, and not to the body,
affirm that the wicked, who are separated from the kindgdom of God, shall be burned, as
it were, by the anguish of a spirit repenting too late and fruitlessly; and they contend that
fire is therefore not inappropriately used to express this burning torment, as when the apostle
exclaims “Who is offended, and I burn not?”1507 The worm, too, they think, is to be similarly
understood. For it is written they say, “As the moth consumes the garment, and the worm
the wood, so does grief consume the heart of a man.”1508 But they who make no doubt that
in that future punishment both body and soul shall suffer, affirm that the body shall be
burned with fire, while the soul shall be, as it were, gnawed by a worm of anguish. Though
this view is more reasonable,—for it is absurd to suppose that either body or soul will escape
pain in the future punishment,—yet, for my own part, I find it easier to understand both as
referring to the body than to suppose that neither does; and I think that Scripture is silent
regarding the spiritual pain of the damned, because, though not expressed, it is necessarily
understood that in a body thus tormented the soul also is tortured with a fruitless repentance.
For we read in the ancient Scriptures, “The vengeance of the flesh of the ungodly is fire and
worms.”1509 It might have been more briefly said, “The vengeance of the ungodly.” Why,
then, was it said, “The flesh of the ungodly,” unless because both the fire and the worm are

<pb n="1045"/>
to be the punishment of the flesh? Or if the object of the writer in saying, “The vengeance
of the flesh,” was to indicate that this shall be the punishment of those who live after the
flesh (for this leads to the second death, as the apostle intimated when he said, “For if ye
live after the flesh, ye shall die”1510, let each one make his own choice, either assigning the
fire to the body and the worm to the soul,—the one figuratively, the other really,—or assigning
both really to the body. For I have already sufficiently made out that animals can live
in the fire, in burning without being consumed, in pain without dying, by a miracle of the
most omnipotent Creator, to whom no one can deny that this is possible, if he be not ignorant
by whom has been made all that is wonderful in all nature. For it is God Himself who has
wrought all these miracles, great and small, in this world which I have mentioned, and incomparably
more which I have omitted, and who has enclosed these marvels in this world,
itself the greatest miracle of all. Let each man, then, choose which he will, whether he thinks
that the worm is real and pertains to the body, or that spiritual things are meant by bodily
representations, and that it belongs to the soul. But which of these is true will be more
readily discovered by the facts themselves, when there shall be in the saints such knowledge
as shall not require that their own experience teach them the nature of these punishments,
but as shall, by its own fullness and perfection, suffice to instruct them in this matter. For
“now we know in part, until that which is perfect is come;”1511 only, this we believe about
those future bodies, that they shall be such as shall certainly be pained by the fire.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Whether the Fire of Hell, If It Be Material Fire, Can Burn the Wicked
Spirits, that is to Say, Devils, Who are Immaterial.</head>
<p>Here arises the question: If the fire is not to be immaterial, analogous to the pain of the
soul, but material, burning by contact, so that bodies may be tormented in it, how can evil
spirits be punished in it? For it is undoubtedly the same fire which is to serve for the punishment
of men and of devils, according to the words of Christ: “Depart from me, ye cursed,
into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;”1512 unless, perhaps, as learned
men have thought, the devils have a kind of body made of that dense and humid air which
we feel strikes us when the wind is blowing. And if this kind of substance could not be affected
by fire, it could not burn when heated in the baths. For in order to burn, it is first
burned, and affects other things as itself is affected. But if any one maintains that the devils
have no bodies, this is not a matter either to be laboriously investigated, or to be debated
with keenness. For why may we not assert that even immaterial spirits may, in some extraordinary
way, yet really be pained by the punishment of material fire, if the spirits of
men, which also are certainly immaterial, are both now contained in material members of
the body, and in the world to come shall be indissolubly united to their own bodies?
Therefore, though the devils have no bodies, yet their spirits, that is, the devils themselves,
shall be brought into thorough contact with the material fires, to be tormented by them;
not that the fires themselves with which they are brought into contact shall be animated by
their connection with these spirits, and become animals composed of body and spirit, but,
as I said, this junction will be effected in a wonderful and ineffable way, so that they shall
receive pain from the fires, but give no life to them. And, in truth, this other mode of union,
by which bodies and spirits are bound together and become animals, is thoroughly marvellous,
and beyond the comprehension of man, though this it is which is man.</p>
<p>I would indeed say that these spirits will burn without any body of their own, as that
rich man was burning in hell when he exclaimed, “I am tormented in this flame,”1513 were
I not aware that it is aptly said in reply, that that flame was of the same nature as the eyes
he raised and fixed on Lazarus, as the tongue on which he entreated that a little cooling
water might be dropped, or as the finger of Lazarus, with which he asked that this might be
done,—all of which took place where souls exist without bodies. Thus, therefore, both that
flame in which he burned and that drop he begged were immaterial, and resembled the
visions of sleepers or persons in an ecstasy, to whom immaterial objects appear in a bodily
form. For the man himself who is in such a state, though it be in spirit only, not in body,
yet sees himself so like to his own body that he cannot discern any difference whatever. But
<note type="footnote">1512 Matt. xxv. 41.</note>
<note type="footnote">1513 Luke xvi. 24.</note>

<pb n="1047"/>
that hell, which also is called a lake of fire and brimstone,1514 will be material fire, and will
torment the bodies of the damned, whether men or devils,—the solid bodies of the one,
aerial bodies of the others; or if only men have bodies as well as souls, yet the evil spirits,
though without bodies, shall be so connected with the bodily fires as to receive pain without
imparting life. One fire certainly shall be the lot of both, for thus the truth has declared.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Whether It is Just that the Punishments of Sins Last Longer Than the
Sins Themselves Lasted.</head>
<p>Some, however, of those against whom we are defending the city of God, think it unjust
that any man be doomed to an eternal punishment for sins which, no matter how great they
were, were perpetrated in a brief space of time; as if any law ever regulated the duration of
the punishment by the duration of the offence punished! Cicero tells us that the laws recognize
eight kinds of penalty,—damages, imprisonment, scourging, reparation,1515 disgrace,
exile, death, slavery. Is there any one of these which may be compressed into a brevity
proportioned to the rapid commission of the offence, so that no longer time may be spent
in its punishment than in its perpetration, unless, perhaps, reparation? For this requires
that the offender suffer what he did, as that clause of the law says, “Eye for eye, tooth for
tooth.”1516 For certainly it is possible for an offender to lose his eye by the severity of legal
retaliation in as brief a time as he deprived another of his eye by the cruelty of his own lawlessness.
But if scourging be a reasonable penalty for kissing another man’s wife, is not the
fault of an instant visited with long hours of atonement, and the momentary delight punished
with lasting pain? What shall we say of imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only
for so long a time as he spent on the offence for which he is committed? or is not a penalty
of many years’ confinement imposed on the slave who has provoked his master with a word,
or has struck him a blow that is quickly over? And as to damages, disgrace, exile, slavery,
which are commonly inflicted so as to admit of no relaxation or pardon, do not these resemble
eternal punishments in so far as this short life allows a resemblance? For they are not
eternal only because the life in which they are endured is not eternal; and yet the crimes
which are punished with these most protracted sufferings are perpetrated in a very brief
space of time. Nor is there any one who would suppose that the pains of punishment should
occupy as short a time as the offense; or that murder, adultery, sacrilege, or any other crime,
should be measured, not by the enor mity of the injury or wickedness, but by the length of
time spent in its perpetration. Then as to the award of death for any great crime, do the
laws reckon the punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death is inflicted, or
in this, that the offender is eternally banished from the society of the living? And just as the
punishment of the first death cuts men off from this present mortal city, so does the punishment
of the second death cut men off from that future immortal city. For as the laws of this
present city do not provide for the executed criminal’s return to it, so neither is he who is
condemned to the second death recalled again to life everlasting. But if temporal sin is visited
with eternal punishment, how, then, they say, is that true which your Christ says, “With the

same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again?”1517 and they do not
observe that “the same measure” refers, not to an equal space of time, but to the retribution
of evil or, in other words, to the law by which he who has done evil suffers evil. Besides,
these words could be appropriately understood as referring to the matter of which our Lord
was speaking when He used them, viz., judgments and condemnation. Thus, if he who
unjustly judges and condemns is himself justly judged and condemned, he receives “with
the same measure” though not the same thing as he gave. For judgment he gave, and judgment
he receives, though the judgment he gave was unjust, the judgment he receives just.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Of the Greatness of the First Transgression, on Account of Which
Eternal Punishment is Due to All Who are Not Within the Pale of the Saviour’s
Grace.</head>
<p>But eternal punishment seems hard and unjust to human perceptions, because in the
weakness of our mortal condition there is wanting that highest and purest wisdom by which
it can be perceived how great a wickedness was committed in that first transgression. The
more enjoyment man found in God, the greater was his wickedness in abandoning Him;
and he who destroyed in himself a good which might have been eternal, became worthy of
eternal evil. Hence the whole mass of the human race is condemned; for he who at first
gave entrance to sin has been punished with all his posterity who were in him as in a root,
so that no one is exempt from this just and due punishment, unless delivered by mercy and
undeserved grace; and the human race is so apportioned that in some is displayed the efficacy
of merciful grace, in the rest the efficacy of just retribution. For both could not be displayed
in all; for if all had remained1518 under the punishment of just condemnation, there would
have been seen in no one the mercy of redeeming grace. And, on the other hand, if all had
been transferred from darkness to light, the severity of retribution would have been manifested
in none. But many more are left under punishment than are delivered from it, in
order that it may thus be shown what was due to all. And had it been inflicted on all, no
one could justly have found fault with the justice of Him who taketh vengeance; whereas,
in the deliverance of so many from that just award, there is cause to render the most cordial
thanks to the gratuitous bounty of Him who delivers.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Against the Opinion of Those Who Think that the Punishments of
the Wicked After Death are Purgatorial.</head>
<p>The Platonists, indeed, while they maintain that no sins are unpunished, suppose that
all punishment is administered for remedial purposes,1519 be it inflicted by human or divine
law, in this life or after death; for a man may be scathless here, or, though punished, may
yet not amend. Hence that passage of Virgil, where, when he had said of our earthly bodies
and mortal members, that our souls derive—
<lg>
<l>“Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,</l>
<l>And human laughter, human tears;</l>
<l>Immured in dungeon-seeming night,</l>
<l>They look abroad, yet see no light,”</l>
<l>goes on to say:</l>
<l>“Nay, when at last the life has fled,</l>
<l>And left the body cold and dead,</l>
<l>Ee’n then there passes not away</l>
<l>The painful heritage of clay;</l>
<l>Full many a long-contracted stain</l>
<l>Perforce must linger deep in grain.</l>
<l>So penal sufferings they endure</l>
<l>For ancient crime, to make them pure;</l>
<l>Some hang aloft in open view,</l>
<l>For winds to pierce them through and through,</l>
<l>While others purge their guilt deep-dyed</l>
<l>In burning fire or whelming tide.”1520</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>They who are of this opinion would have all punishments after death to be purgatorial;
and as the elements of air, fire, and water are superior to earth, one or other of these may
be the instrument of expiating and purging away the stain contracted by the contagion of
earth. So Virgil hints at the air in the words, “Some hang aloft for winds to pierce;” at the
water in “whelming tide;” and at fire in the expression “in burning fire.” For our part, we
recognize that even in this life some punishments are purgatorial,—not, indeed, to those
<note type="footnote">1519 Plato’s own theory was that punishment had a twofold purpose, to reform and to deter. “No one punishes
an offender on account of the past offense, and simply because he has done wrong, but for the sake of the future,
that the offense may not be again committed, either by the same person or by any one who has seen him punished.”—

whose life is none the better, but rather the worse for them, but to those who are constrained
by them to amend their life. All other punishments, whether temporal or eternal, inflicted
as they are on every one by divine providence, are sent either on account of past sins, or of
sins presently allowed in the life, or to exercise and reveal a man’s graces. They may be inflicted
by the instrumentality of bad men and angels as well as of the good. For even if any
one suffers some hurt through another’s wickedness or mistake, the man indeed sins whose
ignorance or injustice does the harm; but God, who by His just though hidden judgment
permits it to be done, sins not. But temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life
only, by others after death, by others both now and then; but all of them before that last and
strictest judgment. But of those who suffer temporary punishments after death, all are not
doomed to those everlasting pains which are to follow that judgment; for to some, as we
have already said, what is not remitted in this world is remitted in the next, that is, they are
not punished with the eternal punishment of the world to come.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Of the Temporary Punishments of This Life to Which the Human
Condition is Subject.</head>
<p>Quite exceptional are those who are not punished in this life, but only afterwards. Yet
that there have been some who have reached the decrepitude of age without experiencing
even the slightest sickness, and who have had uninterrupted enjoyment of life, I know both
from report and from my own observation. However, the very life we mortals lead is itself
all punishment, for it is all temptation, as the Scriptures declare, where it is written, “Is not
the life of man upon earth a temptation?”1521 For ignorance is itself no slight punishment,
or want of culture, which it is with justice thought so necessary to escape, that boys are
compelled, under pain of severe punishment, to learn trades or letters; and the learning to
which they are driven by punishment is itself so much of a punishment to them, that they
sometimes prefer the pain that drives them to the pain to which they are driven by it. And
who would not shrink from the alternative, and elect to die, if it were proposed to him either
to suffer death or to be again an infant? Our infancy, indeed, introducing us to this life not
with laughter but with tears, seems unconsciously to predict the ills we are to encounter.1522
Zoroaster alone is said to have laughed when he was born, and that unnatural omen portended
no good to him. For he is said to have been the inventor of magical arts, though indeed
they were unable to secure to him even the poor felicity of this present life against the assaults
of his enemies. For, himself king of the Bactrians, he was conquered by Ninus king of the
Assyrians. In short, the words of Scripture, “An heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from
the day that they go out of their mother’s womb till the day that they return to the mother
of all things,”1523—these words so infallibly find fulfillment, that even the little ones, who
by the layer of regeneration have been freed from the bond of original sin in which alone
they were held, yet suffer many ills, and in some instances are even exposed to the assaults
of evil spirits. But let us not for a moment suppose that this suffering is prejudicial to their
future happiness, even though it has so increased as to sever soul from body, and to terminate
their life in that early age.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—That Everything Which the Grace of God Does in the Way of Rescuing
Us from the Inveterate Evils in Which We are Sunk, Pertains to the Future World,
in Which All Things are Made New.</head>
<p>Nevertheless, in the “heavy yoke that is laid upon the sons of Adam, from the day that
they go out of their mother’s womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things,”
there is found an admirable though painful monitor teaching us to be sober-minded, and
convincing us that this life has become penal in consequence of that outrageous wickedness
which was perpetrated in Paradise, and that all to which the New Testament invites belongs
to that future inheritance which awaits us in the world to come, and is offered for our acceptance,
as the earnest that we may, in its own due time, obtain that of which it is the
pledge. Now, therefore, let us walk in hope, and let us by the spirit mortify the deeds of the
flesh, and so make progress from day to day. For “the Lord know eth them that are His;”1524
and “as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God,”1525 but by grace, not
by nature. For there is but one Son of God by nature, who in His compassion became Son
of man for our sakes, that we, by nature sons of men, might by grace become through Him
sons of God. For He, abiding unchangeable, took upon Him our nature, that thereby He
might take us to Himself; and, holding fast His own divinity, He became partaker of our
infirmity, that we, being changed into some better thing, might, by participating in His
righteousness and immortality, lose our own properties of sin and mortality, and preserve
whatever good quality He had implanted in our nature perfected now by sharing in the
goodness of His nature. For as by the sin of one man we have fallen into a misery so deplorable,
so by the righteousness of one Man, who also is God, shall we come to a blessedness
inconceivably exalted. Nor ought any one to trust that he has passed from the one man to
the other until he shall have reached that place where there is no temptation, and have
entered into the peace which he seeks in the many and various conflicts of this war, in which
“the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.”1526 Now, such a war as
this would have had no existence if human nature had, in the exercise of free will, continued
steadfast in the uprightness in which it was created. But now in its misery it makes war
upon itself, because in its blessedness it would not continue at peace with God; and this,
though it be a miserable calamity, is better than the earlier stages of this life, which do not
recognize that a war is to be maintained. For better is it to contend with vices than without
conflict to be subdued by them. Better, I say, is war with the hope of peace everlasting than
captivity without any thought of deliverance. We long, indeed, for the cessation of this war,
and, kindled by the flame of divine love, we burn for entrance on that well-ordered peace

in which whatever is inferior is for ever subordinated to what is above it. But if (which God
forbid) there had been no hope of so blessed a consummation, we should still have preferred
to endure the hardness of this conflict, rather than, by our non-resistance, to yield ourselves
to the dominion of vice.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—The Laws of Grace, Which Extend to All the Epochs of the Life of the
Regenerate.</head>
<p>But such is God’s mercy towards the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for glory,
that even the first age of man, that is, infancy, which submits without any resistance to the
flesh, and the second age, which is called boyhood, and which has not yet understanding
enough to undertake this warfare, and therefore yields to almost every vicious pleasure
(because though this age has the power of speech,1527 and may therefore seem to have passed
infancy, the mind is still too weak to comprehend the commandment), yet if either of these
ages has received the sacraments of the Mediator, then, although the present life be immediately
brought to an end, the child, having been translated from the power of darkness to
the kingdom of Christ, shall not only be saved from eternal punishments, but shall not even
suffer purgatorial torments after death. For spiritual regeneration of itself suffices to prevent
any evil consequences resulting after death from the connection with death which carnal
generation forms.1528 But when we reach that age which can now comprehend the commandment,
and submit to the dominion of law, we must declare war upon vices, and wage
this war keenly, lest we be landed in damnable sins. And if vices have not gathered strength,
by habitual victory they are more easily overcome and subdued; but if they have been used
to conquer and rule, it is only with difficulty and labor they are mastered. And indeed this
victory cannot be sincerely and truly gained but by delighting in true righteousness, and it
is faith in Christ that gives this. For if the law be present with its command, and the Spirit
be absent with His help, the presence of the prohibition serves only to increase the desire
to sin, and adds the guilt of transgression. Sometimes, indeed, patent vices are overcome
by other and hidden vices, which are reckoned virtues, though pride and a kind of ruinous
self-sufficiency are their informing principles. Accordingly vices are then only to be considered
overcome when they are conquered by the love of God, which God Himself alone
gives, and which He gives only through the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus, who became a partaker of our mortality that He might make us partakers of His divinity.
But few indeed are they who are so happy as to have passed their youth without
committing any damnable sins, either by dissolute or violent conduct, or by following some
godless and unlawful opinions, but have subdued by their greatness of soul everything in
them which could make them the slaves of carnal pleasures. The greater number having
first become transgressors of the law that they have received, and having allowed vice to
have the ascendency in them, then flee to grace for help, and so, by a penitence more bitter,
and a struggle more violent than it would otherwise have been, they subdue the soul to God,
and thus give it its lawful authority over the flesh, and become victors. Whoever, therefore,

desires to escape eternal punishment, let him not only be baptized, but also justified in

there are any purgatorial pains except before that final and dreadful judgment. We must
not, however deny that even the eternal fire will be proportioned to the deserts of the wicked,
so that to some it will be more, and to others less painful, whether this result be accomplished
by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself, graduated according to every one’s merit,
or whether it be that the heat remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity

<head>Chapter 17.—Of Those Who Fancy that No Men Shall Be Punished Eternally.</head>
<p>I must now, I see, enter the lists of amicable controversy with those tender-hearted
Christians who decline to believe that any, or that all of those whom the infallibly just Judge
may pronounce worthy of the punishment of hell, shall suffer eternally, and who suppose
that they shall be delivered after a fixed term of punishment, longer or shorter according to
the amount of each man’s sin. In respect of this matter, Origen was even more indulgent;
for he believed that even the devil himself and his angels, after suffering those more severe
and prolonged pains which their sins deserved, should be delivered from their torments,
and associated with the holy angels. But the Church, not without reason, condemned him
for this and other errors, especially for his theory of the ceaseless alternation of happiness
and misery, and the interminable transitions from the one state to the other at fixed periods
of ages; for in this theory he lost even the credit of being merciful, by allotting to the saints
real miseries for the expiation of their sins, and false happiness, which brought them no
true and secure joy, that is, no fearless assurance of eternal blessedness. Very different,
however, is the error we speak of, which is dictated by the tenderness of these Christians
who suppose that the sufferings of those who are condemned in the judgment will be temporary,
while the blessedness of all who are sooner or later set free will be eternal. Which
opinion, if it is good and true because it is merciful, will be so much the better and truer in
proportion as it becomes more merciful. Let, then, this fountain of mercy be extended, and
flow forth even to the lost angels, and let them also be set free, at least after as many and
long ages as seem fit! Why does this stream of mercy flow to all the human race, and dry
up as soon as it reaches the angelic? And yet they dare not extend their pity further, and
propose the deliverance of the devil himself. Or if any one is bold enough to do so, he does
indeed put to shame their charity, but is himself convicted of error that is more unsightly,
and a wresting of God’s truth that is more perverse, in proportion as his clemency of sentiment
seems to be greater.1529</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—Of Those Who Fancy That, on Account of the Saints’ Intercession,
Man Shall Be Damned in the Last Judgment.</head>
<p>There are others, again, with whose opinions I have become acquainted in conversation,
who, though they seem to reverence the holy Scriptures, are yet of reprehensible life, and
who accordingly, in their own interest, attribute to God a still greater compassion towards
men. For they acknowledge that it is truly predicted in the divine word that the wicked and
unbelieving are worthy of punishment, but they assert that, when the judgment comes,
mercy will prevail. For, say they, God, having compassion on them, will give them up to
the prayers and intercessions of His saints. For if the saints used to pray for them when
they suffered from their cruel hatred, how much more will they do so when they see them
prostrate and humble suppliants? For we cannot, they say, believe that the saints shall lose
their bowels of compassion when they have attained the most perfect and complete holiness;
so that they who, when still sinners, prayed for their enemies, should now, when they are
freed from sin, withhold from interceding for their suppliants. Or shall God refuse to listen
to so many of His beloved children, when their holiness has purged their prayers of all
hindrance to His answering them? And the passage of the psalm which is cited by those
who admit that wicked men and infidels shall be punished for a long time, though in the
end delivered from all sufferings, is claimed also by the persons we are now speaking of as
making much more for them. The verse runs: “Shall God forget to be gracious? Shall He
in anger shut up His tender mercies?”1530 His anger, they say, would condemn all that are
unworthy of everlasting happiness to endless punishment. But if He suffer them to be
punished for a long time, or even at all, must He not shut up His tender mercies, which the
Psalmist implies He will not do? For he does not say, Shall He in anger shut up His tender
mercies for a long period? but he implies that He will not shut them up at all.</p>
<p>And they deny that thus God’s threat of judgment is proved to be false even though He
condemn no man, any more than we can say that His threat to overthrow Nineveh was false,
though the destruction which was absolutely predicted was not accomplished. For He did
not say, “Nineveh shall be overthrown if they do not repent and amend their ways,” but
without any such condition He foretold that the city should be overthrown. And this prediction,
they maintain, was true because God predicted the punishment which they deserved,
although He was not to inflict it. For though He spared them on their repentance yet He
was certainly aware that they would repent, and, notwithstanding, absolutely and definitely
predicted that the city should be overthrown. This was true, they say, in the truth of severity,
because they were worthy of it; but in respect of the compassion which checked His anger,
so that He spared the suppliants from the punishment with which He had threatened the
rebellious, it was not true. If, then, He spared those whom His own holy prophet was pro-
<note type="footnote">1530 Ps. lxxvii. 9.</note>

<pb n="1060"/>
voked at His sparing, how much more shall He spare those more wretched suppliants for
whom all His saints shall intercede? And they suppose that this conjecture of theirs is not
hinted at in Scripture, for the sake of stimulating many to reformation of life through fear
of very protracted or eternal sufferings, and of stimulating others to pray for those who have
not reformed. However, they think that the divine oracles are not altogether silent on this
point; for they ask to what purpose is it said, “How great is Thy goodness which Thou hast
hidden for them that fear Thee,”1531 if it be not to teach us that the great and hidden
sweetness of God’s mercy is concealed in order that men may fear? To the same purpose
they think the apostle said, “For God hath concluded all men in unbelief, that He may have
mercy upon all,”1532 signifying that no one should be condemned by God. And yet they
who hold this opinion do not extend it to the acquittal or liberation of the devil and his angels.
Their human tenderness is moved only towards men, and they plead chiefly their own
cause, holding out false hopes of impunity to their own depraved lives by means of this
quasi compassion of God to the whole race. Consequently they who promise this impunity
even to the prince of the devils and his satellites make a still fuller exhibition of the mercy
of God.</p>

to the end shall be saved,”1535 and who promise salvation only to those who continue in
the Church catholic; and though such persons have lived badly, yet, say they, they shall be
saved as by fire through virtue of the foundation of which the apostle says, “For other
foundation hath no man laid than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus. Now if any man
build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man’s
work shall be made manifest: for the day of the Lord shall declare it, for it shall be revealed
by fire; and each man’s work shall be proved of what sort it is. If any man’s work shall endure
which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. But if any man’s work shall be
burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.”1536 They
say, accordingly, that the catholic Christian, no matter what his life be, has Christ as his
foundation, while this foundation is not possessed by any heresy which is separated from
the unity of His body. And therefore, through virtue of this foundation, even though the
catholic Christian by the inconsistency of his life has been as one building up wood, hay,
stubble, upon it, they believe that he shall be saved by fire, in other words, that he shall be
delivered after tasting the pain of that fire to which the wicked shall be condemned at the

<head>Chapter 22.—Of Those Who Fancy that the Sins Which are Intermingled with Alms-

<p>I have also met with some who are of opinion that such only as neglect to cover their
sins with alms-deeds shall be punished in everlasting fire; and they cite the words of the
Apostle James, “He shall have judgment without mercy who hath shown no mercy.”1537
Therefore, say they, he who has not amended his ways, but yet has intermingled his profligate
and wicked actions with works of mercy, shall receive mercy in the judgment, so that he
shall either quite escape condemnation, or shall be liberated from his doom after some time
shorter or longer. They suppose that this was the reason why the Judge Himself of quick
and dead declined to mention anything else than works of mercy done or omitted, when
awarding to those on His right hand life eternal, and to those on His left everlasting punishment.
1538 To the same purpose, they say, is the daily petition we make in the Lord’s prayer,
“Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”1539 For, no doubt, whoever pardons the
person who has wronged him does a charitable action. And this has been so highly commended
by the Lord Himself, that He says, “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
your Father forgive your trespasses.”1540 And so it is to this kind of alms-deeds that the
saying of the Apostle James refers, “He shall have judgment without mercy that hath shown
no mercy.” And our Lord, they say, made no distinction of great and small sins, but “Your
Father will forgive your sins, if ye forgive men theirs.” Consequently they conclude that,
though a man has led an abandoned life up to the last day of it, yet whatsoever his sins have
been, they are all remitted by virtue of this daily prayer, if only he has been mindful to attend
to this one thing, that when they who have done him any injury ask his pardon, he forgive
them from his heart.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Against Those Who are of Opinion that the Punishment Neither of
the Devil Nor of Wicked Men Shall Be Eternal.</head>
<p>First of all, it behoves us to inquire and to recognize why the Church has not been able
to tolerate the idea that promises cleansing or indulgence to the devil even after the most
severe and protracted punishment. For so many holy men, imbued with the spirit of the
Old and New Testament, did not grudge to angels of any rank or character that they should
enjoy the blessedness of the heavenly kingdom after being cleansed by suffering, but rather
they perceived that they could not invalidate nor evacuate the divine sentence which the
Lord predicted that He would pronounce in the judgment, saying, “Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”1541 For here it is evident
that the devil and his angels shall burn in everlasting fire. And there is also that declaration
in the Apocalypse, “The devil their deceiver was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
where also are the beast and the false prophet. And they shall be tormented day and night
for ever.”1542 In the former passage “everlasting” is used, in the latter “for ever;” and by
these words Scripture is wont to mean nothing else than endless duration. And therefore
no other reason, no reason more obvious and just, can be found for holding it as the fixed
and immovable belief of the truest piety, that the devil and his angels shall never return to
the justice and life of the saints, than that Scripture, which deceives no man, says that God
spared them not, and that they were condemned beforehand by Him, and cast into prisons
of darkness in hell,1543 being reserved to the judgment of the last day, when eternal fire shall
receive them, in which they shall be tormented world without end. And if this be so, how
can it be believed that all men, or even some, shall be withdrawn from the endurance of
punishment after some time has been spent in it? how can this be believed without enervating
our faith in the eternal punishment of the devils? For if all or some of those to whom it shall
be said, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels,”1544 are not to be always in that fire, then what reason is there for believing that the
devil and his angels shall always be there? Or is perhaps the sentence of God, which is to
be pronounced on wicked men and angels alike, to be true in the case of the angels, false in
that of men? Plainly it will be so if the conjectures of men are to weigh more than the word
of God. But because this is absurd, they who desire to be rid of eternal punishment ought
to abstain from arguing against God, and rather, while yet there is opportunity, obey the
divine commands. Then what a fond fancy is it to suppose that eternal punishment means
long continued punishment, while eternal life means life without end, since Christ in the
<note type="footnote">1541 Matt. xxv. 41.</note>
<note type="footnote">1542 Rev. xx. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">1543 2 Pet. ii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1544 Matt. xxv. 41.</note>

<pb n="1066"/>
very same passage spoke of both in similar terms in one and the same sentence, “These shall
go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into life eternal!”1545 If both destinies
are “eternal,” then we must either understand both as long-continued but at last terminating,
or both as endless. For they are correlative,—on the one hand, punishment eternal, on the
other hand, life eternal. And to say in one and the same sense, life eternal shall be endless,
punishment eternal shall come to an end, is the height of absurdity. Wherefore, as the
eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal punishment of those who are
doomed to it shall have no end.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Against Those Who Fancy that in the Judgment of God All the Accused
Will Be Spared in Virtue of the Prayers of the Saints.</head>
<p>And this reasoning is equally conclusive against those who, in their own interest, but
under the guise of a greater tenderness of spirit, attempt to invalidate the words of God, and
who assert that these words are true, not because men shall suffer those things which are
threatened by God, but because they deserve to suffer them. For God, they say, will yield
them to the prayers of His saints, who will then the more earnestly pray for their enemies,
as they shall be more perfect in holiness, and whose prayers will be the more efficacious and
the more worthy of God’s ear, because now purged from all sin whatsoever. Why, then, if
in that perfected holiness their prayers be so pure and all-availing, will they not use them
in behalf of the angels for whom eternal fire is prepared, that God may mitigate His sentence
and alter it, and extricate them from that fire? Or will there, perhaps, be some one hardy
enough to affirm that even the holy angels will make common cause with holy men (then
become the equals of God’s angels), and will intercede for the guilty, both men and angels,
that mercy may spare them the punishment which truth has pronounced them to deserve?
But this has been asserted by no one sound in the faith; nor will be. Otherwise there is no
reason why the Church should not even now pray for the devil and his angels, since God
her Master has ordered her to pray for her enemies. The reason, then, which prevents the
Church from now praying for the wicked angels, whom she knows to be her enemies, is the
identical reason which shall prevent her, however perfected in holiness, from praying at the
last judgment for those men who are to be punished in eternal fire. At present she prays
for her enemies among men, because they have yet opportunity for fruitful repentance. For
what does she especially beg for them but that “God would grant them repentance,” as the
apostle says, “that they may return to soberness out of the snare of the devil, by whom they
are held captive according to his will?”1546 But if the Church were certified who those are,
who, though they are still abiding in this life, are yet predestinated to go with the devil into
eternal fire, then for them she could no more pray than for him. But since she has this certainty
regarding no man, she prays for all her enemies who yet live in this world; and yet
she is not heard in behalf of all. But she is heard in the case of those only who, though they
oppose the Church, are yet predestinated to become her sons through her intercession. But
if any retain an impenitent heart until death, and are not converted from enemies into sons,
does the Church continue to pray for them, for the spirits, i.e., of such persons deceased?
And why does she cease to pray for them, unless because the man who was not translated
into Christ’s kingdom while he was in the body, is now judged to be of Satan’s following?</p>
<p>It is then, I say, the same reason which prevents the Church at any time from praying
for the wicked angels, which prevents her from praying hereafter for those men who are to
<note type="footnote">1546 2 Tim. ii. 25, 26.</note>

<pb n="1068"/>
be punished in eternal fire; and this also is the reason why, though she prays even for the
wicked so long as they live, she yet does not even in this world pray for the unbelieving and
godless who are dead. For some of the dead, indeed, the prayer of the Church or of pious
individuals is heard; but it is for those who, having been regenerated in Christ, did not spend
their life so wickedly that they can be judged unworthy of such compassion, nor so well that
they can be considered to have no need of it.1547 As also, after the resurrection, there will
be some of the dead to whom, after they have endured the pains proper to the spirits of the
dead, mercy shall be accorded, and acquittal from the punishment of the eternal fire. For
were there not some whose sins, though not remitted in this life, shall be remitted in that
which is to come, it could not be truly said, “They shall not be forgiven, neither in this world,
neither in that which is to come.”1548 But when the Judge of quick and dead has said, “Come,
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world,” and to those on the other side, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire,
which is prepared for the devil and his angels,” and “These shall go away into eternal punishment,
but the righteous into eternal life,”1549 it were excessively presumptuous to say
that the punishment of any of those whom God has said shall go away into eternal punishment
shall not be eternal, and so bring either despair or doubt upon the corresponding
promise of life eternal.</p>
<p>Let no man then so understand the words of the Psalmist, “Shall God forget to be gracious?
shall He shut up in His anger His tender mercies”1550 as if the sentence of God were
true of good men, false of bad men, or true of good men and wicked angels, but false of bad
men. For the Psalmist’s words refer to the vessels of mercy and the children of the promise,
of whom the prophet himself was one; for when he had said, “Shall God forget to be gracious?
shall He shut up in His anger His tender mercies?” and then immediately subjoins, “And I
said, Now I begin: this is the change wrought by the right hand of the Most High,”1551 he
manifestly explained what he meant by the words, “Shall he shut up in His anger His tender
mercies?” For God’s anger is this mortal life, in which man is made like to vanity, and his
days pass as a shadow.1552 Yet in this anger God does not forget to be gracious, causing
His sun to shine and His rain to descend on the just and the unjust;1553 and thus He does

not in His anger cut short His tender mercies, and especially in what the Psalmist speaks of
in the words, “Now I begin: this change is from the right hand of the Most High;” for He
changes for the better the vessels of mercy, even while they are still in this most wretched
life, which is God’s anger, and even while His anger is manifesting itself in this miserable
corruption; for “in His anger He does not shut up His tender mercies.” And since the truth
of this divine canticle is quite satisfied by this application of it, there is no need to give it a
reference to that place in which those who do not belong to the city of God are punished in
eternal fire. But if any persist in extending its application to the torments of the wicked, let
them at least understand it so that the anger of God, which has threatened the wicked with
eternal punishment, shall abide, but shall be mixed with mercy to the extent of alleviating
the torments which might justly be inflicted; so that the wicked shall neither wholly escape,
nor only for a time endure these threatened pains, but that they shall be less severe and more
endurable than they deserve. Thus the anger of God shall continue, and at the same time
He will not in this anger shut up His tender mercies. But even this hypothesis I am not to
be supposed to affirm because I do not positively oppose it.1554</p>
<p>As for those who find an empty threat rather than a truth in such passages as these:
“Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire;” and “These shall go away into eternal
punishment;”1555 and “They shall be tormented for ever and ever;”1556 and “Their worm
shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched,”1557—such persons, I say, are most emphatically
and abundantly refuted, not by me so much as by the divine Scripture itself. For
the men of Nineveh repented in this life, and therefore their repentance was fruitful, inasmuch
as they sowed in that field which the Lord meant to be sown in tears that it might afterwards
be reaped in joy. And yet who will deny that God’s prediction was fulfilled in their case, if
at least he observes that God destroys sinners not only in anger but also in compassion?
For sinners are destroyed in two ways,—either, like the Sodomites, the men themselves are
punished for their sins, or, like the Ninevites, the men’s sins are destroyed by repentance.
God’s prediction, therefore, was fulfilled,—the wicked Nineveh was overthrown, and a good
Nineveh built up. For its walls and houses remained standing; the city was overthrown in
its depraved manners. And thus, though the prophet was provoked that the destruction
which the inhabitants dreaded, because of his prediction, did not take place, yet that which
God’s foreknowledge had predicted did take place, for He who foretold the destruction
knew how it should be fulfilled in a less calamitous sense.</p>

<p>But that these perversely compassionate persons may see what is the purport of these
words, “How great is the abundance of Thy sweetness, Lord, which Thou hast hidden for
them that fear Thee,”1558 let them read what follows: “And Thou hast perfected it for them
that hope in Thee.” For what means, “Thou hast hidden it for them that fear Thee,” “Thou
hast perfected it for them that hope in Thee,” unless this, that to those who through fear of
punishment seek to establish their own righteousness by the law, the righteousness of God
is not sweet, because they are ignorant of it? They have not tasted it. For they hope in
themselves, not in Him; and therefore God’s abundant sweetness is hidden from them.
They fear God, indeed, but it is with that servile fear “which is not in love; for perfect love
casteth out fear.”1559 Therefore to them that hope in Him He perfecteth His sweetness, inspiring
them with His own love, so that with a holy fear, which love does not cast out, but
which endureth for ever, they may, when they glory, glory in the Lord. For the righteousness
of God is Christ, “who is of God made unto us,” as the apostle says, “wisdom, and righteousness,
and sanctification, and redemption: as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in
the Lord.”1560 This righteousness of God, which is the gift of grace without merits, is not
known by those who go about to establish their own righteousness, and are therefore not
subject to the righteousness of God, which is Christ.1561 But it is in this righteousness that
we find the great abundance of God’s sweetness, of which the psalm says, “Taste and see
how sweet the Lord is.”1562 And this we rather taste than partake of to satiety in this our
pilgrimage. We hunger and thirst for it now, that hereafter we may be satisfied with it when
we see Him as He is, and that is fulfilled which is written, “I shall be satisfied when Thy
glory shall be manifested.”1563 It is thus that Christ perfects the great abundance of His
sweetness to them that hope in Him. But if God conceals His sweetness from them that
fear Him in the sense that these our objectors fancy, so that men’s ignorance of His purpose
of mercy towards the wicked may lead them to fear Him and live better, and so that there
may be prayer made for those who are not living as they ought, how then does He perfect
His sweetness to them that hope in Him, since, if their dreams be true, it is this very sweetness
which will prevent Him from punishing those who do not hope in Him? Let us then seek
that sweetness of His, which He perfects to them that hope in Him, not that which He is
supposed to perfect to those who despise and blaspheme Him; for in vain, after this life,
does a man seek for what he has neglected to provide while in this life.</p>

<p>Then, as to that saying of the apostle, “For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that He
may have mercy upon all,”1564 it does not mean that He will condemn no one; but the
foregoing context shows what is meant. The apostle composed the epistle for the Gentiles
who were already believers; and when he was speaking to them of the Jews who were yet to
believe, he says, “For as ye in times past believed not God, yet have now obtained mercy
through their unbelief; even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy
they also may obtain mercy.” Then he added the words in question with which these persons
beguile themselves: “For God concluded all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon
all.” All whom, if not all those of whom he was speaking, just as if he had said, “Both you
and them?” God then concluded all those in unbelief, both Jews and Gentiles, whom He
foreknew and predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, in order that they
might be confounded by the bitterness of unbelief, and might repent and believingly turn
to the sweetness of God’s mercy, and might take up that exclamation of the psalm, “How
great is the abundance of Thy sweetness, O Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them that
fear Thee, but hast perfected to them that hope,” not in themselves, but “in Thee.” He has
mercy, then, on all the vessels of mercy. And what means “all?” Both those of the Gentiles
and those of the Jews whom He predestinated, called, justified, glorified: none of these will
be condemned by Him; but we cannot say none of all men whatever.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Whether Those Who Received Heretical Baptism, and Have Afterwards
Fallen Away to Wickedness of Life; Or Those Who Have Received Catholic
Baptism, But Have Afterwards Passed Over to Heresy and Schism; Or Those
Who Have Remained in the Catholic Church in Which They Were Baptized,
But Have Continued to Live Immorally,—May Hope Through the Virtue of the
Sacraments for the Remission of Eternal Punishment.</head>
<p>But let us now reply to those who promise deliverance from eternal fire, not to the
devil and his angels (as neither do they of whom we have been speaking), nor even to all
men whatever, but only to those who have been washed by the baptism of Christ, and have
become partakers of His body and blood, no matter how they have lived, no matter what
heresy or impiety they have fallen into. But they are contradicted by the apostle, where he
says, “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variances, emulations, wrath, strife, heresies,
envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and the like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also
told you in time past, for they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
God.”1565 Certainly this sentence of the apostle is false, if such persons shall be delivered
after any lapse of time, and shall then inherit the kingdom of God. But as it is not false, they
shall certainly never inherit the kingdom of God. And if they shall never enter that kingdom,
then they shall always be retained in eternal punishment; for there is no middle place where
he may live unpunished who has not been admitted into that kingdom.</p>
<p>And therefore we may reasonably inquire how we are to understand these words of the
Lord Jesus: “This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this
bread, he shall live for ever.”1566 And those, indeed, whom we are now answering, are refuted
in their interpretation of this passage by those whom we are shortly to answer, and who do
not promise this deliverance to all who have received the sacraments of baptism and the
Lord’s body, but only to the catholics, however wickedly they live; for these, say they, have
eaten the Lord’s body not only sacramentally, but really, being constituted members of His
body, of which the apostle says, “We being many are one bread, one body.”1567 He then
who is in the unity of Christ’s body (that is to say, in the Christian membership), of which
body the faithful have been wont to receive the sacrament at the altar, that man is truly said
to eat the body and drink the blood of Christ. And consequently heretics and schismatics
being separate from the unity of this body, are able to receive the same sacrament, but with
<note type="footnote">1565 Gal. v. 19–21.</note>
<note type="footnote">1566 John vi. 50, 51.</note>
<note type="footnote">1567 1 Cor. x. 17.</note>

<pb n="1073"/>
no profit to themselves,—nay, rather to their own hurt, so that they are rather more severely
judged than liberated after some time. For they are not in that bond of peace which is
symbolized by that sacrament.</p>
<p>But again, even those who sufficiently understand that he who is not in the body of
Christ cannot be said to eat the body of Christ, are in error when they promise liberation
from the fire of eternal punishment to persons who fall away from the unity of that body
into heresy, or even into heathenish superstition. For, in the first place, they ought to consider
how intolerable it is, and how discordant with sound doctrine, to suppose that many, indeed,
or almost all, who have forsaken the Church catholic, and have originated impious heresies
and become heresiarchs, should enjoy a destiny superior to those who never were catholics,
but have fallen into the snares of these others; that is to say, if the fact of their catholic baptism
and original reception of the sacrament of the body of Christ in the true body of Christ is
sufficient to deliver these heresiarchs from eternal punishment. For certainly he who deserts
the faith, and from a deserter becomes an assailant, is worse than he who has not deserted
the faith he never held. And, in the second place, they are contradicted by the apostle, who,
after enumerating the works of the flesh, says with reference to heresies, “They who do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>And therefore neither ought such persons as lead an abandoned and damnable life to
be confident of salvation, though they persevere to the end in the communion of the Church
catholic, and comfort themselves with the words, “He that endureth to the end shall be
saved.” By the iniquity of their life they abandon that very righteousness of life which Christ
is to them, whether it be by fornication, or by perpetrating in their body the other uncleannesses
which the apostle would not so much as mention, or by a dissolute luxury, or by doing
any one of those things of which he says, “They who do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God.” Consequently, they who do such things shall not exist anywhere but in
eternal punishment, since they cannot be in the kingdom of God. For, while they continue
in such things to the very end of life, they cannot be said to abide in Christ to the end; for
to abide in Him is to abide in the faith of Christ. And this faith, according to the apostle’s
definition of it, “worketh by love.”1568 And “love,” as he elsewhere says, “worketh no
evil.”1569 Neither can these persons be said to eat the body of Christ, for they cannot even
be reckoned among His members. For, not to mention other reasons, they cannot be at
once the members of Christ and the members of a harlot. In fine, He Himself, when He
says, “He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,”1570
shows what it is in reality, and not sacramentally, to eat His body and drink His blood; for

this is to dwell in Christ, that He also may dwell in us. So that it is as if He said, He that
dwelleth not in me, and in whom I do not dwell, let him not say or think that he eateth my
body or drinketh my blood. Accordingly, they who are not Christ’s members do not dwell
in Him. And they who make themselves members of a harlot, are not members of Christ
unless they have penitently abandoned that evil, and have returned to this good to be reconciled
to it.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—What It is to Have Christ for a Foundation, and Who They are to
Whom Salvation as by Fire is Promised.</head>
<p>But, say they, the catholic Christians have Christ for a foundation, and they have not
fallen away from union with Him, no matter how depraved a life they have built on this
foundation, as wood, hay, stubble; and accordingly the well-directed faith by which Christ
is their foundation will suffice to deliver them some time from the continuance of that fire,
though it be with loss, since those things they have built on it shall be burned. Let the Apostle
James summarily reply to them: “If any man say he has faith, and have not works, can faith
save him?”1571 And who then is it, they ask, of whom the Apostle Paul says, “But he himself
shall be saved, yet so as by fire?”1572 Let us join them in their inquiry; and one thing is very
certain, that it is not he of whom James speaks, else we should make the two apostles contradict
one another, if the one says, “Though a man’s works be evil, his faith will save him
as by fire,” while the other says, “If he have not good works, can his faith save him?”</p>
<p>We shall then ascertain who it is who can be saved by fire, if we first discover what it is
to have Christ for a foundation. And this we may very readily learn from the image itself.
In a building the foundation is first. Whoever, then, has Christ in his heart, so that no
earthly or temporal things—not even those that are legitimate and allowed—are preferred
to Him, has Christ as a foundation. But if these things be preferred, then even though a
man seem to have faith in Christ, yet Christ is not the foundation to that man; and much
more if he, in contempt of wholesome precepts, seek forbidden gratifications, is he clearly
convicted of putting Christ not first but last, since he has despised Him as his ruler, and has
preferred to fulfill his own wicked lusts, in contempt of Christ’s commands and allowances.
Accordingly, if any Christian man loves a harlot, and, attaching himself to her, becomes
one body, he has not now Christ for a foundation. But if any one loves his own wife, and
loves her as Christ would have him love her, who can doubt that he has Christ for a foundation?
But if he loves her in the world’s fashion, carnally, as the disease of lust prompts him,
and as the Gentiles love who know not God, even this the apostle, or rather Christ by the
apostle, allows as a venial fault. And therefore even such a man may have Christ for a
foundation. For so long as he does not prefer such an affection or pleasure to Christ, Christ
is his foundation, though on it he builds wood, hay, stubble; and therefore he shall be saved
as by fire. For the fire of affliction shall burn such luxurious pleasures and earthly loves,
though they be not damnable, because enjoyed in lawful wedlock. And of this fire the fuel
is bereavement, and all those calamities which consume these joys. Consequently the superstructure
will be loss to him who has built it, for he shall not retain it, but shall be agonized
<note type="footnote">1571 Jas. ii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">1572 1 Cor. iii. 15. [This is the chief passage quoted in favor of purgatory. See note on p. 470. The Apostle

<pb n="1076"/>
by the loss of those things in the enjoyment of which he found pleasure. But by this fire he
shall be saved through virtue of the foundation, because even if a persecutor demanded
whether he would retain Christ or these things, he would prefer Christ. Would you hear,
in the apostle’s own words, who he is who builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious
stones? “He that is unmarried,” he says, “careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how
he may please the Lord.”1573 Would you hear who he is that buildeth wood, hay, stubble?
“But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his
wife.1574 “Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it,”—the day,
no doubt, of tribulation—“because,” says he, “it shall be revealed by fire.”1575 He calls
tribulation fire, just as it is elsewhere said, “The furnace proves the vessels of the potter, and
the trial of affliction righteous men.”1576 And “The fire shall try every man’s work of what
sort it is. If any man’s work abide”—for a man’s care for the things of the Lord, how he may
please the Lord, abides—“which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward,”—that
is, he shall reap the fruit of his care. “But if any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer
loss,”—for what he loved he shall not retain:—“ but he himself shall be saved,”—for no
tribulation shall have moved him from that stable foundation,—“yet so as by fire;”1577 for
that which he possessed with the sweetness of love he does not lose without the sharp sting
of pain. Here, then, as seems to me, we have a fire which destroys neither, but enriches the
one, brings loss to the other, proves both.</p>
<p>But if this passage <del>of Corinthians</del> is to interpret that fire of which the Lord shall say
to those on His left hand, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,”1578 so that
among these we are to believe there are those who build on the foundation wood, hay,
stubble, and that they, through virtue of the good foundation, shall after a time be liberated
from the fire that is the award of their evil deserts, what then shall we think of those on the
right hand, to whom it shall be said, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you,”1579 unless that they are those who have built on the foundation gold,
silver, precious stones? But if the fire of which our Lord speaks is the same as that of which
the apostle says, “Yet so as by fire,” then both—that is to say, both those on the right as well
as those on the left—are to be cast into it. For that fire is to try both, since it is said, “For
the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try

<pb n="1077"/>
every man’s work of what sort it is.”1580 If, therefore, the fire shall try both, in order that if
any man’s work abide—i.e., if the superstructure be not consumed by the fire—he may receive
a reward, and that if his work is burned he may suffer loss, certainly that fire is not the
eternal fire itself. For into this latter fire only those on the left hand shall be cast, and that
with final and everlasting doom; but that former fire proves those on the right hand. But
some of them it so proves that it does not burn and consume the structure which is found
to have been built by them on Christ as the foundation; while others of them it proves in
another fashion, so as to burn what they have built up, and thus cause them to suffer loss,
while they themselves are saved because they have retained Christ, who was laid as their
sure foundation, and have loved Him above all. But if they are saved, then certainly they
shall stand at the right hand, and shall with the rest hear the sentence, “Come, ye blessed of
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you;” and not at the left hand, where those
shall be who shall not be saved, and shall therefore hear the doom, “Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire.” For from that fire no man shall be saved, because they all shall
go away into eternal punishment, where their worms shall not die, nor their fire be quenched,
in which they shall be tormented day and night for ever.</p>
<p>But if it be said that in the interval of time between the death of this body and that last
day of judgment and retribution which shall follow the resurrection, the bodies of the dead
shall be exposed to a fire of such a nature that it shall not affect those who have not in this
life indulged in such pleasures and pursuits as shall be consumed like wood, hay, stubble,
but shall affect those others who have carried with them structures of that kind; if it be said
that such worldliness, being venial, shall be consumed in the fire of tribulation either here
only, or here and hereafter both, or here that it may not be hereafter,—this I do not contradict,
because possibly it is true. For perhaps even the death of the body is itself a part of this
tribulation, for it results from the first transgression, so that the time which follows death
takes its color in each case from the nature of the man’s building. The persecutions, too,
which have crowned the martyrs, and which Christians of all kinds suffer, try both buildings
like a fire, consuming some, along with the builders themselves, if Christ is not found in
them as their foundation, while others they consume without the builders, because Christ
is found in them, and they are saved, though with loss; and other buildings still they do not
consume, because such materials as abide for ever are found in them. In the end of the
world there shall be in the time of Antichrist tribulation such as has never before been.
How many edifices there shall then be, of gold or of hay, built on the best foundation, Christ
Jesus, which that fire shall prove, bringing joy to some, loss to others, but without destroying
either sort, because of this stable foundation! But whosoever prefers, I do not say his wife,
with whom he lives for carnal pleasure, but any of those relatives who afford no delight of
<note type="footnote">1580 1 Cor. iii. 13.</note>

<pb n="1078"/>
such a kind, and whom it is right to love,—whosoever prefers these to Christ, and loves
them after a human and carnal fashion, has not Christ as a foundation, and will therefore
not be saved by fire, nor indeed at all; for he shall not possibly dwell with the Saviour, who
says very explicitly concerning this very matter, “He that loveth father or mother more than
me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of
me.”1581 But he who loves his relations carnally, and yet so that he does not prefer them to
Christ, but would rather want them than Christ if he were put to the proof, shall be saved
by fire, because it is necessary that by the loss of these relations he suffer pain in proportion
to his love. And he who loves father, mother, sons, daughters, according to Christ, so that
he aids them in obtaining His kingdom and cleaving to Him, or loves them because they
are members of Christ, God forbid that this love should be consumed as wood, hay, stubble,
and not rather be reckoned a structure of gold, silver, precious stones. For how can a man
love those more than Christ whom he loves only for Christ’s sake?</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Against the Belief of Those Who Think that the Sins Which Have Been
Accompanied with Almsgiving Will Do Them No Harm.</head>
<p>It remains to reply to those who maintain that those only shall burn in eternal fire who
neglect alms-deeds proportioned to their sins, resting this opinion on the words of the
Apostle James, “He shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy.”1582
Therefore, they say, he that hath showed mercy, though he has not reformed his dissolute
conduct, but has lived wickedly and iniquitously even while abounding in alms, shall have
a merciful judgment, so that he shall either be not condemned at all, or shall be delivered
from final judgment after a time. And for the same reason they suppose that Christ will
discriminate between those on the right hand and those on the left, and will send the one
party into His kingdom, the other into eternal punishment, on the sole ground of their attention
to or neglect of works of charity. Moreover, they endeavor to use the prayer which
the Lord Himself taught as a proof and bulwark of their opinion, that daily sins which are
never abandoned can be expiated through alms-deeds, no matter how offensive or of what
sort they be. For, say they, as there is no day on which Christians ought not to use this
prayer, so there is no sin of any kind which, though committed every day, is not remitted
when we say, “Forgive us our debts,” if we take care to fulfill what follows, “as we forgive
our debtors.”1583 For, they go on to say, the Lord does not say, “If ye forgive men their
trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you your little daily sins,” but “will forgive you
your sins.” Therefore, be they of any kind or magnitude whatever, be they perpetrated daily
and never abandoned or subdued in this life, they can be pardoned, they presume, through
alms-deeds.</p>
<p>But they are right to inculcate the giving of aims proportioned to past sins; for if they
said that any kind of alms could obtain the divine pardon of great sins committed daily and
with habitual enormity, if they said that such sins could thus be daily remitted, they would
see that their doctrine was absurd and ridiculous. For they would thus be driven to acknowledge
that it were possible for a very wealthy man to buy absolution from murders, adulteries,
and all manner of wickedness, by paying a daily alms of ten paltry coins. And if it be most
absurd and insane to make such an acknowledgment, and if we still ask what are those fitting
alms of which even the forerunner of Christ said, “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance,”
1584 undoubtedly it will be found that they are not such as are done by men who
undermine their life by daily enormities even to the very end. For they suppose that by
giving to the poor a small fraction of the wealth they acquire by extortion and spoliation
they can propitiate Christ, so that they may with impunity commit the most damnable sins,
<note type="footnote">1582 Jas. ii. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">1583 Matt. vi. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">1584 Matt. iii. 8.</note>

<pb n="1080"/>
in the persuasion that they have bought from Him a license to transgress, or rather do buy
a daily indulgence. And if they for one crime have distributed all their goods to Christ’s
needy members, that could profit them nothing unless they desisted from all similar actions,
and attained charity which worketh no evil He therefore who does alms-deeds proportioned
to his sins must first begin with himself. For it is not reasonable that a man who exercises
charity towards his neighbor should not do so towards himself, since he hears the Lord
saying, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,”1585 and again, “Have compassion on thy
soul, and please God.”1586 He then who has not compassion on his own soul that he may
please God, how can he be said to do alms-deeds proportioned to his sins? To the same
purpose is that written, “He who is bad to himself, to whom can he be good?”1587 We ought
therefore to do alms that we may be heard when we pray that our past sins may be forgiven,
not that while we continue in them we may think to provide ourselves with a license for
wickedness by alms-deeds.</p>
<p>The reason, therefore, of our predicting that He will impute to those on His right hand
the alms-deeds they have done, and charge those on His left with omitting the same, is that
He may thus show the efficacy of charity for the deletion of past sins, not for impunity in
their perpetual commission. And such persons, indeed, as decline to abandon their evil
habits of life for a better course cannot be said to do charitable deeds. For this is the purport
of the saying, “Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.”1588
He shows them that they do not perform charitable actions even when they think they are
doing so. For if they gave bread to a hungering Christian because he is a Christian, assuredly
they would not deny to themselves the bread of righteousness, that is, Christ Himself; for
God considers not the person to whom the gift is made, but the spirit in which it is made.
He therefore who loves Christ in a Christian extends alms to him in the same spirit in which
he draws near to Christ, not in that spirit which would abandon Christ if it could do so with
impunity. For in proportion as a man loves what Christ disapproves does he himself
abandon Christ. For what does it profit a man that he is baptized, if he is not justified? Did
not He who said, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into
the kingdom of God,”1589 say also, “Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven?”1590 Why do
many through fear of the first saying run to baptism, while few through fear of the second

<pb n="1081"/>
seek to be justified? As therefore it is not to his brother a man says, “Thou fool,” if when
he says it he is indignant not at the brotherhood, but at the sin of the offender,—for otherwise
he were guilty of hell fire,—so he who extends charity to a Christian does not extend it to a
Christian if he does not love Christ in him. Now he does not love Christ who refuses to be
justified in Him. Or, again, if a man has been guilty of this sin of calling his brother Fool,
unjustly reviling him without any desire to remove his sin, his alms-deeds go a small way
towards expiating this fault, unless he adds to this the remedy of reconciliation which the
same passage enjoins. For it is there said, “Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and
there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave there thy gift before the
altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.”1591
Just so it is a small matter to do alms-deeds, no matter how great they be, for any sin, so
long as the offender continues in the practice of sin.</p>
<p>Then as to the daily prayer which the Lord Himself taught, and which is therefore called
the Lord’s prayer, it obliterates indeed the sins of the day, when day by day we say, “Forgive
us our debts,” and when we not only say but act out that which follows, “as we forgive our
debtors;”1592 but we utter this petition because sins have been committed, and not that they
may be. For by it our Saviour designed to teach us that, however righteously we live in this
life of infirmity and darkness, we still commit sins for the remission of which we ought to
pray, while we must pardon those who sin against us that we ourselves also may be pardoned.
The Lord then did not utter the words, “If ye forgive men their trespasses, your Father will
also forgive you your trespasses,”1593 in order that we might contract from this petition
such confidence as should enable us to sin securely from day to day, either putting ourselves
above the fear of human laws, or craftily deceiving men concerning our conduct, but in order
that we might thus learn not to suppose that we are without sins, even though we should
be free from crimes; as also God admonished the priests of the old law to this same effect
regarding their sacrifices, which He commanded them to offer first for their own sins, and
then for the sins of the people. For even the very words of so great a Master and Lord are
to be intently considered. For He does not say, If ye forgive men their sins, your Father will
also forgive you your sins, no matter of what sort they be, but He says, your sins; for it was
a daily prayer He was teaching, and it was certainly to disciples already justified He was
speaking. What, then, does He mean by “your sins,” but those sins from which not even
you who are justified and sanctified can be free? While, then, those who seek occasion from
this petition to indulge in habitual sin maintain that the Lord meant to include great sins,
because He did not say, He will forgive you your small sins, but “your sins,” we, on the

<pb n="1082"/>
other hand, taking into account the character of the persons He was addressing, cannot see
our way to interpret the expression “your sins” of anything but small sins, because such
persons are no longer guilty of great sins. Nevertheless not even great sins themselves—sins
from which we must flee with a total reformation of life—are forgiven to those who pray,
unless they observe the appended precept, “as ye also forgive your debtors.” For if the very
small sins which attach even to the life of the righteous be not remitted without that condition,
how much further from obtaining indulgence shall those be who are involved in many
great crimes, if, while they cease from perpetrating such enormities, they still inexorably
refuse to remit any debt incurred to themselves, since the Lord says, “But if ye forgive not
men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses?”1594 For this is the
purport of the saying of the Apostle James also, “He shall have judgment without mercy
that hath showed no mercy.”1595 For we should remember that servant whose debt of ten
thousand talents his lord cancelled, but afterwards ordered him to pay up, because the servant
himself had no pity for his fellow-servant, who owed him an hundred pence.1596 The words
which the Apostle James subjoins,“And mercy rejoiceth against judgment,”1597 find their
application among those who are the children of the promise and vessels of mercy. For
even those righteous men, who have lived with such holiness that they receive into the
eternal habitations others also who have won their friendship with the mammon of unrighteousness,
1598 became such only through the merciful deliverance of Him who justifies the
ungodly, imputing to him a reward according to grace, not according to debt. For among
this number is the apostle, who says, “I obtained mercy to be faithful.”1599</p>
<p>But it must be admitted, that those who are thus received into the eternal habitations
are not of such a character that their own life would suffice to rescue them without the aid
of the saints, and consequently in their case especially does mercy rejoice against judgment.
And yet we are not on this account to suppose that every abandoned profligate, who has
made no amendment of his life, is to be received into the eternal habitations if only he has
assisted the saints with the mammon of unrighteousness,—that is to say, with money or
wealth which has been unjustly acquired, or, if rightfully acquired, is yet not the true riches,
but only what iniquity counts riches, because it knows not the true riches in which those
persons abound, who even receive others also into eternal habitations. There is then a certain
kind of life, which is neither, on the one hand, so bad that those who adopt it are not helped

towards the kingdom of heaven by any bountiful alms-giving by which they may relieve the
wants of the saints, and make friends who could receive them into eternal habitations, nor,
on the other hand, so good that it of itself suffices to win for them that great blessedness, if
they do not obtain mercy through the merits of those whom they have made their friends.
And I frequently wonder that even Virgil should give expression to this sentence of the
Lord, in which He says, “Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,
that they may receive you into everlasting habitations;”1600 and this very similar saying,
“He that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward; and
he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous
man’s reward.”1601 For when that poet described the Elysian fields, in which they suppose
that the souls of the blessed dwell, he placed there not only those who had been able by their
own merit to reach that abode, but added,—
<lg>
<l>“And they who grateful memory won</l>
<l>By services to others done;”1602</l>
</lg>
that is, they who had served others, and thereby merited to be remembered by them.
Just as if they used the expression so common in Christian lips, where some humble person
commends himself to one of the saints, and says, Remember me, and secures that he do so
by deserving well at his hand. But what that kind of life we have been speaking of is, and
what those sins are which prevent a man from winning the kingdom of God by himself, but
yet permit him to avail himself of the merits of the saints, it is very difficult to ascertain,
very perilous to define. For my own part, in spite of all investigation, I have been up to the
present hour unable to discover this. And possibly it is hidden from us, lest we should become
careless in avoiding such sins, and so cease to make progress. For if it were known
what these sins are which, though they continue, and be not abandoned for a higher life, do
yet not prevent us from seeking and hoping for the intercession of the saints, human sloth
would presumptuously wrap itself in these sins, and would take no steps to be disentangled
from such wrappings by the deft energy of any virtue, but would only desire to be rescued
by the merits of other people, whose friendship had been won by a bountiful use of the
mammon of unrighteousness. But now that we are left in ignorance of the precise nature
of that iniquity which is venial, even though it be persevered in, certainly we are both more
vigilant in our prayers and efforts for progress, and more careful to secure with the mammon
of unrighteousness friends for ourselves among the saints.</p>
<p>But this deliverance, which is effected by one’s own prayers, or the intercession of holy
men, secures that a man be not cast into eternal fire, but not that, when once he has been

<pb n="1084"/>
cast into it, he should after a time be rescued from it. For even those who fancy that what
is said of the good ground bringing forth abundant fruit, some thirty, some sixty, some an
hundred fold, is to be referred to the saints, so that in proportion to their merits some of
them shall deliver thirty men, some sixty, some an hundred,—even those who maintain this
are yet commonly inclined to suppose that this deliverance will take place at, and not after
the day of judgment. Under this impression, some one who observed the unseemly folly
with which men promise themselves impunity on the ground that all will be included in
this method of deliverance, is reported to have very happily remarked, that we should rather
endeavor to live so well that we shall be all found among the number of those who are to
intercede for the liberation of others, lest these should be so few in number, that, after they
have delivered one thirty, another sixty, another a hundred, there should still remain many
who could not be delivered from punishment by their intercessions, and among them every
one who has vainly and rashly promised himself the fruit of another’s labor. But enough
has been said in reply to those who acknowledge the authority of the same sacred Scriptures
as ourselves, but who, by a mistaken interpretation of them, conceive of the future rather
as they themselves wish, than as the Scriptures teach. And having given this reply, I now,

<head>Chapter 1.—Of the Creation of Angels and Men.</head>
<p>As we promised in the immediately preceeding book, this, the last of the whole work,
shall contain a discussion of the eternal blessedness of the city of God. This blessedness is
named eternal, not because it shall endure for many ages, though at last it shall come to an
end, but because, according to the words of the gospel, “of His kingdom there shall be no
end.”1603 Neither shall it enjoy the mere appearance of perpetuity which is maintained by
the rise of fresh generations to occupy the place of those that have died out, as in an evergreen
the same freshness seems to continue permanently, and the same appearance of dense foliage
is preserved by the growth of fresh leaves in the room of those that have withered and fallen;
but in that city all the citizens shall be immortal, men now for the first time enjoying what
the holy angels have never lost. And this shall be accomplished by God, the most almighty
Founder of the city. For He has promised it, and cannot lie, and has already performed
many of His promises, and has done many unpromised kindnesses to those whom He now
asks to believe that He will do this also.</p>
<p>For it is He who in the beginning created the world full of all visible and intelligible
beings, among which He created nothing better than those spirits whom He endowed with
intelligence, and made capable of contemplating and enjoying Him, and united in our society,
which we call the holy and heavenly city, and in which the material of their sustenance and
blessedness is God Himself, as it were their common food and nourishment. It is He who
gave to this intellectual nature free-will of such a kind, that if he wished to forsake God,
i.e., his blessedness, misery should forthwith result. It is He who, when He foreknew that
certain angels would in their pride desire to suffice for their own blessedness, and would
forsake their great good, did not deprive them of this power, deeming it to be more befitting
His power and goodness to bring good out of evil than to prevent the evil from coming into
existence. And indeed evil had never been, had not the mutable nature—mutable, though
good, and created by the most high God and immutable Good, who created all things
good—brought evil upon itself by sin. And this its sin is itself proof that its nature was originally
good. For had it not been very good, though not equal to its Creator, the desertion
of God as its light could not have been an evil to it. For as blindness is a vice of the eye, and
this very fact indicates that the eye was created to see the light, and as, consequently, vice
itself proves that the eye is more excellent than the other members, because it is capable of
light (for on no other supposition would it be a vice of the eye to want light), so the nature
which once enjoyed God teaches, even by its very vice, that it was created the best of all,
since it is now miserable because it does not enjoy God. It is he who with very just punishment
doomed the angels who voluntarily fell to everlasting misery, and rewarded those who
continued in their attachment to the supreme good with the assurance of endless stability
<note type="footnote">1603 Luke i. 33.</note>

<pb n="1087"/>
as the meed of their fidelity. It is He who made also man himself upright, with the same
freedom of will,—an earthly animal, indeed, but fit for heaven if he remained faithful to his
Creator, but destined to the misery appropriate to such a nature if he forsook Him. It is He
who when He foreknew that man would in his turn sin by abandoning God and breaking
His law, did not deprive him of the power of free-will, because He at the same time foresaw
what good He Himself would bring out of the evil, and how from this mortal race, deservedly
and justly condemned, He would by His grace collect, as now He does, a people so numerous,
that He thus fills up and repairs the blank made by the fallen angels, and that thus that beloved
and heavenly city is not defrauded of the full number of its citizens, but perhaps may even
rejoice in a still more overflowing population.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Of the Eternal and Unchangeable Will of God.</head>
<p>It is true that wicked men do many things contrary to God’s will; but so great is His
wisdom and power, that all things which seem adverse to His purpose do still tend towards
those just and good ends and issues which He Himself has foreknown. And consequently,
when God is said to change His will, as when, e.g., He becomes angry with those to whom
He was gentle, it is rather they than He who are changed, and they find Him changed in so
far as their experience of suffering at His hand is new, as the sun is changed to injured eyes,
and becomes as it were fierce from being mild, and hurtful from being delightful, though
in itself it remains the same as it was. That also is called the will of God which He does in
the hearts of those who obey His commandments; and of this the apostle says, “For it is God
that worketh in you both to will.”1604 As God’s “righteousness” is used not only of the
righteousness wherewith He Himself is righteous, but also of that which He produces in the
man whom He justifies, so also that is called His law, which, though given by God, is rather
the law of men. For certainly they were men to whom Jesus said, “It is written in your
law,”1605 though in another place we read, “The law of his God is in his heart.”1606 According
to this will which God works in men, He is said also to will what He Himself does not will,
but causes His people to will; as He is said to know what He has caused those to know who
were ignorant of it. For when the apostle says, “But now, after that ye have known God, or
rather are known of God,”1607 we cannot suppose that God there for the first time knew
those who were foreknown by Him before the foundation of the world; but He is said to
have known them then, because then He caused them to know. But I remember that I discussed
these modes of expression in the preceding books. According to this will, then, by
which we say that God wills what He causes to be willed by others, from whom the future
is hidden, He wills many things which He does not perform.</p>
<p>Thus His saints, inspired by His holy will, desire many things which never happen.
They pray, e.g., for certain individuals—they pray in a pious and holy manner—but what
they request He does not perform, though He Himself by His own Holy Spirit has wrought
in them this will to pray. And consequently, when the saints, in conformity with God’s
mind, will and pray that all men be saved, we can use this mode of expression: God wills
and does not perform,—meaning that He who causes them to will these things Himself wills
them. But if we speak of that will of His which is eternal as His foreknowledge, certainly
He has already done all things in heaven and on earth that He has willed,—not only past
and present things, but even things still future. But before the arrival of that time in which

He has willed the occurrence of what He foreknew and arranged before all time, we say, It
will happen when God wills. But if we are ignorant not only of the time in which it is to be,
but even whether it shall be at all, we say, It will happen if God wills,—not because God will
then have a new will which He had not before, but because that event, which from eternity
has been prepared in His unchangeable will, shall then come to pass.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Of the Promise of Eternal Blessedness to the Saints, and Everlasting
Punishment to the Wicked.</head>
<p>Wherefore, not to mention many other instances besides, as we now see in Christ the
fulfillment of that which God promised to Abraham when He said, “In thy seed shall all
nations be blessed,”1608 so this also shall be fulfilled which He promised to the same race,
when He said by the prophet, “They that are in their sepulchres shall rise again,”1609 and
also, “There shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and the former shall not be mentioned,
nor come into mind; but they shall find joy and rejoicing in it: for I will make Jerusalem a
rejoicing, and my people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people, and
the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her.”1610 And by another prophet He uttered
the same prediction: “At that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be
found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust” (or, as some interpret
it, “in the mound”) “of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame
and everlasting contempt.”1611 And in another place by the same prophet: “The saints of
the Most High shall take the kingdom, and shall possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever
and ever.”1612 And a little after he says, “His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.”1613
Other prophecies referring to the same subject I have advanced in the twentieth book, and
others still which I have not advanced are found written in the same Scriptures; and these
predictions shall be fulfilled, as those also have been which unbelieving men supposed would
be frustrate. For it is the same God who promised both, and predicted that both would
come to pass,—the God whom the pagan deities tremble before, as even Porphyry, the

<head>Chapter 4.—Against the Wise Men of the World, Who Fancy that the Earthly Bodies
of Men Cannot Be Transferred to a Heavenly Habitation.</head>
<p>But men who use their learning and intellectual ability to resist the force of that great
authority which, in fulfillment of what was so long before predicted, has converted all races
of men to faith and hope in its promises, seem to themselves to argue acutely against the
resurrection of the body while they cite what Cicero mentions in the third book De Republica.
For when he was asserting the apotheosis of Hercules and Romulus, he says: “Whose bodies
were not taken up into heaven; for nature would not permit a body of earth to exist anywhere
except upon earth.” This, forsooth, is the profound reasoning of the wise men, whose
thoughts God knows that they are vain. For if we were only souls, that is, spirits without
any body, and if we dwelt in heaven and had no knowledge of earthly animals, and were
told that we should be bound to earthly bodies by some wonderful bond of union, and
should animate them, should we not much more vigorously refuse to believe this, and
maintain that nature would not permit an incorporeal substance to be held by a corporeal
bond? And yet the earth is full of living spirits, to which terrestrial bodies are bound, and
with which they are in a wonderful way implicated. If, then, the same God who has created
such beings wills this also, what is to hinder the earthly body from being raised to a heavenly
body, since a spirit, which is more excellent than all bodies, and consequently than even a
heavenly body, has been tied to an earthly body? If so small an earthly particle has been
able to hold in union with itself something better than a heavenly body, so as to receive
sensation and life, will heaven disdain to receive, or at least to retain, this sentient and living
particle, which derives its life and sensation from a substance more excellent than any
heavenly body? If this does not happen now, it is because the time is not yet come which
has been determined by Him who has already done a much more marvellous thing than
that which these men refuse to believe. For why do we not more intensely wonder that incorporeal
souls, which are of higher rank than heavenly bodies, are bound to earthly bodies,
rather than that bodies, although earthly, are exalted to an abode which, though heavenly,
is yet corporeal, except because we have been accustomed to see this, and indeed are this,
while we are not as yet that other marvel, nor have as yet ever seen it? Certainly, if we consult
sober reason, the more wonderful of the two divine works is found to be to attach somehow
corporeal things to incorporeal, and not to connect earthly things with heavenly, which,
though diverse, are yet both of them corporeal.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Of the Resurrection of the Flesh, Which Some Refuse to Believe, Though
the World at Large Believes It.</head>
<p>But granting that this was once incredible, behold, now, the world has come to the belief
that the earthly body of Christ was received up into heaven. Already both the learned and
unlearned have believed in the resurrection of the flesh and its ascension to the heavenly
places, while only a very few either of the educated or uneducated are still staggered by it.
If this is a credible thing which is believed, then let those who do not believe see how stolid
they are; and if it is incredible, then this also is an incredible thing, that what is incredible
should have received such credit. Here then we have two incredibles,—to wit, the resurrection
of our body to eternity, and that the world should believe so incredible a thing; and both
these incredibles the same God predicted should come to pass before either had as yet oc-
curred. We see that already one of the two has come to pass, for the world has believed
what was incredible; why should we despair that the remaining one shall also come to pass,
and that this which the world believed, though it was incredible, shall itself occur? For
already that which was equally incredible has come to pass, in the world’s believing an incredible
thing. Both were incredible: the one we see accomplished, the other we believe
shall be; for both were predicted in those same Scriptures by means of which the world believed.
And the very manner in which the world’s faith was won is found to be even more
incredible if we consider it. Men uninstructed in any branch of a liberal education, without
any of the refinement of heathen learning, unskilled in grammar, not armed with dialectic,
not adorned with rhetoric, but plain fishermen, and very few in number,—these were the
men whom Christ sent with the nets of faith to the sea of this world, and thus took out of
every race so many fishes, and even the philosophers themselves, wonderful as they are rare.
Let us add, if you please, or because you ought to be pleased, this third incredible thing to
the two former. And now we have three incredibles, all of which have yet come to pass. It
is incredible that Jesus Christ should have risen in the flesh and ascended with flesh into
heaven; it is incredible that the world should have believed so incredible a thing; it is incredible
that a very few men, of mean birth and the lowest rank, and no education, should have
been able so effectually to persuade the world, and even its learned men, of so incredible a
thing. Of these three incredibles, the parties with whom we are debating refuse to believe
the first; they cannot refuse to see the second, which they are unable to account for if they
do not believe the third. It is indubitable that the resurrection of Christ, and His ascension
into heaven with the flesh in which He rose, is already preached and believed in the whole
world. If it is not credible, how is it that it has already received credence in the whole world?
If a number of noble, exalted, and learned men had said that they had witnessed it, and had
been at pains to publish what they had witnessed, it were not wonderful that the world
should have believed it, but it were very stubborn to refuse credence; but if, as is true, the
world has believed a few obscure, inconsiderable, uneducated persons, who state and write

<pb n="1093"/>
that they witnessed it, is it not unreasonable that a handful of wrong-headed men should
oppose themselves to the creed of the whole world, and refuse their belief? And if the world
has put faith in a small number of men, of mean birth and the lowest rank, and no education,
it is because the divinity of the thing itself appeared all the more manifestly in such contemptible
witnesses. The eloquence, indeed, which lent persuasion to their message, consisted of
wonderful works, not words. For they who had not seen Christ risen in the flesh, nor ascending
into heaven with His risen body, believed those who related how they had seen
these things, and who testified not only with words but wonderful signs. For men whom
they knew to be acquainted with only one, or at most two languages, they marvelled to hear
speaking in the tongues of all nations. They saw a man, lame from his mother’s womb, after
forty years stand up sound at their word in the name of Christ; that handkerchiefs taken
from their bodies had virtue to heal the sick; that countless persons, sick of various diseases,
were laid in a row in the road where they were to pass, that their shadow might fall on them
as they walked, and that they forthwith received health; that many other stupendous miracles
were wrought by them in the name of Christ; and, finally, that they even raised the dead.
If it be admitted that these things occurred as they are related, then we have a multitude of
incredible things to add to those three incredibles. That the one incredibility of the resurrection
and ascension of Jesus Christ may be believed, we accumulate the testimonies of
countless incredible miracles, but even so we do not bend the frightful obstinacy of these
sceptics. But if they do not believe that these miracles were wrought by Christ’s apostles to
gain credence to their preaching of His resurrection and ascension, this one grand miracle
suffices for us, that the whole world has believed without any miracles.</p>

<pb n="1094"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—That Rome Made Its Founder Romulus a God Because It Loved Him;
But the Church Loved Christ Because It Believed Him to Be God.</head>
<p>Let us here recite the passage in which Tully expresses his astonishment that the apotheosis
of Romulus should have been credited. I shall insert his words as they stand: “It is
most worthy of remark in Romulus, that other men who are said to have become gods lived
in less educated ages, when there was a greater propensity to the fabulous, and when the
uninstructed were easily persuaded to believe anything. But the age of Romulus was barely
six hundred years ago, and already literature and science had dispelled the errors that attach
to an uncultured age.” And a little after he says of the same Romulus words to this effect:
“From this we may perceive that Homer had flourished long before Romulus, and that there
was now so much learning in individuals, and so generally diffused an enlightenment, that
scarcely any room was left for fable. For antiquity admitted fables, and sometimes even
very clumsy ones; but this age <del>of Romulus</del> was sufficiently enlightened to reject whatever
had not the air of truth.” Thus one of the most learned men, and certainly the most eloquent,
M. Tullius Cicero, says that it is surprising that the divinity of Romulus was believed in,
because the times were already so enlightened that they would not accept a fabulous fiction.
But who believed that Romulus was a god except Rome, which was itself small and in its
infancy? Then afterwards it was necessary that succeeding generations should preserve the
tradition of their ancestors; that, drinking in this superstition with their mother’s milk, the
state might grow and come to such power that it might dictate this belief, as from a point
of vantage, to all the nations over whom its sway extended. And these nations, though they
might not believe that Romulus was a god, at least said so, that they might not give offence
to their sovereign state by refusing to give its founder that title which was given him by
Rome, which had adopted this belief, not by a love of error, but an error of love. But though
Christ is the founder of the heavenly and eternal city, yet it did not believe Him to be God
because it was founded by Him, but rather it is founded by Him, in virtue of its belief. Rome,
after it had been built and dedicated, worshipped its founder in a temple as a god; but this
Jerusalem laid Christ, its God, as its foundation, that the building and dedication might
proceed. The former city loved its founder, and therefore believed him to be a god; the latter
believed Christ to be God, and therefore loved Him. There was an antecedent cause for the
love of the former city, and for its believing that even a false dignity attached to the object
of its love; so there was an antecedent cause for the belief of the latter, and for its loving the
true dignity which a proper faith, not a rash surmise, ascribed to its object. For, not to
mention the multitude of very striking miracles which proved that Christ is God, there were
also divine prophecies heralding Him, prophecies most worthy of belief, which being already
accomplished, we have not, like the fathers, to wait for their verification. Of Romulus, on
the other hand, and of his building Rome and reigning in it, we read or hear the narrative
of what did take place, not prediction which beforehand said that such things should be.

<pb n="1095"/>
And so far as his reception among the gods is concerned, history only records that this was
believed, and does not state it as a fact; for no miraculous signs testified to the truth of this.
For as to that wolf which is said to have nursed the twin-brothers, and which is considered
a great marvel, how does this prove him to have been divine? For even supposing that this
nurse was a real wolf and not a mere courtezan, yet she nursed both brothers, and Remus
is not reckoned a god. Besides, what was there to hinder any one from asserting that Romulus
or Hercules, or any such man, was a god? Or who would rather choose to die than profess
belief in his divinity? And did a single nation worship Romulus among its gods, unless it
were forced through fear of the Roman name? But who can number the multitudes who
have chosen death in the most cruel shapes rather than deny the divinity of Christ? And
thus the dread of some slight indignation, which it was supposed, perhaps groundlessly,
might exist in the minds of the Romans, constrained some states who were subject to Rome
to worship Romulus as a god; whereas the dread, not of a slight mental shock, but of severe
and various punishments, and of death itself, the most formidable of all, could not prevent
an immense multitude of martyrs throughout the world from not merely worshipping but
also confessing Christ as God. The city of Christ, which, although as yet a stranger upon
earth, had countless hosts of citizens, did not make war upon its godless persecutors for the
sake of temporal security, but preferred to win eternal salvation by abstaining from war.
They were bound, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, burned, torn in pieces, massacred, and yet
they multiplied. It was not given to them to fight for their eternal salvation except by despising
their temporal salvation for their Saviour’s sake.</p>
<p>I am aware that Cicero, in the third book of his De Republica, if I mistake not, argues
that a first-rate power will not engage in war except either for honor or for safety. What he
has to say about the question of safety, and what he means by safety, he explains in another
place, saying, “Private persons frequently evade, by a speedy death, destitution, exile, bonds,
the scourge, and the other pains which even the most insensible feel. But to states, death,
which seems to emancipate individuals from all punishments, is itself a punishment; for a
state should be so constituted as to be eternal. And thus death is not natural to a republic
as to a man, to whom death is not only necessary, but often even desirable. But when a state
is destroyed, obliterated, annihilated, it is as if (to compare great things with small) this
whole world perished and collapsed.” Cicero said this because he, with the Platonists, believed
that the world would not perish. It is therefore agreed that, according to Cicero, a state
should engage in war for the safety which preserves the state permanently in existence
though its citizens change; as the foliage of an olive or laurel, or any tree of this kind, is
perennial, the old leaves being replaced by fresh ones. For death, as he says, is no punishment
to individuals, but rather delivers them from all other punishments, but it is a punishment
to the state. And therefore it is reasonably asked whether the Saguntines did right when
they chose that their whole state should perish rather than that they should break faith with

<pb n="1096"/>
the Roman republic; for this deed of theirs is applauded by the citizens of the earthly republic.
But I do not see how they could follow the advice of Cicero, who tell us that no war is to be
undertaken save for safety or for honor; neither does he say which of these two is to be
preferred, if a case should occur in which the one could not be preserved without the loss
of the other. For manifestly, if the Saguntines chose safety, they must break faith; if they
kept faith, they must reject safety; as also it fell out. But the safety of the city of God is such
that it can be retained, or rather acquired, by faith and with faith; but if faith be abandoned,
no one can attain it. It is this thought of a most steadfast and patient spirit that has made
so many noble martyrs, while Romulus has not had, and could not have, so much as one to
die for his divinity.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—That the World’s Belief in Christ is the Result of Divine Power, Not of
Human Persuasion.</head>
<p>But it is thoroughly ridiculous to make mention of the false divinity of Romulus as any
way comparable to that of Christ. Nevertheless, if Romulus lived about six hundred years
before Cicero, in an age which already was so enlightened that it rejected all impossibilities,
how much more, in an age which certainly was more enlightened, being six hundred years
later, the age of Cicero himself, and of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius, would the human
mind have refused to listen to or believe in the resurrection of Christ’s body and its ascension
into heaven, and have scouted it as an impossibility, had not the divinity of the truth itself,
or the truth of the divinity, and corroborating miraculous signs, proved that it could happen
and had happened? Through virtue of these testimonies, and notwithstanding the opposition
and terror of so many cruel persecutions, the resurrection and immortality of the flesh, first
in Christ, and subsequently in all in the new world, was believed, was intrepidly proclaimed,
and was sown over the whole world, to be fertilized richly with the blood of the martyrs.
For the predictions of the prophets that had preceded the events were read, they were corroborated
by powerful signs, and the truth was seen to be not contradictory to reason, but
only different from customary ideas, so that at length the world embraced the faith it had
furiously persecuted.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—Of Miracles Which Were Wrought that the World Might Believe in
Christ, and Which Have Not Ceased Since the World Believed.</head>
<p>Why, they say, are those miracles, which you affirm were wrought formerly, wrought
no longer? I might, indeed, reply that miracles were necessary before the world believed,
in order that it might believe. And whoever now-a-days demands to see prodigies that he
may believe, is himself a great prodigy, because he does not believe, though the whole world
does. But they make these objections for the sole purpose of insinuating that even those
former miracles were never wrought. How, then, is it that everywhere Christ is celebrated
with such firm belief in His resurrection and ascension? How is it that in enlightened times,
in which every impossibility is rejected, the world has, without any miracles, believed things
marvellously incredible? Or will they say that these things were credible, and therefore were
credited? Why then do they themselves not believe? Our argument, therefore, is a summary
one—either incredible things which were not witnessed have caused the world to believe
other incredible things which both occurred and were witnessed, or this matter was so
credible that it needed no miracles in proof of it, and therefore convicts these unbelievers
of unpardonable scepticism. This I might say for the sake of refuting these most frivolous
objectors. But we cannot deny that many miracles were wrought to confirm that one grand
and health-giving miracle of Christ’s ascension to heaven with the flesh in which He rose.
For these most trustworthy books of ours contain in one narrative both the miracles that
were wrought and the creed which they were wrought to confirm. The miracles were pub-
lished that they might produce faith, and the faith which they produced brought them into
greater prominence. For they are read in congregations that they may be believed, and yet
they would not be so read unless they were believed. For even now miracles are wrought
in the name of Christ, whether by His sacraments or by the prayers or relics of His saints;
but they are not so brilliant and conspicuous as to cause them to be published with such
glory as accompanied the former miracles. For the canon of the sacred writings, which behoved
to be closed,1614 causes those to be everywhere recited, and to sink into the memory
of all the congregations; but these modern miracles are scarcely known even to the whole
population in the midst of which they are wrought, and at the best are confined to one spot.
For frequently they are known only to a very few persons, while all the rest are ignorant of
them, especially if the state is a large one; and when they are reported to other persons in
other localities, there is no sufficient authority to give them prompt and unwavering credence,
although they are reported to the faithful by the faithful.</p>
<p>The miracle which was wrought at Milan when I was there, and by which a blind man
was restored to sight, could come to the knowledge of many; for not only is the city a large
one, but also the emperor was there at the time, and the occurrence was witnessed by an
<note type="footnote">1614 Another reading has diffamatum, “published.”</note>

<pb n="1099"/>
immense concourse of people that had gathered to the bodies of the martyrs Protasius and
Gervasius, which had long lain concealed and unknown, but were now made known to the
bishop Ambrose in a dream, and discovered by him. By virtue of these remains the darkness
of that blind man was scattered, and he saw the light of day.1615</p>
<p>But who but a very small number are aware of the cure which was wrought upon Innocentius,
ex-advocate of the deputy prefecture, a cure wrought at Carthage, in my presence,
and under my own eyes? For when I and my brother Alypius,1616 who were not yet clergymen,
1617 though already servants of God, came from abroad, this man received us, and
made us live with him, for he and all his household were devotedly pious. He was being
treated by medical men for fistulæ, of which he had a large number intricately seated in the
rectum. He had already undergone an operation, and the surgeons were using every means
at their command for his relief. In that operation he had suffered long-continued and acute
pain; yet, among the many folds of the gut, one had escaped the operators so entirely, that,
though they ought to have laid it open with the knife, they never touched it. And thus,
though all those that had been opened were cured, this one remained as it was, and frustrated
all their labor. The patient, having his suspicions awakened by the delay thus occasioned,
and fearing greatly a second operation, which another medical man—one of his own domestics—
had told him he must undergo, though this man had not even been allowed to
witness the first operation, and had been banished from the house, and with difficulty allowed
to come back to his enraged master’s presence,—the patient, I say, broke out to the surgeons,
saying, “Are you going to cut me again? Are you, after all, to fulfill the prediction of that
man whom you would not allow even to be present?” The surgeons laughed at the unskillful
doctor, and soothed their patient’s fears with fair words and promises. So several days
passed, and yet nothing they tried did him good. Still they persisted in promising that they
<note type="footnote">1615 A somewhat fuller account of this miracle is given by Augustin in the Confessions, ix. 16. See also Serm.
286, and Ambrose, Ep. 22. A translation of this epistle in full is given in Isaac Taylor’s Ancient Christianity, ii.
242, where this miracle is taken as a specimen of the so-called miracles of that age, and submitted to a detailed
examination. The result arrived at will be gathered from the following sentence: “In the Nicene Church, so lax
were the notions of common morality, and in so feeble a manner did the fear of God influence the conduct of
leading men, that, on occasions when the Church was to be served, and her assailants to be confounded, they
did not scruple to take upon themselves the contrivance and execution of the most degrading impostures.”—P.
270. It is to be observed, however, that Augustin was, at least in this instance, one of the deceived. [On Augustin’s
views on post-apostolic miracles see Card. Newman, Essay on Miracles, Nitzsch, Augustinus Lehre vom Wunder
(Berlin, 1865) and Schaff, Church History, vol. iii. 460, sqq.—P.S.]</note>

would cure that fistula by drugs, without the knife. They called in also another old practitioner
of great repute in that department, Ammonius (for he was still alive at that time);
and he, after examining the part, promised the same result as themselves from their care
and skill. On this great authority, the patient became confident, and, as if already well,
vented his good spirits in facetious remarks at the expense of his domestic physician, who
had predicted a second operation. To make a long story short, after a number of days had
thus uselessly elapsed, the surgeons, wearied and confused, had at last to confess that he
could only be cured by the knife. Agitated with excessive fear, he was terrified, and grew
pale with dread; and when he collected himself and was able to speak, he ordered them to
go away and never to return. Worn out with weeping, and driven by necessity, it occurred
to him to call in an Alexandrian, who was at that time esteemed a wonderfully skillful operator,
that he might perform the operation his rage would not suffer them to do. But when
he had come, and examined with a professional eye the traces of their careful work, he acted
the part of a good man, and persuaded his patient to allow those same hands the satisfaction
of finishing his cure which had begun it with a skill that excited his admiration, adding that
there was no doubt his only hope of a cure was by an operation, but that it was thoroughly
inconsistent with his nature to win the credit of the cure by doing the little that remained
to be done, and rob of their reward men whose consummate skill, care, and diligence he
could not but admire when be saw the traces of their work. They were therefore again received
to favor; and it was agreed that, in the presence of the Alexandrian, they should operate
on the fistula, which, by the consent of all, could now only be cured by the knife. The
operation was deferred till the following day. But when they had left, there arose in the
house such a wailing, in sympathy with the excessive despondency of the master, that it
seemed to us like the mourning at a funeral, and we could scarcely repress it. Holy men
were in the habit of visiting him daily; Saturninus of blessed memory, at that time bishop
of Uzali, and the presbyter Gelosus, and the deacons of the church of Carthage; and among
these was the bishop Aurelius, who alone of them all survives,—a man to be named by us
with due reverence,—and with him I have often spoken of this affair, as we conversed together
about the wonderful works of God, and I have found that he distinctly remembers
what I am now relating. When these persons visited him that evening according to their
custom, he besought them, with pitiable tears, that they would do him the honor of being
present next day at what he judged his funeral rather than his suffering. For such was the
terror his former pains had produced, that he made no doubt he would die in the hands of
the surgeons. They comforted him, and exhorted him to put his trust in God, and nerve
his will like a man. Then we went to prayer; but while we, in the usual way, were kneeling
and bending to the ground, he cast himself down, as if some one were hurling him violently
to the earth, and began to pray; but in what a manner, with what earnestness and emotion,
with what a flood of tears, with what groans and sobs, that shook his whole body, and almost

<pb n="1101"/>
prevented him speaking, who can describe! Whether the others prayed, and had not their
attention wholly diverted by this conduct, I do not know. For myself, I could not pray at
all. This only I briefly said in my heart: “O Lord, what prayers of Thy people dost Thou
hear if Thou hearest not these?” For it seemed to me that nothing could be added to this
prayer, unless he expired in praying. We rose from our knees, and, receiving the blessing
of the bishop, departed, the patient beseeching his visitors to be present next morning, they
exhorting him to keep up his heart. The dreaded day dawned. The servants of God were
present, as they had promised to be; the surgeons arrived; all that the circumstances required
was ready; the frightful instruments are produced; all look on in wonder and suspense.
While those who have most influence with the patient are cheering his fainting spirit, his
limbs are arranged on the couch so as to suit the hand of the operator; the knots of the
bandages are untied; the part is bared; the surgeon examines it, and, with knife in hand,
eagerly looks for the sinus that is to be cut. He searches for it with his eyes; he feels for it
with his finger; he applies every kind of scrutiny: he finds a perfectly firm cicatrix! No
words of mine can describe the joy, and praise, and thanksgiving to the merciful and almighty
God which was poured from the lips of all, with tears of gladness. Let the scene be imagined
rather than described!</p>
<p>In the same city of Carthage lived Innocentia, a very devout woman of the highest rank
in the state. She had cancer in one of her breasts, a disease which, as physicians say, is incurable.
Ordinarily, therefore, they either amputate, and so separate from the body the
member on which the disease has seized, or, that the patient’s life may be prolonged a little,
though death is inevitable even if somewhat delayed, they abandon all remedies, following,
as they say, the advice of Hippocrates. This the lady we speak of had been advised to by a
skillful physician, who was intimate with her family; and she betook herself to God alone
by prayer. On the approach of Easter, she was instructed in a dream to wait for the first
woman that came out from the baptistery1618 after being baptized, and to ask her to make
the sign of Christ upon her sore. She did so, and was immediately cured. The physician
who had advised her to apply no remedy if she wished to live a little longer, when he had
examined her after this, and found that she who, on his former examination, was afflicted
with that disease was now perfectly cured, eagerly asked her what remedy she had used,
anxious, as we may well believe, to discover the drug which should defeat the decision of
Hippocrates. But when she told him what had happened, he is said to have replied, with

down till towards the end of the sixth century. Tertullian thinks these the most appropriate times, but says that

<pb n="1102"/>
reli gious politeness, though with a contemptuous tone, and an expression which made her
fear he would utter some blasphemy against Christ, “I thought you would make some great
discovery to me.” She, shuddering at his indifference, quickly replied, “What great thing
was it for Christ to heal a cancer, who raised one who had been four days dead?” When,
therefore, I had heard this, I was extremely indignant that so great a miracle wrought in that
well-known city, and on a person who was certainly not obscure, should not be divulged,
and I considered that she should be spoken to, if not reprimanded on this score. And when
she replied to me that she had not kept silence on the subject, I asked the women with whom
she was best acquainted whether they had ever heard of this before. They told me they knew
nothing of it. “See,” I said, “what your not keeping silence amounts to, since not even those
who are so familiar with you know of it.” And as I had only briefly heard the story, I made
her tell how the whole thing happened, from beginning to end, while the other women
listened in great astonishment, and glorified God.</p>
<p>A gouty doctor of the same city, when he had given in his name for baptism, and had
been prohibited the day before his baptism from being baptized that year, by black woollyhaired
boys who appeared to him in his dreams, and whom he understood to be devils, and
when, though they trod on his feet, and inflicted the acutest pain he had ever yet experienced,
he refused to obey them, but overcame them, and would not defer being washed in the laver
of regeneration, was relieved in the very act of baptism, not only of the extraordinary pain
he was tortured with, but also of the disease itself, so that, though he lived a long time afterwards,
he never suffered from gout; and yet who knows of this miracle? We, however, do
know it, and so, too, do the small number of brethren who were in the neighborhood, and
to whose ears it might come.</p>
<p>An old comedian of Curubis1619 was cured at baptism not only of paralysis, but also of
hernia, and, being delivered from both afflictions, came up out of the font of regeneration
as if he had had nothing wrong with his body. Who outside of Curubis knows of this, or
who but a very few who might hear it elsewhere? But we, when we heard of it, made the
man come to Carthage, by order of the holy bishop Aurelius, although we had already ascertained
the fact on the information of persons whose word we could not doubt.</p>
<p>Hesperius, of a tribunitian family, and a neighbor of our own,1620 has a farm called
Zubedi in the Fussalian district;1621 and, finding that his family, his cattle, and his servants
were suffering from the malice of evil spirits, he asked our presbyters, during my absence,
that one of them would go with him and banish the spirits by his prayers. One went, offered
there the sacrifice of the body of Christ, praying with all his might that that vexation might

cease. It did cease forthwith, through God’s mercy. Now he had received from a friend of
his own some holy earth brought from Jerusalem, where Christ, having been buried, rose
again the third day. This earth he had hung up in his bedroom to preserve himself from
harm. But when his house was purged of that demoniacal invasion, he began to consider
what should be done with the earth; for his reverence for it made him unwilling to have it
any longer in his bedroom. It so happened that I and Maximinus bishop of Synita, and then
my colleague, were in the neighborhood. Hesperius asked us to visit him, and we did so.
When he had related all the circumstances, he begged that the earth might be buried
somewhere, and that the spot should be made a place of prayer where Christians might assemble
for the worship of God. We made no objection: it was done as he desired. There
was in that neighborhood a young countryman who was paralytic, who, when he heard of
this, begged his parents to take him without delay to that holy place. When he had been
brought there, he prayed, and forthwith went away on his own feet perfectly cured.</p>
<p>There is a country-seat called Victoriana, less than thirty miles from Hippo-regius. At
it there is a monument to the Milanese martyrs, Protasius and Gervasius. Thither a young
man was carried, who, when he was watering his horse one summer day at noon in a pool
of a river, had been taken possession of by a devil. As he lay at the monument, near death,
or even quite like a dead person, the lady of the manor, with her maids and religious attendants,
entered the place for evening prayer and praise, as her custom was, and they began to
sing hymns. At this sound the young man, as if electrified, was thoroughly aroused, and
with frightful screaming seized the altar, and held it as if he did not dare or were not able
to let it go, and as if he were fixed or tied to it; and the devil in him, with loud lamentation,
besought that he might be spared, and confessed where and when and how he took possession
of the youth. At last, declaring that he would go out of him, he named one by one the parts
of his body which he threatened to mutilate as he went out and with these words he departed
from the man. But his eye, falling out on his cheek, hung by a slender vein as by a root, and
the whole of the pupil which had been black became white. When this was witnessed by
those present (others too had now gathered to his cries, and had all joined in prayer for
him), although they were delighted that he had recovered his sanity of mind, yet, on the
other hand, they were grieved about his eye, and said he should seek medical advice. But
his sister’s husband, who had brought him there, said, “God, who has banished the devil, is
able to restore his eye at the prayers of His saints.” Therewith he replaced the eye that was
fallen out and hanging, and bound it in its place with his handkerchief as well as he could,
and advised him not to loose the bandage for seven days. When he did so, he found it quite
healthy. Others also were cured there, but of them it were tedious to speak.</p>
<p>I know that a young woman of Hippo was immediately dispossessed of a devil, on
anointing herself with oil, mixed with the tears of the prebsyter who had been praying for

<pb n="1104"/>
her. I know also that a bishop once prayed for a demoniac young man whom he never saw,
and that he was cured on the spot.</p>
<p>There was a fellow-townsman of ours at Hippo, Florentius, an old man, religious and
poor, who supported himself as a tailor. Having lost his coat, and not having means to buy
another, he prayed to the Twenty Martyrs,1622 who have a very celebrated memorial shrine
in our town, begging in a distinct voice that he might be clothed. Some scoffing young men,
who happened to be present, heard him, and followed him with their sarcasm as he went
away, as if he had asked the martyrs for fifty pence to buy a coat. But he, walking on in silence,
saw on the shore a great fish, gasping as if just cast up, and having secured it with the
good-natured assistance of the youths, he sold it for curing to a cook of the name of Catosus,
a good Christian man, telling him how he had come by it, and receiving for it three hundred
pence, which he laid out in wool, that his wife might exercise her skill upon, and make into
a coat for him. But, on cutting up the fish, the cook found a gold ring in its belly; and
forthwith, moved with compassion, and influenced, too, by religious fear, gave it up to the
man, saying, “See how the Twenty Martyrs have clothed you.”</p>
<p>When the bishop Projectus was bringing the relics of the most glorious martyr Stephen
to the waters of Tibilis, a great concourse of people came to meet him at the shrine. There
a blind woman entreated that she might be led to the bishop who was carrying the relics.
He gave her the flowers he was carrying. She took them, applied them to her eyes, and
forthwith saw. Those who were present were astounded, while she, with every expression
of joy, preceded them, pursuing her way without further need of a guide.</p>
<p>Lucillus bishop of Sinita, in the neighborhood of the colonial town of Hippo, was carrying
in procession some relics of the same martyr, which had been deposited in the castle of
Sinita. A fistula under which he had long labored, and which his private physician was
watching an opportunity to cut, was suddenly cured by the mere carrying of that sacred
fardel,1623—at least, afterwards there was no trace of it in his body.</p>
<p>Eucharius, a Spanish priest, residing at Calama, was for a long time a sufferer from
stone. By the relics of the same martyr, which the bishop Possidius brought him, he was
cured. Afterwards the same priest, sinking under another disease, was lying dead, and
already they were binding his hands. By the succor of the same martyr he was raised to life,
the priest’s cloak having been brought from the oratory and laid upon the corpse.</p>
<p>There was there an old nobleman named Martial, who had a great aversion to the
Christian religion, but whose daughter was a Christian, while her husband had been baptized
that same year. When he was ill, they besought him with tears and prayers to become a
Christian, but he positively refused, and dismissed them from his presence in a storm of

indignation. It occurred to the son-in-law to go to the oratory of St. Stephen, and there pray
for him with all earnestness that God might give him a right mind, so that he should not
delay believing in Christ. This he did with great groaning and tears, and the burning fervor
of sincere piety; then, as he left the place, he took some of the flowers that were lying there,
and, as it was already night, laid them by his father’s head, who so slept. And lo! before
dawn, he cries out for some one to run for the bishop; but he happened at that time to be
with me at Hippo. So when he had heard that he was from home, he asked the presbyters
to come. They came. To the joy and amazement of all, he declared that he believed, and
he was baptized. As long as he remained in life, these words were ever on his lips: “Christ,
receive my spirit,” though he was not aware that these were the last words of the most blessed
Stephen when he was stoned by the Jews. They were his last words also, for not long after
he himself also gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>There, too, by the same martyr, two men, one a citizen, the other a stranger, were cured
of gout; but while the citizen was absolutely cured, the stranger was only informed what he
should apply when the pain returned; and when he followed this advice, the pain was at
once relieved.</p>
<p>Audurus is the name of an estate, where there is a church that contains a memorial
shrine of the martyr Stephen. It happened that, as a little boy was playing in the court, the
oxen drawing a wagon went out of the track and crushed him with the wheel, so that immediately
he seemed at his last gasp. His mother snatched him up, and laid him at the shrine,
and not only did he revive, but also appeared uninjured.</p>
<p>A religious female, who lived at Caspalium, a neighboring estate, when she was so ill as
to be despaired of, had her dress brought to this shrine, but before it was brought back she
was gone. However, her parents wrapped her corpse in the dress, and, her breath returning,
she became quite well.</p>
<p>At Hippo a Syrian called Bassus was praying at the relics of the same martyr for his
daughter, who was dangerously ill. He too had brought her dress with him to the shrine.
But as he prayed, behold, his servants ran from the house to tell him she was dead. His
friends, however, intercepted them, and forbade them to tell him, lest he should bewail her
in public. And when he had returned to his house, which was already ringing with the
lamentations of his family, and had thrown on his daughter’s body the dress he was carrying,
she was restored to life.</p>
<p>There, too, the son of a man, Irenæus, one of our tax-gatherers, took ill and died. And
while his body was lying lifeless, and the last rites were being prepared, amidst the weeping
and mourning of all, one of the friends who were consoling the father suggested that the
body should be anointed with the oil of the same martyr. It was done, and he revived.</p>

<pb n="1106"/>
<p>Likewise Eleusinus, a man of tribunitian rank among us, laid his infant son, who had
died, on the shrine of the martyr, which is in the suburb where he lived, and, after prayer,
which he poured out there with many tears, he took up his child alive.</p>
<p>What am I to do? I am so pressed by the promise of finishing this work, that I cannot
record all the miracles I know; and doubtless several of our adherents, when they read what
I have narrated, will regret that I have omitted so many which they, as well as I, certainly
know. Even now I beg these persons to excuse me, and to consider how long it would take
me to relate all those miracles, which the necessity of finishing the work I have undertaken
forces me to omit. For were I to be silent of all others, and to record exclusively the miracles
of healing which were wrought in the district of Calama and of Hippo by means of this
martyr—I mean the most glorious Stephen—they would fill many volumes; and yet all even
of these could not be collected, but only those of which narratives have been written for
public recital. For when I saw, in our own times, frequent signs of the presence of divine
powers similar to those which had been given of old, I desired that narratives might be
written, judging that the multitude should not remain ignorant of these things. It is not yet
two years since these relics were first brought to Hippo-regius, and though many of the
miracles which have been wrought by it have not, as I have the most certain means of
knowing, been recorded, those which have been published amount to almost seventy at the
hour at which I write. But at Calama, where these relics have been for a longer time, and
where more of the miracles were narrated for public information, there are incomparably
more.</p>
<p>At Uzali, too, a colony near Utica, many signal miracles were, to my knowledge, wrought
by the same martyr, whose relics had found a place there by direction of the bishop Evodius,
long before we had them at Hippo. But there the custom of publishing narratives does not
obtain, or, I should say, did not obtain, for possibly it may now have been begun. For, when
I was there recently, a woman of rank, Petronia, had been miraculously cured of a serious
illness of long standing, in which all medical appliances had failed, and, with the consent of
the above-named bishop of the place, I exhorted her to publish an account of it that might
be read to the people. She most promptly obeyed, and inserted in her narrative a circumstance
which I cannot omit to mention, though I am compelled to hasten on to the subjects
which this work requires me to treat. She said that she had been persuaded by a Jew to wear
next her skin, under all her clothes, a hair girdle, and on this girdle a ring, which, instead
of a gem, had a stone which had been found in the kidneys of an ox. Girt with this charm,
she was making her way to the threshold of the holy martyr. But, after leaving Carthage,
and when she had been lodging in her own demesne on the river Bagrada, and was now
rising to continue her journey, she saw her ring lying before her feet. In great surprise she
examined the hair girdle, and when she found it bound, as it had been, quite firmly with
knots, she conjectured that the ring had been worn through and dropped off; but when she

<pb n="1107"/>
found that the ring was itself also perfectly whole, she presumed that by this great miracle
she had received somehow a pledge of her cure, whereupon she untied the girdle, and cast
it into the river, and the ring along with it. This is not credited by those who do not believe
either that the Lord Jesus Christ came forth from His mother’s womb without destroying
her virginity, and entered among His disciples when the doors were shut; but let them make
strict inquiry into this miracle, and if they find it true, let them believe those others. The
lady is of distinction, nobly born, married to a nobleman. She resides at Carthage. The city
is distinguished, the person is distinguished, so that they who make inquiries cannot fail to
find satisfaction. Certainly the martyr himself, by whose prayers she was healed, believed
on the Son of her who remained a virgin; on Him who came in among the disciples when
the doors were shut; in fine,—and to this tends all that we have been retailing,—on Him
who ascended into heaven with the flesh in which He had risen; and it is because he laid
down his life for this faith that such miracles were done by his means.</p>
<p>Even now, therefore, many miracles are wrought, the same God who wrought those we
read of still performing them, by whom He will and as He will; but they are not as well
known, nor are they beaten into the memory, like gravel, by frequent reading, so that they
cannot fall out of mind. For even where, as is now done among ourselves, care is taken that
the pamphlets of those who receive benefit be read publicly, yet those who are present hear
the narrative but once, and many are absent; and so it comes to pass that even those who
are present forget in a few days what they heard, and scarcely one of them can be found who
will tell what he heard to one who he knows was not present.</p>
<p>One miracle was wrought among ourselves, which, though no greater than those I have
mentioned, was yet so signal and conspicuous, that I suppose there is no inhabitant of Hippo
who did not either see or hear of it, none who could possibly forget it. There were seven
brothers and three sisters of a noble family of the Cappadocian Cæsarea, who were cursed
by their mother, a new-made widow, on account of some wrong they had done her, and
which she bitterly resented, and who were visited with so severe a punishment from Heaven,
that all of them were seized with a hideous shaking in all their limbs. Unable, while
presenting this loathsome appearance, to endure the eyes of their fellow-citizens, they
wandered over almost the whole Roman world, each following his own direction. Two of
them came to Hippo, a brother and a sister, Paulus and Palladia, already known in many
other places by the fame of their wretched lot. Now it was about fifteen days before Easter
when they came, and they came daily to church, and specially to the relics of the most
glorious Stephen, praying that God might now be appeased, and restore their former health.
There, and wherever they went, they attracted the attention of every one. Some who had
seen them elsewhere, and knew the cause of their trembling, told others as occasion offered.
Easter arrived, and on the Lord’s day, in the morning, when there was now a large crowd
present, and the young man was holding the bars of the holy place where the relics were,

<pb n="1108"/>
and praying, suddenly he fell down, and lay precisely as if asleep, but not trembling as he
was wont to do even in sleep. All present were astonished. Some were alarmed, some were
moved with pity; and while some were for lifting him up, others prevented them, and said
they should rather wait and see what would result. And behold! he rose up, and trembled
no more, for he was healed, and stood quite well, scanning those who were scanning him.
Who then refrained himself from praising God? The whole church was filled with the voices
of those who were shouting and congratulating him. Then they came running to me, where
I was sitting ready to come into the church. One after another they throng in, the last comer
telling me as news what the first had told me already; and while I rejoiced and inwardly gave
God thanks, the young man himself also enters, with a number of others, falls at my knees,
is raised up to receive my kiss. We go in to the congregation: the church was full, and
ringing with the shouts of joy, “Thanks to God! Praised be God!” every one joining and
shouting on all sides, “I have healed the people,” and then with still louder voice shouting
again. Silence being at last obtained, the customary lessons of the divine Scriptures were
read. And when I came to my sermon, I made a few remarks suitable to the occasion and
the happy and joyful feeling, not desiring them to listen to me, but rather to consider the
eloquence of God in this divine work. The man dined with us, and gave us a careful ac
count of his own, his mother’s, and his family’s calamity. Accordingly, on the following
day, after delivering my sermon, I promised that next day I would read his narrative to the
people.1624 And when I did so, the third day after Easter Sunday, I made the brother and
sister both stand on the steps of the raised place from which I used to speak; and while they
stood there their pamphlet was read.1625 The whole congregation, men and women alike,
saw the one standing without any unnatural movement, the other trembling in all her limbs;
so that those who had not before seen the man himself saw in his sister what the divine
compassion had removed from him. In him they saw matter of congratulation, in her subject
for prayer. Meanwhile, their pamphlet being finished, I instructed them to withdraw from
the gaze of the people; and I had begun to discuss the whole matter somewhat more carefully,
when lo! as I was proceeding, other voices are heard from the tomb of the martyr, shouting
new congratulations. My audience turned round, and began to run to the tomb. The young
woman, when she had come down from the steps where she had been standing, went to
pray at the holy relics, and no sooner had she touched the bars than she, in the same way
as her brother, collapsed, as if falling asleep, and rose up cured. While, then, we were asking
what had happened, and what occasioned this noise of joy, they came into the basilica where
we were, leading her from the martyr’s tomb in perfect health. Then, indeed, such a shout
of wonder rose from men and women together, that the exclamations and the tears seemed
<note type="footnote">1624 See Augustin’s Sermons, 321.</note>
<note type="footnote">1625 Sermon, 322.</note>

<pb n="1109"/>
like never to come to an end. She was led to the place where she had a little before stood
trembling. They now rejoiced that she was like her brother, as before they had mourned
that she remained unlike him; and as they had not yet uttered their prayers in her behalf,
they perceived that their intention of doing so had been speedily heard. They shouted God’s
praises without words, but with such a noise that our ears could scarcely bear it. What was
there in the hearts of these exultant people but the faith of Christ, for which Stephen had
shed his blood?</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—That All the Miracles Which are Done by Means of the Martyrs in the
Name of Christ Testify to that Faith Which the Martyrs Had in Christ.</head>
<p>To what do these miracles witness, but to this faith which preaches Christ risen in the
flesh, and ascended with the same into heaven? For the martyrs themselves were martyrs,
that is to say, witnesses of this faith, drawing upon themselves by their testimony the hatred
of the world, and conquering the world not by resisting it, but by dying. For this faith they
died, and can now ask these benefits from the Lord in whose name they were slain. For this
faith their marvellous constancy was exercised, so that in these miracles great power was
manifested as the result. For if the resurrection of the flesh to eternal life had not taken
place in Christ, and were not to be accomplished in His people, as predicted by Christ, or
by the prophets who foretold that Christ was to come, why do the martyrs who were slain
for this faith which proclaims the resurrection possess such power? For whether God
Himself wrought these miracles by that wonderful manner of working by which, though
Himself eternal, He produces effects in time; or whether He wrought them by servants, and
if so, whether He made use of the spirits of martyrs as He uses men who are still in the body,
or effects all these marvels by means of angels, over whom He exerts an invisible, immutable,
incorporeal sway, so that what is said to be done by the martyrs is done not by their operation,
but only by their prayer and request; or whether, finally, some things are done in one way,
others in another, and so that man cannot at all comprehend them,—nevertheless these
miracles attest this faith which preaches the resurrection of the flesh to eternal life.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—That the Martyrs Who Obtain Many Miracles in Order that the True
God May Be Worshipped, are Worthy of Much Greater Honor Than the Demons,
Who Do Some Marvels that They Themselves May Be Supposed to Be God.</head>
<p>Here perhaps our adversaries will say that their gods also have done some wonderful
things, if now they begin to compare their gods to our dead men. Or will they also say that
they have gods taken from among dead men, such as Hercules, Romulus, and many others
whom they fancy to have been received into the number of the gods? But our martyrs are
not our gods; for we know that the martyrs and we have both but one God, and that the
same. Nor yet are the miracles which they maintain to have been done by means of their
temples at all comparable to those which are done by the tombs of our martyrs. If they seem
similar, their gods have been defeated by our martyrs as Pharaoh’s magi were by Moses.
In reality, the demons wrought these marvels with the same impure pride with which they
aspired to be the gods of the nations; but the martyrs do these wonders, or rather God does
them while they pray and assist, in order that an impulse may be given to the faith by which
we believe that they are not our gods, but have, together with ourselves, one God. In fine,
they built temples to these gods of theirs, and set up altars, and ordained priests, and appointed
sacrifices; but to our martyrs we build, not temples as if they were gods, but monuments
as to dead men whose spirits live with God. Neither do we erect altars at these monuments
that we may sacrifice to the martyrs, but to the one God of the martyrs and of ourselves;
and in this sacrifice they are named in their own place and rank as men of God who
conquered the world by confessing Him, but they are not invoked by the sacrificing priest.
For it is to God, not to them, he sacrifices, though he sacrifices at their monument; for he
is God’s priest, not theirs. The sacrifice itself, too, is the body of Christ, which is not offered
to them, because they themselves are this body. Which then can more readily be believed
to work miracles? They who wish themselves to be reckoned gods by those on whom they
work miracles, or those whose sole object in working any miracle is to induce faith in God,
and in Christ also as God? They who wished to turn even their crimes into sacred rites, or
those who are unwilling that even their own praises be consecrated, and seek that everything
for which they are justly praised be ascribed to the glory of Him in whom they are praised?
For in the Lord their souls are praised. Let us therefore believe those who both speak the
truth and work wonders. For by speaking the truth they suffered, and so won the power of
working wonders. And the leading truth they professed is that Christ rose from the dead,

<head>Chapter 11.—Against the Platonists, Who Argue from the Physical Weight of the
Elements that an Earthly Body Cannot Inhabit Heaven.</head>
<p>But against this great gift of God, these reasoners, “whose thoughts the Lord knows that
they are vain”1626 bring arguments from the weights of the elements; for they have been
taught by their master Plato that the two greatest elements of the world, and the furthest
removed from one another, are coupled and united by the two intermediate, air and water.
And consequently they say, since the earth is the first of the elements, beginning from the
base of the series, the second the water above the earth, the third the air above the water,
the fourth the heaven above the air, it follows that a body of earth cannot live in the heaven;
for each element is poised by its own weight so as to preserve its own place and rank. Behold
with what arguments human infirmity, possessed with vanity, contradicts the omnipotence
of God! What, then, do so many earthly bodies do in the air, since the air is the third element
from the earth? Unless perhaps He who has granted to the earthly bodies of birds that they
be carried through the air by the lightness of feathers and wings, has not been able to confer
upon the bodies of men made immortal the power to abide in the highest heaven. The
earthly animals, too, which cannot fly, among which are men, ought on these terms to live
under the earth, as fishes, which are the animals of the water, live under the water. Why,
then, can an animal of earth not live in the second element, that is, in water, while it can in
the third? Why, though it belongs to the earth, is it forthwith suffocated if it is forced to
live in the second element next above earth, while it lives in the third, and cannot live out
of it? Is there a mistake here in the order of the elements, or is not the mistake rather in
their reasonings, and not in the nature of things? I will not repeat what I said in the thirteenth
book,1627 that many earthly bodies, though heavy like lead, receive from the workman’s
hand a form which enables them to swim in water; and yet it is denied that the omnipotent
Worker can confer on the human body a property which shall enable it to pass into heaven
and dwell there.</p>
<p>But against what I have formerly said they can find nothing to say, even though they
introduce and make the most of this order of the elements in which they confide. For if the
order be that the earth is first, the water second, the air third, the heaven fourth, then the
soul is above all. For Aristotle said that the soul was a fifth body, while Plato denied that it
was a body at all. If it were a fifth body, then certainly it would be above the rest; and if it
is not a body at all, so much the more does it rise above all. What, then, does it do in an
<note type="footnote">1626 Ps. xciv. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">1627 C. 18.</note>

<pb n="1113"/>
earthly body? What does this soul, which is finer than all else, do in such a mass of matter
as this? What does the lightest of substances do in this ponderosity? this swiftest substance
in such sluggishness? Will not the body be raised to heaven by virtue of so excellent a nature
as this? and if now earthly bodies can retain the souls below, shall not the souls be one day
able to raise the earthly bodies above?</p>
<p>If we pass now to their miracles which they oppose to our martyrs as wrought by their
gods, shall not even these be found to make for us, and help out our argument? For if any
of the miracles of their gods are great, certainly that is a great one which Varro mentions
of a vestal virgin, who, when she was endangered by a false accusation of unchastity, filled
a sieve with water from the Tiber, and carried it to her judges without any part of it leaking.
Who kept the weight of water in the sieve? Who prevented any drop from falling from it
through so many open holes? They will answer, Some god or some demon. If a god, is he
greater than the God who made the world? If a demon, is he mightier than an angel who
serves the God by whom the world was made? If, then, a lesser god, angel, or demon could
so sustain the weight of this liquid element that the water might seem to have changed its
nature, shall not Almighty God, who Himself created all the elements, be able to eliminate
from the earthly body its heaviness, so that the quickened body shall dwell in whatever element
the quickening spirit pleases?</p>
<p>Then, again, since they give the air a middle place between the fire above and the water
beneath, how is it that we often find it between water and water, and between the water and
the earth? For what do they make of those watery clouds, between which and the seas air
is constantly found intervening? I should like to know by what weight and order of the
elements it comes to pass that very violent and stormy torrents are suspended in the clouds
above the earth before they rush along upon the earth under the air. In fine, why is it that
throughout the whole globe the air is between the highest heaven and the earth, if its place
is between the sky and the water, as the place of the water is between the sky and the earth?</p>
<p>Finally, if the order of the elements is so disposed that, as Plato thinks, the two extremes,
fire and earth, are united by the two means, air and water, and that the fire occupies the
highest part of the sky, and the earth the lowest part, or as it were the foundation of the
world, and that therefore earth cannot be in the heavens, how is fire in the earth? For, according
to this reasoning, these two elements, earth and fire, ought to be so restricted to
their own places, the highest and the lowest, that neither the lowest can rise to the place of
the highest, nor the highest sink to that of the lowest. Thus, as they think that no particle
of earth is or shall ever be in the sky so we ought to see no particle of fire on the earth. But
the fact is that it exists to such an extent, not only on but even under the earth, that the tops
of mountains vomit it forth; besides that we see it to exist on earth for human uses, and even
to be produced from the earth, since it is kindled from wood and stones, which are without
doubt earthly bodies. But that [upper] fire, they say, is tranquil, pure, harmless, eternal; but

<pb n="1114"/>
this <del>earthly</del> fire is turbid, smoky, corruptible, and corrupting. But it does not corrupt the
mountains and caverns of the earth in which it rages continually. But grant that the earthly
fire is so unlike the other as to suit its earthly position, why then do they object to our believing
that the nature of earthly bodies shall some day be made incorruptible and fit for
the sky, even as now fire is corruptible and suited to the earth? They therefore adduce from
their weights and order of the elements nothing from which they can prove that it is impossible
for Almighty God to make our bodies such that they can dwell in the skies.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Against the Calumnies with Which Unbelievers Throw Ridicule Upon
the Christian Faith in the Resurrection of the Flesh.</head>
<p>But their way is to feign a scrupulous anxiety in investigating this question, and to cast
ridicule on our faith in the resurrection of the body, by asking, Whether abortions shall
rise? And as the Lord says, “Verily I say unto you, not a hair of your head shall perish,”1628
shall all bodies have an equal stature and strength, or shall there be differences in size? For
if there is to be equality, where shall those abortions, supposing that they rise again, get that
bulk which they had not here? Or if they shall not rise because they were not born but cast
out, they raise the same question about children who have died in childhood, asking us
whence they get the stature which we see they had not here; for we will not say that those
who have been not only born, but born again, shall not rise again. Then, further, they ask
of what size these equal bodies shall be. For if all shall be as tall and large as were the tallest
and largest in this world, they ask us how it is that not only children but many full-grown
persons shall receive what they here did not possess, if each one is to receive what he had
here. And if the saying of the apostle, that we are all to come to the “measure of the age of
the fullness of Christ,”1629 or that other saying, “Whom He predestinated to be conformed
to the image of His Son,”1630 is to be understood to mean that the stature and size of Christ’s
body shall be the measure of the bodies of all those who shall be in His kingdom, then, say
they, the size and height of many must be diminished; and if so much of the bodily frame
itself be lost, what becomes of the saying, “Not a hair of your head shall perish?” Besides,
it might be asked regarding the hair itself, whether all that the barber has cut off shall be
restored? And if it is to be restored, who would not shrink from such deformity? For as
the same restoration will be made of what has been pared off the nails, much will be replaced
on the body which a regard for its appearance had cut off. And where, then, will be its
beauty, which assuredly ought to be much greater in that immortal condition than it could
be in this corruptible state? On the other hand, if such things are not restored to the body,
they must perish; how, then, they say, shall not a hair of the head perish? In like manner
they reason about fatness and leanness; for if all are to be equal, then certainly there shall
not be some fat, others lean. Some, therefore, shall gain, others lose something. Consequently
there will not be a simple restoration of what formerly existed, but, on the one hand, an
addition of what had no existence, and, on the other, a loss of what did before exist.</p>
<p>The difficulties, too, about the corruption and dissolution of dead bodies,—that one is
turned into dust, while another evaporates into the air; that some are devoured by beasts,
some by fire, while some perish by shipwreck or by drowning in one shape or other, so that

<pb n="1116"/>
their bodies decay into liquid, these difficulties give them immoderate alarm, and they believe
that all those dissolved elements cannot be gathered again and reconstructed into a body.
They also make eager use of all the deformities and blemishes which either accident or birth
has produced, and accordingly, with horror and derision, cite monstrous births, and ask if
every deformity will be preserved in the resurrection. For if we say that no such thing shall
be reproduced in the body of a man, they suppose that they confute us by citing the marks
of the wounds which we assert were found in the risen body of the Lord Christ. But of all
these, the most difficult question is, into whose body that flesh shall return which has been
eaten and assimilated by another man constrained by hunger to use it so; for it has been
converted into the flesh of the man who used it as his nutriment, and it filled up those losses
of flesh which famine had produced. For the sake, then, of ridiculing the resurrection, they
ask, Shall this return to the man whose flesh it first was, or to him whose flesh it afterwards
became? And thus, too, they seek to give promise to the human soul of alternations of true
misery and false happiness, in accordance with Plato’s theory; or, in accordance with Porphyry’s,
that, after many transmigrations into different bodies, it ends its miseries, and
never more returns to them, not, however, by obtaining an immortal body, but by escaping
from every kind of body.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Whether Abortions, If They are Numbered Among the Dead, Shall
Not Also Have a Part in the Resurrection.</head>
<p>To these objections, then, of our adversaries which I have thus detailed, I will now reply,
trusting that God will mercifully assist my endeavors. That abortions, which, even supposing
they were alive in the womb, did also die there, shall rise again, I make bold neither to affirm
nor to deny, although I fail to see why, if they are not excluded from the number of the dead,
they should not attain to the resurrection of the dead. For either all the dead shall not rise,
and there will be to all eternity some souls without bodies though they once had them,—only
in their mother’s womb, indeed; or, if all human souls shall receive again the bodies which
they had wherever they lived, and which they left when they died, then I do not see how I
can say that even those who died in their mother’s womb shall have no resurrection. But
whichever of these opinions any one may adopt concerning them, we must at least apply to
them, if they rise again, all that we have to say of infants who have been born.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Whether Infants Shall Rise in that Body Which They Would Have
Had Had They Grown Up.</head>
<p>What, then, are we to say of infants, if not that they will not rise in that diminutive body
in which they died, but shall receive by the marvellous and rapid operation of God that body
which time by a slower process would have given them? For in the Lord’s words, where He
495
says, “Not a hair of your head shall perish,”1631 it is asserted that nothing which was possessed
shall be wanting; but it is not said that nothing which was not possessed shall be
given. To the dead infant there was wanting the perfect stature of its body; for even the
perfect infant lacks the perfection of bodily size, being capable of further growth. This
perfect stature is, in a sense, so possessed by all that they are conceived and born with it,—that
is, they have it potentially, though not yet in actual bulk; just as all the members of the body
are potentially in the seed, though, even after the child is born, some of them, the teeth for
example, may be wanting. In this seminal principle of every substance, there seems to be,
as it were, the beginning of everything which does not yet exist, or rather does not appear,
but which in process of time will come into being, or rather into sight. In this, therefore,
the child who is to be tall or short is already tall or short. And in the resurrection of the
body, we need, for the same reason, fear no bodily loss; for though all should be of equal
size, and reach gigantic proportions, lest the men who were largest here should lose anything
of their bulk and it should perish, in contradiction to the words of Christ, who said that not
a hair of their head should perish, yet why should there lack the means by which that wonderful
Worker should make such additions, seeing that He is the Creator, who Himself
created all things out of nothing?</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Whether the Bodies of All the Dead Shall Rise the Same Size as the
Lord’s Body.</head>
<p>It is certain that Christ rose in the same bodily stature in which He died, and that it is
wrong to say that, when the general resurrection shall have arrived, His body shall, for the
sake of equalling the tallest, assume proportions which it had not when He appeared to the
disciples in the figure with which they were familiar. But if we say that even the bodies of
taller men are to be reduced to the size of the Lord’s body, there will be a great loss in many
bodies, though He promised that, not a hair of their head should perish. It remains, therefore,
that we conclude that every man shall receive his own size which he had in youth, though
he died an old man, or which he would have had, supposing he died before his prime. As
for what the apostle said of the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ, we must either
understand him to refer to something else, viz., to the fact that the measure of Christ will
be completed when all the members among the Christian communities are added to the
Head; or if we are to refer it to the resurrection of the body, the meaning is that all shall rise
neither beyond nor under youth, but in that vigor and age to which we know that Christ
had arrived. For even the world’s wisest men have fixed the bloom of youth at about the
age of thirty; and when this period has been passed, the man begins to decline towards the
defective and duller period of old age. And therefore the apostle did not speak of the
measure of the body, nor of the measure of the stature, but of “the measure of the age of the
fullness of Christ.”</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—What is Meant by the Conforming of the Saints to the Image of The
Son of God.</head>
<p>Then, again, these words, “Predestinate to be conformed to the image of the Son of
God,”1632 may be understood of the inner man. So in another place He says to us, “Be not
conformed to this world, but be ye transformed in the renewing of your mind.”1633 In so
far, then, as we are transformed so as not to be conformed to the world, we are conformed
to the Son of God. It may also be understood thus, that as He was conformed to us by assuming
mortality, we shall be conformed to Him by immortality; and this indeed is connected
with the resurrection of the body. But if we are also taught in these words what form our
bodies shall rise in, as the measure we spoke of before, so also this conformity is to be understood
not of size, but of age. Accordingly all shall rise in the stature they either had attained
or would have attained had they lived to their prime, although it will be no great
disadvantage even if the form of the body be infantine or aged, while no infirmity shall remain
in the mind nor in the body itself. So that even if any one contends that every person will
rise again in the same bodily form in which he died, we need not spend much labor in disputing
with him.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Whether the Bodies of Women Shall Retain Their Own Sex in the
Resurrection.</head>
<p>From the words, “Till we all come to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the
fullness of Christ,”1634 and from the words, “Conformed to the image of the Son of God,”1635
some conclude that women shall not rise women, but that all shall be men, because God
made man only of earth, and woman of the man. For my part, they seem to be wiser who
make no doubt that both sexes shall rise. For there shall be no lust, which is now the cause
of confusion. For before they sinned, the man and the woman were naked, and were not
ashamed. From those bodies, then, vice shall be withdrawn, while nature shall be preserved.
And the sex of woman is not a vice, but nature. It shall then indeed be superior to carnal
intercourse and child-bearing; nevertheless the female members shall remain adapted not
to the old uses, but to a new beauty, which, so far from provoking lust, now extinct, shall
excite praise to the wisdom and clemency of God, who both made what was not and delivered
from corruption what He made. For at the beginning of the human race the woman was
made of a rib taken from the side of the man while he slept; for it seemed fit that even then
Christ and His Church should be foreshadowed in this event. For that sleep of the man was
the death of Christ, whose side, as He hung lifeless upon the cross, was pierced with a spear,
and there flowed from it blood and water, and these we know to be the sacraments by which
the Church is “built up.” For Scripture used this very word, not saying “He formed” or
“framed,” but “built her up into a woman;”1636 whence also the apostle speaks of the edification
of the body of Christ,1637 which is the Church. The woman, therefore, is a creature
of God even as the man; but by her creation from man unity is commended; and the manner
of her creation prefigured, as has been said, Christ and the Church. He, then, who created
both sexes will restore both. Jesus Himself also, when asked by the Sadducees, who denied
the resurrection, which of the seven brothers should have to wife the woman whom all in
succession had taken to raise up seed to their brother, as the law enjoined, says, “Ye do err,
not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.”1638 And though it was a fit opportunity
for His saying, She about whom you make inquiries shall herself be a man, and not a woman,
He said nothing of the kind; but “In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.”1639 They shall be equal to the angels in
immortality and happiness, not in flesh, nor in resurrection, which the angels did not need,

because they could not die. The Lord then denied that there would be in the resurrection,
not women, but marriages; and He uttered this denial in circumstances in which the question
mooted would have been more easily and speedily solved by denying that the female sex
would exist, if this had in truth been foreknown by Him. But, indeed, He even affirmed
that the sex should exist by saying, “They shall not be given in marriage,” which can only
apply to females; “Neither shall they marry,” which applies to males. There shall therefore
be those who are in this world accustomed to marry and be given in marriage, only they
shall there make no such marriages.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—Of the Perfect Man, that Is, Christ; And of His Body, that Is, The
Church, Which is His Fullness.</head>
<p>To understand what the apostle means when he says that we shall all come to a perfect
man, we must consider the connection of the whole passage, which runs thus: “He that
descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all
things. And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,
pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of
the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ: that
we henceforth be no more children, tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine,
by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but,
speaking the truth in love, may grow up in Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ:
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint
supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase
of the body, unto the edifying of itself in love.”1640 Behold what the perfect man is—the
head and the body, which is made up of all the members, which in their own time shall be
perfected. But new additions are daily being made to this body while the Church is being
built up, to which it is said, “Ye are the body of Christ and His members;”1641 and again,
“For His body’s sake,” he says, “which is the Church;”1642 and again, “We being many are
one head, one body.”1643 It is of the edification of this body that it is here, too, said, “For
the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the body of
Christ;” and then that passage of which we are now speaking is added, “Till we all come to
the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of
the age of the fullness of Christ,” and so on. And he shows of what body we are to understand
this to be the measure, when he says, “That we may grow up into Him in all things, which
is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of
every part.” As, therefore, there is a measure of every part, so there is a measure of the
fullness of the whole body which is made up of all its parts, and it is of this measure it is
said, “To the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ.” This fullness he spoke of also in
the place where he says of Christ, “And gave Him to be the Head over all things to the

this should be referred to the form in which each one shall rise, what should hinder us from
applying to the woman what is expressly said of the man, understanding both sexes to be
included under the general term “man?” For certainly in the saying, “Blessed is he who

<head>Chapter 19.—That All Bodily Blemishes Which Mar Human Beauty in This Life
Shall Be Removed in the Resurrection, the Natural Substance of the Body Remaining,
But the Quality and Quantity of It Being Altered So as to Produce
Beauty.</head>
<p>What am I to say now about the hair and nails? Once it is understood that no part of
the body shall so perish as to produce deformity in the body, it is at the same time understood
that such things as would have produced a deformity by their excessive proportions shall
be added to the total bulk of the body, not to parts in which the beauty of the proportion
would thus be marred. Just as if, after making a vessel of clay, one wished to make it over
again of the same clay, it would not be necessary that the same portion of the clay which
had formed the handle should again form the new handle, or that what had formed the
bottom should again do so, but only that the whole clay should go to make up the whole
new vessel, and that no part of it should be left unused. Wherefore, if the hair that has been
cropped and the nails that have been cut would cause a deformity were they to be restored
to their places, they shall not be restored; and yet no one will lose these parts at the resurrection,
for they shall be changed into the same flesh, their substance being so altered as to
preserve the proportion of the various parts of the body. However, what our Lord said,
“Not a hair of your head shall perish,” might more suitably be interpreted of the number,
and not of the length of the hairs, as He elsewhere says, “The hairs of your head are all
numbered.”1647 Nor would I say this because I suppose that any part naturally belonging
to the body can perish, but that whatever deformity was in it, and served to exhibit the
penal condition in which we mortals are, should be restored in such a way that, while the
substance is entirely preserved, the deformity shall perish. For if even a human workman,
who has, for some reason, made a deformed statue, can recast it and make it very beautiful,
and this without suffering any part of the substance, but only the deformity to be lost,—if
he can, for example, remove some unbecoming or disproportionate part, not by cutting off
and separating this part from the whole, but by so breaking down and mixing up the whole
as to get rid of the blemish without diminishing the quantity of his material,—shall we not
think as highly of the almighty Worker? Shall He not be able to remove and abolish all deformities
of the human body, whether common ones or rare and monstrous, which, though
in keeping with this miserable life, are yet not to be thought of in connection with that future
blessedness; and shall He not be able so to remove them that, while the natural but unseemly
blemishes are put an end to, the natural substance shall suffer no diminution?</p>
<p>And consequently overgrown and emaciated persons need not fear that they shall be
in heaven of such a figure as they would not be even in this world if they could help it. For
all bodily beauty consists in the proportion of the parts, together with a certain agreeableness
<note type="footnote">1647 Luke xii. 7.</note>

<pb n="1126"/>
of color. Where there is no proportion, the eye is offended, either because there is something
awanting, or too small, or too large. And thus there shall be no deformity resulting from
want of proportion in that state in which all that is wrong is corrected, and all that is defective
supplied from resources the Creator wots of, and all that is excessive removed without destroying
the integrity of the substance. And as for the pleasant color, how conspicuous shall
it be where “the just shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father!”1648 This
brightness we must rather believe to have been concealed from the eyes of the disciples
when Christ rose, than to have been awanting. For weak human eyesight could not bear it,
and it was necessary that they should so look upon Him as to be able to recognize Him. For
this purpose also He allowed them to touch the marks of His wounds, and also ate and
drank,—not because He needed nourishment, but because He could take it if He wished.
Now, when an object, though present, is invisible to persons who see other things which
are present, as we say that that brightness was present but invisible by those who saw other
things, this is called in Greek ἀορασία; and our Latin translators, for want of a better word,
have rendered this cæcitas (blindness) in the book of Genesis. This blindness the men of
Sodom suffered when they sought the just Lot’s gate and could not find it. But if it had been
blindness, that is to say, if they could see nothing, then they would not have asked for the
gate by which they might enter the house, but for guides who might lead them away.</p>
<p>But the love we bear to the blessed martyrs causes us, I know not how, to desire to see
in the heavenly kingdom the marks of the wounds which they received for the name of
Christ, and possibly we shall see them. For this will not be a deformity, but a mark of honor,
and will add lustre to their appearance, and a spiritual, if not a bodily beauty. And yet we
need not believe that they to whom it has been said, “Not a hair of your head shall perish,”
shall, in the resurrection, want such of their members as they have been deprived of in their
martyrdom. But if it will be seemly in that new kingdom to have some marks of these
wounds still visible in that immortal flesh, the places where they have been wounded or
mutilated shall retain the scars without any of the members being lost. While, therefore, it
is quite true that no blemishes which the body has sustained shall appear in the resurrection,
yet we are not to reckon or name these marks of virtue blemishes.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—That, in the Resurrection, the Substance of Our Bodies, However
Disintegrated, Shall Be Entirely Reunited.</head>
<p>Far be it from us to fear that the omnipotence of the Creator cannot, for the resuscitation
and reanimation of our bodies, recall all the portions which have been consumed by beasts
or fire, or have been dissolved into dust or ashes, or have decomposed into water, or evaporated
into the air. Far from us be the thought, that anything which escapes our observation
in any most hidden recess of nature either evades the knowledge or transcends the power
of the Creator of all things. Cicero, the great authority of our adversaries, wishing to define
God as accurately as possible, says, “God is a mind free and independent, without materiality,
perceiving and moving all things, and itself endowed with eternal movement.”1649 This he
found in the systems of the greatest philosophers. Let me ask, then, in their own language,
how anything can either lie hid from Him who perceives all things, or irrevocably escape
Him who moves all things?</p>
<p>This leads me to reply to that question which seems the most difficult of all,—To whom,
in the resurrection, will belong the flesh of a dead man which has become the flesh of a living
man? For if some one, famishing for want and pressed with hunger, use human flesh as
food,—an extremity not unknown, as both ancient history and the unhappy experience of
our own days have taught us,—can it be contended, with any show of reason, that all the
flesh eaten has been evacuated, and that none of it has been assimilated to the substance of
the eater though the very emaciation which existed before, and has now disappeared, sufficiently
indicates what large deficiencies have been filled up with this food? But I have already
made some remarks which will suffice for the solution of this difficulty also. For all the flesh
which hunger has consumed finds its way into the air by evaporation, whence, as we have
said, God Almighty can recall it. That flesh, therefore, shall be restored to the man in whom
it first became human flesh. For it must be looked upon as borrowed by the other person,
and, like a pecuniary loan, must be returned to the lender. His own flesh, however, which
he lost by famine, shall be restored to him by Him who can recover even what has evaporated.
And though it had been absolutely annihilated, so that no part of its substance remained in
any secret spot of nature, the Almighty could restore it by such means as He saw fit. For
this sentence, uttered by the Truth, “Not a hair of your head shall perish,” forbids us to
suppose that, though no hair of a man’s head can perish, yet the large portions of his flesh
eaten and consumed by the famishing can perish.</p>
<note type="footnote">1649 Cic. Tusc. Quæst. i. 27.</note>

<pb n="1128"/>
<p>From all that we have thus considered, and discussed with such poor ability as we can
command, we gather this conclusion, that in the resurrection of the flesh the body shall be
of that size which it either had attained or should have attained in the flower of its youth,
and shall enjoy the beauty that arises from preserving symmetry and proportion in all its
members. And it is reasonable to suppose that, for the preservation of this beauty, any part
of the body’s substance, which, if placed in one spot, would produce a deformity, shall be
distributed through the whole of it, so that neither any part, nor the symmetry of the whole,
may be lost, but only the general stature of the body somewhat increased by the distribution
in all the parts of that which, in one place, would have been unsightly. Or if it is contended
that each will rise with the same stature as that of the body he died in, we shall not obstinately
dispute this, provided only there be no deformity, no infirmity, no languor, no corruption,—
nothing of any kind which would ill become that kingdom in which the children of
the resurrection and of the promise shall be equal to the angels of God, if not in body and
age, at least in happiness.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Of the New Spiritual Body into Which the Flesh of the Saints Shall Be
Transformed.</head>
<p>Whatever, therefore, has been taken from the body, either during life or after death shall
be restored to it, and, in conjunction with what has remained in the grave, shall rise again,
transformed from the oldness of the animal body into the newness of the spiritual body,
and clothed in incorruption and immortality. But even though the body has been all quite
ground to powder by some severe accident, or by the ruthlessness of enemies, and though
it has been so diligently scattered to the winds, or into the water, that there is no trace of it
left, yet it shall not be beyond the omnipotence of the Creator,—no, not a hair of its head
shall perish. The flesh shall then be spiritual, and subject to the spirit, but still flesh, not
spirit, as the spirit itself, when subject to the flesh, was fleshly, but still spirit and not flesh.
And of this we have experimental proof in the deformity of our penal condition. For those
persons were carnal, not in a fleshly, but in a spiritual way, to whom the apostle said, “I
could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.”1650 And a man is in this life
spiritual in such a way, that he is yet carnal with respect to his body, and sees another law
in his members warring against the law of his mind; but even in his body he will be spiritual
when the same flesh shall have had that resurrection of which these words speak, “It is sown
an animal body, it shall rise a spiritual body.”1651 But what this spiritual body shall be and
how great its grace, I fear it were but rash to pronounce, seeing that we have as yet no experience
of it. Nevertheless, since it is fit that the joyfulness of our hope should utter itself, and
so show forth God’s praise, and since it was from the profoundest sentiment of ardent and
holy love that the Psalmist cried, “O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house,”1652 we
may, with God’s help, speak of the gifts He lavishes on men, good and bad alike, in this most
wretched life, and may do our best to conjecture the great glory of that state which we cannot
worthily speak of, because we have not yet experienced it. For I say nothing of the time
when God made man upright; I say nothing of the happy life of “the man and his wife” in
the fruitful garden, since it was so short that none of their children experienced it: I speak
only of this life which we know, and in which we now are, from the temptations of which
we cannot escape so long as we are in it, no matter what progress we make, for it is all
temptation, and I ask, Who can describe the tokens of God’s goodness that are extended to
the human race even in this life?</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—Of the Miseries and Ills to Which the Human Race is Justly Exposed
Through the First Sin, and from Which None Can Be Delivered Save by Christ’s
Grace.</head>
<p>That the whole human race has been condemned in its first origin, this life itself, if life
it is to be called, bears witness by the host of cruel ills with which it is filled. Is not this
proved by the profound and dreadful ignorance which produces all the errors that enfold
the children of Adam, and from which no man can be delivered without toil, pain, and fear?
Is it not proved by his love of so many vain and hurtful things, which produces gnawing
cares, disquiet, griefs, fears, wild joys, quarrels, lawsuits, wars, treasons, angers, hatreds,
deceit, flattery, fraud, theft, robbery, perfidy, pride, ambition, envy, murders, parricides,
cruelty, ferocity, wickedness, luxury, insolence, impudence, shamelessness, fornications,
adulteries, incests, and the numberless uncleannesses and unnatural acts of both sexes,
which it is shameful so much as to mention; sacrileges, heresies, blasphemies, perjuries,
oppression of the innocent, calumnies, plots, falsehoods, false witnessings, unrighteous
judgments, violent deeds, plunderings, and whatever similar wickedness has found its way
into the lives of men, though it cannot find its way into the conception of pure minds?
These are indeed the crimes of wicked men, yet they spring from that root of error and
misplaced love which is born with every son of Adam. For who is there that has not observed
with what profound ignorance, manifesting itself even in infancy, and with what superfluity
of foolish desires, beginning to appear in boyhood, man comes into this life, so that, were
he left to live as he pleased, and to do whatever he pleased, he would plunge into all, or
certainly into many of those crimes and iniquities which I mentioned, and could not mention?</p>
<p>But because God does not wholly desert those whom He condemns, nor shuts up in
His anger His tender mercies, the human race is restrained by law and instruction, which
keep guard against the ignorance that besets us, and oppose the assaults of vice, but are
themselves full of labor and sorrow. For what mean those multifarious threats which are
used to restrain the folly of children? What mean pedagogues, masters, the birch, the strap,
the cane, the schooling which Scripture says must be given a child, “beating him on the sides
lest he wax stubborn,”1653 and it be hardly possible or not possible at all to subdue him?
Why all these punishments, save to overcome ignorance and bridle evil desires—these evils
with which we come into the world? For why is it that we remember with difficulty, and
without difficulty forget? learn with difficulty, and without difficulty remain ignorant? are
diligent with difficulty, and without difficulty are indolent? Does not this show what vitiated
nature inclines and tends to by its own weight, and what succor it needs if it is to be delivered?
Inactivity, sloth, laziness, negligence, are vices which shun labor, since labor, though
useful, is itself a punishment.</p>
<note type="footnote">1653 Ecclus. xxx. 12.</note>

<pb n="1131"/>
<p>But, besides the punishments of childhood, without which there would be no learning
of what the parents wish,—and the parents rarely wish anything useful to be taught,—who
can describe, who can conceive the number and severity of the punishments which afflict
the human race,—pains which are not only the accompaniment of the wickedness of godless
men, but are a part of the human condition and the common misery,—what fear and what
grief are caused by bereavement and mourning, by losses and condemnations, by fraud and
falsehood, by false suspicions, and all the crimes and wicked deeds of other men? For at
their hands we suffer robbery, captivity, chains, imprisonment, exile, torture, mutilation,
loss of sight, the violation of chastity to satisfy the lust of the oppressor, and many other
dreadful evils. What numberless casualties threaten our bodies from without,—extremes
of heat and cold, storms, floods, inundations, lightning, thunder, hail, earthquakes, houses
falling; or from the stumbling, or shying, or vice of horses; from countless poisons in fruits,
water, air, animals; from the painful or even deadly bites of wild animals; from the madness
which a mad dog communicates, so that even the animal which of all others is most gentle
and friendly to its own master, becomes an object of intenser fear than a lion or dragon,
and the man whom it has by chance infected with this pestilential contagion becomes so
rabid, that his parents, wife, children, dread him more than any wild beast! What disasters
are suffered by those who travel by land or sea! What man can go out of his own house
without being exposed on all hands to unforeseen accidents? Returning home sound in
limb, he slips on his own doorstep, breaks his leg, and never recovers. What can seem safer
than a man sitting in his chair? Eli the priest fell from his, and broke his neck. How many
accidents do farmers, or rather all men, fear that the crops may suffer from the weather, or
the soil, or the ravages of destructive animals? Commonly they feel safe when the crops are
gathered and housed. Yet, to my certain knowledge, sudden floods have driven the laborers
away, and swept the barns clean of the finest harvest. Is innocence a sufficient protection
against the various assaults of demons? That no man might think so, even baptized infants,
who are certainly unsurpassed in innocence, are sometimes so tormented, that God, who
permits it, teaches us hereby to bewail the calamities of this life, and to desire the felicity of
the life to come. As to bodily diseases, they are so numerous that they cannot all be contained
even in medical books. And in very many, or almost all of them, the cures and remedies
are themselves tortures, so that men are delivered from a pain that destroys by a cure that
pains. Has not the madness of thirst driven men to drink human urine, and even their own?
Has not hunger driven men to eat human flesh, and that the flesh not of bodies found dead,
but of bodies slain for the purpose? Have not the fierce pangs of famine driven mothers to
eat their own children, incredibly savage as it seems? In fine, sleep itself, which is justly
called repose, how little of repose there sometimes is in it when disturbed with dreams and

<pb n="1132"/>
visions; and with what terror is the wretched mind overwhelmed by the appearances of
things which are so presented, and which, as it were so stand out before the senses, that we
can not distinguish them from realities! How wretchedly do false appearances distract men
in certain diseases! With what astonishing variety of appearances are even healthy men
sometimes deceived by evil spirits, who produce these delusions for the sake of perplexing
the senses of their victims, if they cannot succeed in seducing them to their side!</p>
<p>From this hell upon earth there is no escape, save through the grace of the Saviour
Christ, our God and Lord. The very name Jesus shows this, for it means Saviour; and He
saves us especially from passing out of this life into a more wretched and eternal state, which
is rather a death than a life. For in this life, though holy men and holy pursuits afford us
great consolations, yet the blessings which men crave are not invariably bestowed upon
them, lest religion should be cultivated for the sake of these temporal advantages, while it
ought rather to be cultivated for the sake of that other life from which all evil is excluded.
Therefore, also, does grace aid good men in the midst of present calamities, so that they are
enabled to endure them with a constancy proportioned to their faith. The world’s sages affirm
that philosophy contributes something to this,—that philosophy which, according to Cicero,
the gods have bestowed in its purity only on a few men. They have never given, he says,
nor can ever give, a greater gift to men. So that even those against whom we are disputing
have been compelled to acknowledge, in some fashion, that the grace of God is necessary
for the acquisition, not, indeed, of any philosophy, but of the true philosophy. And if the
true philosophy—this sole support against the miseries of this life—has been given by
Heaven only to a few, it sufficiently appears from this that the human race has been condemned
to pay this penalty of wretchedness. And as, according to their acknowledgment,
no greater gift has been bestowed by God, so it must be believed that it could be given only
by that God whom they themselves recognize as greater than all the gods they worship.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Of the Miseries of This Life Which Attach Peculiarly to the Toil of
Good Men, Irrespective of Those Which are Common to the Good and Bad.</head>
<p>But, irrespective of the miseries which in this life are common to the good and bad, the
righteous undergo labors peculiar to themselves, in so far as they make war upon their vices,
and are involved in the temptations and perils of such a contest. For though sometimes
more violent and at other times slacker, yet without intermission does the flesh lust against
the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, so that we cannot do the things we would,1654 and
extirpate all lust, but can only refuse consent to it, as God gives us ability, and so keep it
under, vigilantly keeping watch lest a semblance of truth deceive us, lest a subtle discourse
blind us, lest error involve us in darkness, lest we should take good for evil or evil for good,
lest fear should hinder us from doing what we ought, or desire precipitate us into doing
what we ought not, lest the sun go down upon our wrath, lest hatred provoke us to render
evil for evil, lest unseemly or immoderate grief consume us, lest an ungrateful disposition
make us slow to recognize benefits received, lest calumnies fret our conscience, lest rash
suspicion on our part deceive us regarding a friend, or false suspicion of us on the part of
others give us too much uneasiness, lest sin reign in our mortal body to obey its desires, lest
our members be used as the instruments of unrighteousness, lest the eye follow lust, lest
thirst for revenge carry us away, lest sight or thought dwell too long on some evil thing
which gives us pleasure, lest wicked or indecent language be willingly listened to, lest we do
what is pleasant but unlawful, and lest in this warfare, filled so abundantly with toil and
peril, we either hope to secure victory by our own strength, or attribute it when secured to
our own strength, and not to His grace of whom the apostle says, “Thanks be unto God,
who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ;”1655 and in another place he says,
“In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.”1656 But yet
we are to know this, that however valorously we resist our vices, and however successful we
are in overcoming them, yet as long as we are in this body we have always reason to say to
God, Forgive us our debts.”1657 But in that kingdom where we shall dwell for ever, clothed
in immortal bodies, we shall no longer have either conflicts or debts,—as indeed we should
not have had at any time or in any condition, had our nature continued upright as it was
created. Consequently even this our conflict, in which we are exposed to peril, and from
which we hope to be delivered by a final victory, belongs to the ills of this life, which is
proved by the witness of so many grave evils to be a life under condemnation.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—Of the Blessings with Which the Creator Has Filled This Life, Obnoxious
Though It Be to the Curse.</head>
<p>But we must now contemplate the rich and countless blessings with which the goodness
of God, who cares for all He has created, has filled this very misery of the human race, which
reflects His retributive justice. That first blessing which He pronounced before the fall,
when He said, “Increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth,”1658 He did not inhibit
after man had sinned, but the fecundity originally bestowed remained in the condemned
stock; and the vice of sin, which has involved us in the necessity of dying, has yet not deprived
us of that wonderful power of seed, or rather of that still more marvellous power by which
seed is produced, and which seems to be as it were inwrought and inwoven in the human
body. But in this river, as I may call it, or torrent of the human race, both elements are
carried along together,—both the evil which is derived from him who begets, and the good
which is bestowed by Him who creates us. In the original evil there are two things, sin and
punishment; in the original good, there are two other things, propagation and conformation.
But of the evils, of which the one, sin, arose from our audacity, and the other, punishment,
from God’s judgment, we have already said as much as suits our present purpose. I mean
now to speak of the blessings which God has conferred or still confers upon our nature,
vitiated and condemned as it is. For in condemning it He did not withdraw all that He had
given it, else it had been annihilated; neither did He, in penally subjecting it to the devil,
remove it beyond His own power; for not even the devil himself is outside of God’s government,
since the devil’s nature subsists only by the supreme Creator who gives being to all
that in any form exists.</p>
<p>Of these two blessings, then, which we have said flow from God’s goodness, as from a
fountain, towards our nature, vitiated by sin and condemned to punishment, the one,
propagation, was conferred by God’s benediction when He made those first works, from
which He rested on the seventh day. But the other, conformation, is conferred in that work
of His wherein “He worketh hitherto.”1659 For were He to withdraw His efficacious power
from things, they should neither be able to go on and complete the periods assigned to their
measured movements, nor should they even continue in possession of that nature they were
created in. God, then, so created man that He gave him what we may call fertility, whereby
he might propagate other men, giving them a congenital capacity to propagate their kind,
but not imposing on them any necessity to do so. This capacity God withdraws at pleasure
from individuals, making them barren; but from the whole race He has not withdrawn the
blessing of propagation once conferred. But though not withdrawn on account of sin, this
power of propagation is not what it would have been had there been no sin. For since “man
<note type="footnote">1658 Gen. i. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">1659 John v. 17.</note>

<pb n="1135"/>
placed in honor fell, he has become like the beasts,”1660 and generates as they do, though
the little spark of reason, which was the image of God in him, has not been quite quenched.
But if conformation were not added to propagation, there would be no reproduction of
one’s kind. For even though there were no such thing as copulation, and God wished to fill
the earth with human inhabitants, He might create all these as He created one without the
help of human generation. And, indeed, even as it is, those who copulate can generate
nothing save by the creative energy of God. As, therefore, in respect of that spiritual growth
whereby a man is formed to piety and righteousness, the apostle says, “Neither is he that
planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase,”1661 so also
it must be said that it is not he that generates that is anything, but God that giveth the essential
form; that it is not the mother who carries and nurses the fruit of her womb that is anything,
but God that giveth the increase. For He alone, by that energy wherewith “He worketh
hitherto,” causes the seed to develop, and to evolve from certain secret and invisible folds
into the visible forms of beauty which we see. He alone, coupling and connecting in some
wonderful fashion the spiritual and corporeal natures, the one to command, the other to
obey, makes a living being. And this work of His is so great and wonderful, that not only
man, who is a rational animal, and consequently more excellent than all other animals of
the earth, but even the most diminutive insect, cannot be considered attentively without
astonishment and without praising the Creator.</p>
<p>It is He, then, who has given to the human soul a mind, in which reason and understanding
lie as it were asleep during infancy, and as if they were not, destined, however, to be
awakened and exercised as years increase, so as to become capable of knowledge and of receiving
instruction, fit to understand what is true and to love what is good. It is by this ca-
pacity the soul drinks in wisdom, and becomes endowed with those virtues by which, in
prudence, fortitude, temperance, and righteousness, it makes war upon error and the other
inborn vices, and conquers them by fixing its desires upon no other object than the supreme
and unchangeable Good. And even though this be not uniformly the result, yet who can
competently utter or even conceive the grandeur of this work of the Almighty, and the unspeakable
boon He has conferred upon our rational nature, by giving us even the capacity
of such attainment? For over and above those arts which are called virtues, and which teach
us how we may spend our life well, and attain to endless happiness,—arts which are given
to the children of the promise and the kingdom by the sole grace of God which is in
Christ,—has not the genius of man invented and applied countless astonishing arts, partly
the result of necessity, partly the result of exuberant invention, so that this vigor of mind,
which is so active in the discovery not merely of superfluous but even of dangerous and
<note type="footnote">1660 Ps. xlix. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">1661 1 Cor. iii. 7.</note>

<pb n="1136"/>
destructive things, betokens an inexhaustible wealth in the nature which can invent, learn,
or employ such arts? What wonderful—one might say stupefying—advances has human
industry made in the arts of weaving and building, of agriculture and navigation! With
what endless variety are designs in pottery, painting, and sculpture produced, and with what
skill executed! What wonderful spectacles are exhibited in the theatres, which those who
have not seen them cannot credit! How skillful the contrivances for catching, killing, or
taming wild beasts! And for the injury of men, also, how many kinds of poisons, weapons,
engines of destruction, have been invented, while for the preservation or restoration of
health the appliances and remedies are infinite! To provoke appetite and please the palate,
what a variety of seasonings have been concocted! To express and gain entrance for thoughts,
what a multitude and variety of signs there are, among which speaking and writing hold
the first place! what ornaments has eloquence at command to delight the mind! what wealth
of song is there to captivate the ear! how many musical instruments and strains of harmony
have been devised! What skill has been attained in measures and numbers! with what
sagacity have the movements and connections of the stars been discovered! Who could tell
the thought that has been spent upon nature, even though, despairing of recounting it in
detail, he endeavored only to give a general view of it? In fine, even the defence of errors
and misapprehensions, which has illustrated the genius of heretics and philosophers, cannot
be sufficiently declared. For at present it is the nature of the human mind which adorns
this mortal life which we are extolling, and not the faith and the way of truth which lead to
immortality. And since this great nature has certainly been created by the true and supreme
God, who administers all things He has made with absolute power and justice, it could
never have fallen into these miseries, nor have gone out of them to miseries eternal, —saving
only those who are redeemed,—had not an exceeding great sin been found in the first man
from whom the rest have sprung.</p>
<p>Moreover, even in the body, though it dies like that of the beasts, and is in many ways
weaker than theirs, what goodness of God, what providence of the great Creator, is apparent!
The organs of sense and the rest of the members, are not they so placed, the appearance,
and form, and stature of the body as a whole, is it not so fashioned, as to indicate that it was
made for the service of a reasonable soul? Man has not been created stooping towards the
earth, like the irrational animals; but his bodily form, erect and looking heavenwards, admonishes
him to mind the things that are above. Then the marvellous nimbleness which
has been given to the tongue and the hands, fitting them to speak, and write, and execute
so many duties, and practise so many arts, does it not prove the excellence of the soul for
which such an assistant was provided? And even apart from its adaptation to the work required
of it, there is such a symmetry in its various parts, and so beautiful a proportion
maintained, that one is at a loss to decide whether, in creating the body, greater regard was
paid to utility or to beauty. Assuredly no part of the body has been created for the sake of

<pb n="1137"/>
utility which does not also contribute something to its beauty. And this would be all the
more apparent, if we knew more precisely how all its parts are connected and adapted to
one another, and were not limited in our observations to what appears on the surface; for
as to what is covered up and hidden from our view, the intricate web of veins and nerves,
the vital parts of all that lies under the skin, no one can discover it. For although, with a
cruel zeal for science, some medical men, who are called anatomists, have dissected the
bodies of the dead, and sometimes even of sick persons who died under their knives, and
have inhumanly pried into the secrets of the human body to learn the nature of the disease
and its exact seat, and how it might be cured, yet those relations of which I speak, and which
form the concord,1662 or, as the Greeks call it, “harmony,” of the whole body outside and
in, as of some instrument, no one has been able to discover, because no one has been audacious
enough to seek for them. But if these could be known, then even the inward parts,
which seem to have no beauty, would so delight us with their exquisite fitness, as to afford
a profounder satisfaction to the mind—and the eyes are but its ministers—than the obvious
beauty which gratifies the eye. There are some things, too, which have such a place in the
body, that they obviously serve no useful purpose, but are solely for beauty, as e.g. the teats
on a man’s breast, or the beard on his face; for that this is for ornament, and not for protection,
is proved by the bare faces of women, who ought rather, as the weaker sex, to enjoy
such a defence. If, therefore, of all those members which are exposed to our view, there is
certainly not one in which beauty is sacrificed to utility, while there are some which serve
no purpose but only beauty, I think it can readily be concluded that in the creation of the
human body comeliness was more regarded than necessity. In truth, necessity is a transitory
thing; and the time is coming when we shall enjoy one another’s beauty without any lust,—a
condition which will specially redound to the praise of the Creator, who, as it is said in the
psalm, has “put on praise and comeliness.”1663</p>
<p>How can I tell of the rest of creation, with all its beauty and utility, which the divine
goodness has given to man to please his eye and serve his purposes, condemned though he
is, and hurled into these labors and miseries? Shall I speak of the manifold and various
loveliness of sky, and earth, and sea; of the plentiful supply and wonderful qualities of the
light; of sun, moon, and stars; of the shade of trees; of the colors and perfume of flowers; of
the multitude of birds, all differing in plumage and in song; of the variety of animals, of
which the smallest in size are often the most wonderful,—the works of ants and bees astonishing
us more than the huge bodies of whales? Shall I speak of the sea, which itself is so
grand a spectacle, when it arrays itself as it were in vestures of various colors, now running
through every shade of green, and again becoming purple or blue? Is it not delightful to

look at it in storm, and experience the soothing complacency which it inspires, by suggesting
that we ourselves are not tossed and shipwrecked?1664 What shall I say of the numberless
kinds of food to alleviate hunger, and the variety of seasonings to stimulate appetite which
are scattered everywhere by nature, and for which we are not indebted to the art of cookery?
How many natural appliances are there for preserving and restoring health! How grateful
is the alternation of day and night! how pleasant the breezes that cool the air! how abundant
the supply of clothing furnished us by trees and animals! Who can enumerate all the
blessings we enjoy? If I were to attempt to detail and unfold only these few which I have
indicated in the mass, such an enumeration would fill a volume. And all these are but the
solace of the wretched and condemned, not the rewards of the blessed. What then shall
these rewards be, if such be the blessings of a condemned state? What will He give to those
whom He has predestined to life, who has given such things even to those whom He has
predestined to death? What blessings will He in the blessed life shower upon those for
whom, even in this state of misery, He has been willing that His only-begotten Son should
endure such sufferings even to death? Thus the apostle reasons concerning those who are
predestined to that kingdom: “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for
us all, how shall He not with Him also give us all things?”1665 When this promise is fulfilled,
what shall we be? What blessings shall we receive in that kingdom, since already we have
received as the pledge of them Christ’s dying? In what condition shall the spirit of man be,
when it has no longer any vice at all; when it neither yields to any, nor is in bondage to any,
nor has to make war against any, but is perfected, and enjoys undisturbed peace with itself?
Shall it not then know all things with certainty, and without any labor or error, when unhindered
and joyfully it drinks the wisdom of God at the fountain-head? What shall the
body be, when it is in every respect subject to the spirit, from which it shall draw a life so
sufficient, as to stand in need of no other nutriment? For it shall no longer be animal, but
spiritual, having indeed the substance of flesh, but without any fleshly corruption.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Of the Obstinacy of Those Individuals Who Impugn the Resurrection
of the Body, Though, as Was Predicted, the Whole World Believes It.</head>
<p>The foremost of the philosophers agree with us about the spiritual felicity enjoyed by
the blessed in the life to come; it is only the resurrection of the flesh they call in question,
and with all their might deny. But the mass of men, learned and unlearned, the world’s wise
men and its fools, have believed, and have left in meagre isolation the unbelievers, and have
turned to Christ, who in His own resurrection demonstrated the reality of that which seems
to our adversaries absurd. For the world has believed this which God predicted, as it was
also predicted that the world would believe,—a prediction not due to the sorceries of
Peter,1666 since it was uttered so long before. He who has predicted these things, as I have
already said, and am not ashamed to repeat, is the God before whom all other divinities
tremble, as Porphyry himself owns, and seeks to prove, by testimonies from the oracles of
these gods, and goes so far as to call Him God the Father and King. Far be it from us to interpret
these predictions as they do who have not believed, along with the whole world, in
that which it was predicted the world would believe in. For why should we not rather understand
them as the world does, whose belief was predicted, and leave that handful of unbelievers
to their idle talk and obstinate and solitary infidelity? For if they maintain that
they interpret them differently only to avoid charging Scripture with folly, and so doing an
injury to that God to whom they bear so notable a testimony, is it not a much greater injury
they do Him when they say that His predictions must be understood otherwise than the
world believed them, though He Himself praised, promised, accomplished this belief on the
world’s part? And why cannot He cause the body to rise again, and live for ever? or is it not
to be believed that He will do this, because it is an undesirable thing, and unworthy of God?
Of His omnipotence, which effects so many great miracles, we have already said enough.
If they wish to know what the Almighty cannot do, I shall tell them He cannot lie. Let us
therefore believe what He can do, by refusing to believe what He cannot do. Refusing to
believe that He can lie, let them believe that He will do what He has promised to do; and let
them believe it as the world has believed it, whose faith He predicted, whose faith He praised,
whose faith He promised, whose faith He now points to. But how do they prove that the
resurrection is an undesirable thing? There shall then be no corruption, which is the only
evil thing about the body. I have already said enough about the order of the elements, and
the other fanciful objections men raise; and in the thirteenth book I have, in my own judgment,
sufficiently illustrated the facility of movement which the incorruptible body shall
enjoy, judging from the ease and vigor we experience even now, when the body is in good
health. Those who have either not read the former books, or wish to refresh their memory,
may read them for themselves.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—That the Opinion of Porphyry, that the Soul, in Order to Be Blessed,
Must Be Separated from Every Kind of Body, is Demolished by Plato, Who Says
that the Supreme God Promised the Gods that They Should Never Be Ousted
from Their Bodies.</head>
<p>But, say they, Porphyry tells us that the soul, in order to be blessed, must escape connection
with every kind of body. It does not avail, therefore, to say that the future body shall
be incorruptible, if the soul cannot be blessed till delivered from every kind of body. But
in the book above mentioned I have already sufficiently discussed this. This one thing only
will I repeat,—let Plato, their master, correct his writings, and say that their gods, in order
to be blessed, must quit their bodies, or, in other words, die; for he said that they were shut
up in celestial bodies, and that, nevertheless, the God who made them promised them immortality,—
that is to say, an eternal tenure of these same bodies, such as was not provided
for them naturally, but only by the further intervention of His will, that thus they might be
assured of felicity. In this he obviously overturns their assertion that the resurrection of the
body cannot be believed because it is impossible; for, according to him, when the uncreated
God promised immortality to the created gods, He expressly said that He would do what
was impossible. For Plato tells us that He said, “As ye have had a beginning, so you cannot
be immortal and incorruptible; yet ye shall not decay, nor shall any fate destroy you or prove
stronger than my will, which more effectually binds you to immortality than the bond of
your nature keeps you from it.” If they who hear these words have, we do not say understanding,
but ears, they cannot doubt that Plato believed that God promised to the gods He
had made that He would effect an impossibility. For He who says, “Ye cannot be immortal,
but by my will ye shall be immortal,” what else does He say than this, “I shall make you what
ye cannot be?” The body, therefore, shall be raised incorruptible, immortal, spiritual, by
Him who, according to Plato, has promised to do that which is impossible. Why then do
they still exclaim that this which God has promised, which the world has believed on God’s
promise as was predicted, is an impossibility? For what we say is, that the God who, even
according to Plato, does impossible things, will do this. It is not, then, necessary to the
blessedness of the soul that it be detached from a body of any kind whatever, but that it receive
an incorruptible body. And in what incorruptible body will they more suitably rejoice than
in that in which they groaned when it was corruptible? For thus they shall not feel that dire
craving which Virgil, in imitation of Plato, has ascribed to them when he says that they wish
to return again to their bodies.1667 They shall not, I say, feel this desire to return to their
bodies, since they shall have those bodies to which a return was desired, and shall, indeed,
be in such thorough possession of them, that they shall never lose them even for the briefest
moment, nor ever lay them down in death.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—Of the Apparently Conflicting Opinions of Plato and Porphyry, Which
Would Have Conducted Them Both to the Truth If They Could Have Yielded
to One Another.</head>
<p>Statements were made by Plato and Porphyry singly, which if they could have seen their
way to hold in common, they might possibly have became Christians. Plato said that souls
could not exist eternally without bodies; for it was on this account, he said, that the souls
even of wise men must some time or other return to their bodies. Porphyry, again, said that
the purified soul, when it has returned to the Father, shall never return to the ills of this
world. Consequently, if Plato had communicated to Porphyry that which he saw to be true,
that souls, though perfectly purified, and belonging to the wise and righteous, must return
to human bodies; and if Porphyry, again, had imparted to Plato the truth which he saw, that
holy soul, shall never return to the miseries of a corruptible body, so that they should not
have each held only his own opinion, but should both have held both truths, I think they
would have seen that it follows that the souls return to their bodies, and also that these
bodies shall be such as to afford them a blessed and immortal life. For, according to Plato,
even holy souls shall return to the body; according to Porphyry, holy souls shall not return
to the ills of this world. Let Porphyry then say with Plato, they shall return to the body; let
Plato say with Porphyry, they shall not return to their old misery: and they will agree that
they return to bodies in which they shall suffer no more. And this is nothing else than what
God has promised,—that He will give eternal felicity to souls joined to their own bodies.
For this, I presume, both of them would readily concede, that if the souls of the saints are
to be reunited to bodies, it shall be to their own bodies, in which they have endured the
miseries of this life, and in which, to escape these miseries, they served God with piety and
fidelity.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—What Plato or Labeo, or Even Varro, Might Have Contributed to the
True Faith of the Resurrection, If They Had Adopted One Another’s Opinions
into One Scheme.</head>
<p>Some Christians, who have a liking for Plato on account of his magnificent style and
the truths which he now and then uttered, say that he even held an opinion similar to our
own regarding the resurrection of the dead. Cicero, however, alluding to this in his Republic,
asserts that Plato meant it rather as a playful fancy than as a reality; for he introduces a
man1668 who had come to life again, and gave a narrative of his experience in corroboration
of the doctrines of Plato. Labeo, too, says that two men died on one day, and met at a crossroad,
and that, being afterwards ordered to return to their bodies, they agreed to be friends
for life, and were so till they died again. But the resurrection which these writers instance
resembles that of those persons whom we have ourselves known to rise again, and who came
back indeed to this life, but not so as never to die again. Marcus Varro, however, in his
work On the Origin of the Roman People, records something more remarkable; I think his
own words should be given. “Certain astrologers,” he says, “have written that men are
destined to a new birth, which the Greeks call palingenesy. This will take place after four
hundred and forty years have elapsed; and then the same soul and the same body, which
were formerly united in the person, shall again be reunited.” This Varro, indeed, or those
nameless astrologers,—for he does not give us the names of the men whose statement he
cites,—have affirmed what is indeed not altogether true; for once the souls have returned
to the bodies they wore, they shall never afterwards leave them. Yet what they say upsets
and demolishes much of that idle talk of our adversaries about the impossibility of the re-
surrection. For those who have been or are of this opinion, have not thought it possible
that bodies which have dissolved into air, or dust, or ashes, or water, or into the bodies of
the beasts or even of the men that fed on them, should be restored again to that which they
formerly were. And therefore, if Plato and Porphyry, or rather, if their disciples now living,
agree with us that holy souls shall return to the body, as Plato says, and that, nevertheless,
they shall not return to misery, as Porphyry maintains, —if they accept the consequence of
these two propositions which is taught by the Christian faith, that they shall receive bodies
in which they may live eternally without suffering any misery,—let them also adopt from
Varro the opinion that they shall return to the same bodies as they were formerly in, and
thus the whole question of the eternal resurrection of the body shall be resolved out of their
own mouths.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—Of the Beatific Vision.</head>
<p>And now let us consider, with such ability as God may vouchsafe, how the saints shall
be employed when they are clothed in immortal and spiritual bodies, and when the flesh
shall live no longer in a fleshly but a spiritual fashion. And indeed, to tell the truth, I am at
a loss to understand the nature of that employment, or, shall I rather say, repose and ease,
for it has never come within the range of my bodily senses. And if I should speak of my
mind or understanding, what is our understanding in comparison of its excellence? For
then shall be that “peace of God which,” as the apostle says, “passeth all understanding,”
1669—that is to say, all human, and perhaps all angelic understanding, but certainly
not the divine. That it passeth ours there is no doubt; but if it passeth that of the angels,—and
he who says “all understanding” seems to make no exception in their favor,—then we must
understand him to mean that neither we nor the angels can understand, as God understands,
the peace which God Himself enjoys. Doubtless this passeth all understanding but His own.
But as we shall one day be made to participate, according to our slender capacity, in His
peace, both in ourselves, and with our neighbor, and with God our chief good, in this respect
the angels understand the peace of God in their own measure, and men too, though now
far behind them, whatever spiritual advance they have made. For we must remember how
great a man he was who said, “We know in part, and we prophesy in part, until that which
is perfect is come;”1670 and “Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.”1671
Such also is now the vision of the holy angels, who are also called our angels, because we,
being rescued out of the power of darkness, and receiving the earnest of the Spirit, are
translated into the kingdom of Christ, and already begin to belong to those angels with
whom we shall enjoy that holy and most delightful city of God of which we have now written
so much. Thus, then, the angels of God are our angels, as Christ is God’s and also ours.
They are God’s, because they have not abandoned Him; they are ours, because we are their
fellow-citizens. The Lord Jesus also said, “See that ye despise not one of these little ones:
for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always see the face of my Father which is
in heaven.”1672 As, then, they see, so shall we also see; but not yet do we thus see. Wherefore
the apostle uses the words cited a little ago, “Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then
face to face.” This vision is reserved as the reward of our faith; and of it the Apostle John
also says, “When He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.”1673

<pb n="1144"/>
By “the face” of God we are to understand His manifestation, and not a part of the body
similar to that which in our bodies we call by that name.</p>
<p>And so, when I am asked how the saints shall be employed in that spiritual body, I do
not say what I see, but I say what I believe, according to that which I read in the psalm, “I
believed, therefore have I spoken.”1674 I say, then, they shall in the body see God; but
whether they shall see Him by means of the body, as now we see the sun, moon, stars, sea,
earth, and all that is in it, that is a difficult question. For it is hard to say that the saints shall
then have such bodies that they shall not be able to shut and open their eyes as they please;
while it is harder still to say that every one who shuts his eyes shall lose the vision of God.
For if the prophet Elisha, though at a distance, saw his servant Gehazi, who thought that
his wickedness would escape his master’s observation and accepted gifts from Naaman the
Syrian, whom the prophet had cleansed from his foul leprosy, how much more shall the
saints in the spiritual body see all things, not only though their eyes be shut, but though
they themselves be at a great distance? For then shall be “that which is perfect,” of which
the apostle says, “We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect
is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.” Then, that he may illustrate as well
as possible, by a simile, how superior the future life is to the life now lived, not only by ordinary
men, but even by the foremost of the saints, he says, “When I was a child, I understood
as a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away
childish things. Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in
part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.”1675 If, then, even in this life, in which
the prophetic power of remarkable men is no more worthy to be compared to the vision of
the future life than childhood is to manhood, Elisha, though distant from his servant, saw
him accepting gifts, shall we say that when that which is perfect is come, and the corruptible
body no longer oppresses the soul, but is incorruptible and offers no impediment to it, the
saints shall need bodily eyes to see, though Elisha had no need of them to see his servant?
For, following the Septuagint version, these are the prophet’s words: “Did not my heart go
with thee, when the man came out of his chariot to meet thee, and thou tookedst his
gifts?”1676 Or, as the presbyter Jerome rendered it from the Hebrew, “Was not my heart
present when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee?” The prophet said that he saw
this with his heart, miraculously aided by God, as no one can doubt. But how much more
abundantly shall the saints enjoy this gift when God shall be all in all? Nevertheless the
bodily eyes also shall have their office and their place, and shall be used by the spirit through
the spiritual body. For the prophet did not forego the use of his eyes for seeing what was
<note type="footnote">1674 Ps. cxvi. 10.</note>

<pb n="1145"/>
before them, though he did not need them to see his absent servant, and though he could
have seen these present objects in spirit, and with his eyes shut, as he saw things far distant
in a place where he himself was not. Far be it, then, from us to say that in the life to come
the saints shall not see God when their eyes are shut, since they shall always see Him with
the spirit.</p>
<p>But the question arises, whether, when their eyes are open, they shall see Him with the
bodily eye? If the eyes of the spiritual body have no more power than the eyes which we
now possess, manifestly God cannot be seen with them. They must be of a very different
power if they can look upon that incorporeal nature which is not contained in any place,
but is all in every place. For though we say that God is in heaven and on earth, as He,
Himself says by the prophet, “I fill heaven and earth,”1677 we do not mean that there is one
part of God in heaven and another part on earth; but He is all in heaven and all on earth,
not at alternate intervals of time, but both at once, as no bodily nature can be. The eye,
then, shall have a vastly superior power,—the power not of keen sight, such as is ascribed
to serpents or eagles, for however keenly these animals see, they can discern nothing but
bodily substances,—but the power of seeing things incorporeal. Possibly it was this great
power of vision which was temporarily communicated to the eyes of the holy Job while yet
in this mortal body, when he says to God, “I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear;
but now mine eye seeth Thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and melt away, and count myself
dust and ashes;”1678 although there is no reason why we should not understand this of the
eye of the heart, of which the apostle says, “Having the eyes of your heart illuminated.”1679
But that God shall be seen with these eyes no Christian doubts who believingly accepts what
our God and Master says, “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”1680 But
whether in the future life God shall also be seen with the bodily eye, this is now our question.</p>
<p>The expression of Scripture, “And all flesh shall see the salvation of God,”1681 may
without difficulty be understood as if it were said, “And every man shall see the Christ of
God.” And He certainly was seen in the body, and shall be seen in the body when He judges
quick and dead. And that Christ is the salvation of God, many other passages of Scripture
witness, but especially the words of the venerable Simeon, who, when he had received into
his hands the infant Christ, said, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according
to Thy word: for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.”1682 As for the words of the above-

<pb n="1146"/>
mentioned Job, as they are found in the Hebrew manuscripts, “And in my flesh I shall see
God,”1683 no doubt they were a prophecy of the resurrection of the flesh; yet he does not
say “by the flesh.” And indeed, if he had said this, it would still be possible that Christ was
meant by “God;” for Christ shall be seen by the flesh in the flesh. But even understanding
it of God, it is only equivalent to saying, I shall be in the flesh when I see God. Then the
apostle’s expression, “face to face,”1684 does not oblige us to believe that we shall see God
by the bodily face in which are the eyes of the body, for we shall see Him without intermission
in spirit. And if the apostle had not referred to the face of the inner man, he would not
have said, “But we, with unveiled face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the spirit of the Lord.”1685 In
the same sense we understand what the Psalmist sings, “Draw near unto Him, and be enlightened;
and your faces shall not be ashamed.”1686 For it is by faith we draw near to God,
and faith is an act of the spirit, not of the body. But as we do not know what degree of perfection
the spiritual body shall attain,—for here we speak of a matter of which we have no
experience, and upon which the authority of Scripture does not definitely pronounce,—it
is necessary that the words of the Book of Wisdom be illustrated in us: “The thoughts of
mortal men are timid, and our fore-castings uncertain.”1687</p>
<p>For if that reasoning of the philosophers, by which they attempt to make out that intelligible
or mental objects are so seen by the mind, and sensible or bodily objects so seen by
the body, that the former cannot be discerned by the mind through the body, nor the latter
by the mind itself without the body,—if this reasoning were trustworthy, then it would
certainly follow that God could not be seen by the eye even of a spiritual body. But this
reasoning is exploded both by true reason and by prophetic authority. For who is so little
acquainted with the truth as to say that God has no cognisance of sensible objects? Has He
therefore a body, the eyes of which give Him this knowledge? Moreover, what we have just
been relating of the prophet Elisha, does this not sufficiently show that bodily things can be
discerned by the spirit without the help of the body? For when that servant received the
gifts, certainly this was a bodily or material transaction, yet the prophet saw it not by the
body, but by the spirit. As, therefore, it is agreed that bodies are seen by the spirit, what if
the power of the spiritual body shall be so great that spirit also is seen by the body? For God
is a spirit. Besides, each man recognizes his own life—that life by which he now lives in the
body, and which vivifies these earthly members and causes them to grow—by an interior

sense, and not by his bodily eye; but the life of other men, though it is invisible, he sees with
the bodily eye. For how do we distinguish between living and dead bodies, except by seeing
at once both the body and the life which we cannot see save by the eye? But a life without
a body we cannot see thus.</p>
<p>Wherefore it may very well be, and it is thoroughly credible, that we shall in the future
world see the material forms of the new heavens and the new earth in such a way that we
shall most distinctly recognize God everywhere present and governing all things, material
as well as spiritual, and shall see Him, not as now we understand the invisible things of God,
by the things which are made,1688 and see Him darkly, as in a mirror, and in part, and rather
by faith than by bodily vision of material appearances, but by means of the bodies we shall
wear and which we shall see wherever we turn our eyes. As we do not believe, but see that
the living men around us who are exercising vital functions are alive, though we cannot see
their life without their bodies, but see it most distinctly by means of their bodies, so, wherever
we shall look with those spiritual eyes of our future bodies, we shall then, too, by means of
bodily substances behold God, though a spirit, ruling all things. Either, therefore, the eyes
shall possess some quality similar to that of the mind, by which they may be able to discern
spiritual things, and among these God,—a supposition for which it is difficult or even impossible
to find any support in Scripture,—or, which is more easy to comprehend, God will
be so known by us, and shall be so much before us, that we shall see Him by the spirit in
ourselves, in one another, in Himself, in the new heavens and the new earth, in every created
thing which shall then exist; and also by the body we shall see Him in every body which the
keen vision of the eye of the spiritual body shall reach. Our thoughts also shall be visible to
all, for then shall be fulfilled the words of the apostle, “Judge nothing before the time, until
the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make
manifest the thoughts of the heart, and then shall every one have praise of God.”1689</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—Of the Eternal Felicity of the City of God, and of the Perpetual Sabbath.</head>
<p>How great shall be that felicity, which shall be tainted with no evil, which shall lack no
good, and which shall afford leisure for the praises of God, who shall be all in all! For I
know not what other employment there can be where no lassitude shall slacken activity,
nor any want stimulate to labor. I am admonished also by the sacred song, in which I read
or hear the words, “Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house, O Lord; they will be still
praising Thee.”1690 All the members and organs of the incorruptible body, which now we
see to be suited to various necessary uses, shall contribute to the praises of God; for in that
life necessity shall have no place, but full, certain, secure, everlasting felicity. For all those
parts1691 of the bodily harmony, which are distributed through the whole body, within and
without, and of which I have just been saying that they at present elude our observation,
shall then be discerned; and, along with the other great and marvellous discoveries which
shall then kindle rational minds in praise of the great Artificer, there shall be the enjoyment
of a beauty which appeals to the reason. What power of movement such bodies shall possess,
I have not the audacity rashly to define, as I have not the ability to conceive. Nevertheless
I will say that in any case, both in motion and at rest, they shall be, as in their appearance,
seemly; for into that state nothing which is unseemly shall be admitted. One thing is certain,
the body shall forthwith be wherever the spirit wills, and the spirit shall will nothing which
is unbecoming either to the spirit or to the body. True honor shall be there, for it shall be
denied to none who is worthy, nor yielded to any unworthy; neither shall any unworthy
person so much as sue for it, for none but the worthy shall be there. True peace shall be
there, where no one shall suffer opposition either from himself or any other. God Himself,
who is the Author of virtue, shall there be its reward; for, as there is nothing greater or better,
He has promised Himself. What else was meant by His word through the prophet, “I will
be your God, and ye shall be my people,”1692 than, I shall be their satisfaction, I shall be all
that men honorably desire,—life, and health, and nourishment, and plenty, and glory, and
honor, and peace, and all good things? This, too, is the right interpretation of the saying of
the apostle, “That God may be all in all.”1693 He shall be the end of our desires who shall
be seen without end, loved without cloy, praised without weariness. This outgoing of affection,
this employment, shall certainly be, like eternal life itself, common to all.</p>
<p>But who can conceive, not to say describe, what degrees of honor and glory shall be
awarded to the various degrees of merit? Yet it cannot be doubted that there shall be degrees.
And in that blessed city there shall be this great blessing, that no inferior shall envy any su-

perior, as now the archangels are not envied by the angels, because no one will wish to be
what he has not received, though bound in strictest concord with him who has received; as
in the body the finger does not seek to be the eye, though both members are harmoniously
included in the complete structure of the body. And thus, along with his gift, greater or
less, each shall receive this further gift of contentment to desire no more than he has.</p>
<p>Neither are we to suppose that because sin shall have no power to delight them, free
will must be withdrawn. It will, on the contrary, be all the more truly free, because set free
from delight in sinning to take unfailing delight in not sinning. For the first freedom of will
which man received when he was created upright consisted in an ability not to sin, but also
in an ability to sin; whereas this last freedom of will shall be superior, inasmuch as it shall
not be able to sin. This, indeed, shall not be a natural ability, but the gift of God. For it is
one thing to be God, another thing to be a partaker of God. God by nature cannot sin, but
the partaker of God receives this inability from God. And in this divine gift there was to be
observed this gradation, that man should first receive a free will by which he was able not
to sin, and at last a free will by which he was not able to sin,—the former being adapted to
the acquiring of merit, the latter to the enjoying of the reward.1694 But the nature thus
constituted, having sinned when it had the ability to do so, it is by a more abundant grace
that it is delivered so as to reach that freedom in which it cannot sin. For as the first immortality
which Adam lost by sinning consisted in his being able not to die, while the last shall
consist in his not being able to die; so the first free will consisted in his being able not to sin,
the last in his not being able to sin. And thus piety and justice shall be as indefeasible as
happiness. For certainly by sinning we lost both piety and happiness; but when we lost
happiness, we did not lose the love of it. Are we to say that God Himself is not free because
He cannot sin? In that city, then, there shall be free will, one in all the citizens, and indivisible
in each, delivered from all ill, filled with all good, enjoying indefeasibly the delights of
eternal joys, oblivious of sins, oblivious of sufferings, and yet not so oblivious of its deliverance
as to be ungrateful to its Deliverer.</p>
<p>The soul, then, shall have an intellectual remembrance of its past ills; but, so far as regards
sensible experience, they shall be quite forgotten. For a skillful physician knows, indeed,
professionally almost all diseases; but experimentally he is ignorant of a great number which
he himself has never suffered from. As, therefore, there are two ways of knowing evil
things,—one by mental insight, the other by sensible experience, for it is one thing to understand
all vices by the wisdom of a cultivated mind, another to understand them by the
foolishness of an abandoned life,—so also there are two ways of forgetting evils. For a wellinstructed
and learned man forgets them one way, and he who has experimentally suffered
from them forgets them another,—the former by neglecting what he has learned, the latter
<note type="footnote">1694 Or, the former to a state of probation, the latter to a state of reward.</note>

<pb n="1150"/>
by escaping what he has suffered. And in this latter way the saints shall forget their past ills,
for they shall have so thoroughly escaped them all, that they shall be quite blotted out of
their experience. But their intellectual knowledge, which shall be great, shall keep them
acquainted not only with their own past woes, but with the eternal sufferings of the lost.
For if they were not to know that they had been miserable, how could they, as the Psalmist
says, for ever sing the mercies of God? Certainly that city shall have no greater joy than the
celebration of the grace of Christ, who redeemed us by His blood. There shall be accomplished
the words of the psalm, “Be still, and know that I am God.”1695 There shall be the
great Sabbath which has no evening, which God celebrated among His first works, as it is
written, “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had made. And
God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from all His
work which God began to make.”1696 For we shall ourselves be the seventh day, when we
shall be filled and replenished with God’s blessing and sanctification. There shall we be still,
and know that He is God; that He is that which we ourselves aspired to be when we fell away
from Him, and listened to the voice of the seducer, “Ye shall be as gods,”1697 and so abandoned
God, who would have made us as gods, not by deserting Him, but by participating
in Him. For without Him what have we accomplished, save to perish in His anger? But
when we are restored by Him, and perfected with greater grace, we shall have eternal leisure
to see that He is God, for we shall be full of Him when He shall be all in all. For even our
good works, when they are understood to be rather His than ours, are imputed to us that
we may enjoy this Sabbath rest. For if we attribute them to ourselves, they shall be servile;
for it is said of the Sabbath, “Ye shall do no servile work in it.”1698 Wherefore also it is said
by Ezekiel the prophet, “And I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them,
that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctify them.”1699 This knowledge shall be
perfected when we shall be perfectly at rest, and shall perfectly know that He is God.</p>
<p>This Sabbath shall appear still more clearly if we count the ages as days, in accordance
with the periods of time defined in Scripture, for that period will be found to be the seventh.
The first age, as the first day, extends from Adam to the deluge; the second from the deluge
to Abraham, equalling the first, not in length of time, but in the number of generations,
there being ten in each. From Abraham to the advent of Christ there are, as the evangelist
Matthew calculates, three periods, in each of which are fourteen generations,—one period
from Abraham to David, a second from David to the captivity, a third from the captivity to

the birth of Christ in the flesh. There are thus five ages in all. The sixth is now passing, and
cannot be measured by any number of generations, as it has been said, “It is not for you to
know the times, which the Father hath put in His own power.”1700 After this period God
shall rest as on the seventh day, when He shall give us (who shall be the seventh day) rest
in Himself.1701 But there is not now space to treat of these ages; suffice it to say that the
seventh shall be our Sabbath, which shall be brought to a close, not by an evening, but by
the Lord’s day, as an eighth and eternal day, consecrated by the resurrection of Christ, and
prefiguring the eternal repose not only of the spirit, but also of the body. There we shall
rest and see, see and love, love and praise. This is what shall be in the end without end. For
what other end do we propose to ourselves than to attain to the kingdom of which there is
no end?</p>
<p>I think I have now, by God’s help, discharged my obligation in writing this large work.
Let those who think I have said too little, or those who think I have said too much, forgive
me; and let those who think I have said just enough join me in giving thanks to God. Amen.</p>

<head>Introductory Note by the Editor.</head>
<p>The four books of St. Augustin On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana, iv libri)
are a compend of exegetical theology to guide the reader in the understanding and interpretation
of the Sacred Scriptures, according to the analogy of faith. The first three books were
written a.d. 397; the fourth was added 426.</p>
<p>He speaks of it in his Retractations, Bk. ii., chap. 4, as follows:</p>
<p>“Finding that the books on Christian Doctrine were not finished, I thought it better to
complete them before passing on to the revision of others. Accordingly, I completed the
third book, which had been written as far as the place where a quotation is made from the
Gospel about the woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal till the whole
was leavened.1702 I added also the last book, and finished the whole work in four books <del>in
the year 426</del>: the first three affording aids to the interpretation of Scripture, the last giving
directions as to the mode of making known our interpretation. In the second book,1703 I
made a mistake as to the authorship of the book commonly called the Wisdom of Solomon.
For I have since learnt that it is not a well-established fact, as I said it was, that Jesus the son
of Sirach, who wrote the book of Ecclesiasticus, wrote this book also: on the contrary, I
have ascertained that it is altogether more probable that he was not the author of this book.
Again, when I said, ‘The authority of the Old Testament is contained within the limits of
these forty-four books,’1704 I used the phrase ‘Old Testament’ in accordance with ecclesiastical
usage. But the apostle seems to restrict the application of the name ‘Old Testament’ to
the law which was given on Mount Sinai.1705 And in what I said as to St. Ambrose having,
by his knowledge of chronology, solved a great difficulty, when he showed that Plato and
Jeremiah were contemporaries,1706 my memory betrayed me. What that great bishop really
did say upon this subject may be seen in the book which he wrote, ‘On Sacraments or
Philosophy.’”1707</p>

<head>Contents of Christian Doctrine.</head>
<p>Preface, Showing the Utility of the Treatise on Christian Doctrine.</p>
<p>Book I.</p>
<p>Containing a General View of the Subjects Treated in Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>The author divides his work into two parts, one relating to the discovery, the other to the
expression, of the true sense of Scripture. He shows that to discover the meaning we
must attend both to things and to signs, as it is necessary to know what things we ought
to teach to the Christian people, and also the signs of these things, that is, where the
knowledge of these things is to be sought. In this first book he treats of things, which
he divides into three classes,—things to be enjoyed, things to be used, and things which
use and enjoy. The only object which ought to be enjoyed is the Triune God, who is
our highest good and our true happiness. We are prevented by our sins from enjoying
God; and that our sins might be taken away, “The Word was made Flesh,” our Lord
suffered, and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, taking to Himself as his
bride the Church, in which we receive remission of our sins. And if our sins are remitted
and our souls renewed by grace, we may await with hope the resurrection of the body
to eternal glory; if not, we shall be raised to everlasting punishment. These matters relating
to faith having been expounded, the author goes on to show that all objects, except
God, are for use; for, though some of them may be loved, yet our love is not to rest in
them, but to have reference to God. And we ourselves are not objects of enjoyment to
God: he uses us, but for our own advantage. He then goes on to show that love—the
love of God for His own sake and the love of our neighbor for God’s sake—is the fulfillment
and the end of all Scripture. After adding a few words about hope, he shows, in
conclusion, that faith, hope, and love are graces essentially necessary for him who would
understand and explain aright the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>Book II.</p>
<p>Having completed his exposition of things, the author now proceeds to discuss the subject
of signs. He first defines what a sign is, and shows that there are two classes of signs,
the natural and the conventional. Of conventional signs (which are the only class here
noticed), words are the most numerous and important, and are those with which the
interpreter of Scripture is chiefly concerned. The difficulties and obscurities of Scripture
spring chiefly from two sources, unknown and ambiguous signs. The present book

<pb n="1155"/>
deals only with unknown signs, the ambiguities of language being reserved for treatment
in the next book. The difficulty arising from ignorance of signs is to be removed by
learning the Greek and Hebrew languages, in which Scripture is written, by comparing
the various translations, and by attending to the context. In the interpretation of figurative
expressions, knowledge of things is as necessary as knowledge of words; and the
various sciences and arts of the heathen, so far as they are true and useful, may be turned
to account in removing our ignorance of signs, whether these be direct or figurative.
Whilst exposing the folly and futility of many heathen superstitions and practices, the
author points out how all that is sound and useful in their science and philosophy may
be turned to a Christian use. And in conclusion, he shows the spirit in which it behoves
us to address ourselves to the study and interpretation of the sacred books.</p>

<p>Book III. 518</p>
<p>The author, having discussed in the preceding book the method of dealing with unknown
signs, goes on in this third book to treat of ambiguous signs. Such signs may be either
direct or figurative. In the case of direct signs ambiguity may arise from the punctuation,
the pronunciation, or the doubtful signification of the words, and is to be resolved by
attention to the context, a comparison of translations, or a reference to the original
tongue. In the case of figurative signs we need to guard against two mistakes:—1. the
interpreting literal expressions figuratively; 2. the interpreting figurative expressions
literally. The author lays down rules by which we may decide whether an expression is
literal or figurative; the general rule being, that whatever can be shown to be in its literal
sense inconsistent either with purity of life or correctness of doctrine must be taken
figuratively. He then goes on to lay down rules for the interpretation of expressions
which have been proved to be figurative; the general principle being, that no interpretation
can be true which does not promote the love of God and the love of man. The
author then proceeds to expound and illustrate the seven rules of Tichonius the
Donatist, which he commends to the attention of the student of Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>Book IV.</p>
<p>Passing to the second part of his work, that which treats of expression, the author premises
that it is no part of his intention to write a treatise on the laws of rhetoric. These can
be learned elsewhere, and ought not to be neglected, being indeed specially necessary
for the Christian teacher, whom it behoves to excell in eloquence and power of speech.
After detailing with much care and minuteness the various qualities of an orator, he
recommends the authors of the Holy Scriptures as the best models of eloquence, far

<pb n="1156"/>
excelling all others in the combination of eloquence with wisdom. He points out that
perspicuity is the most essential quality of style, and ought to be cultivated with especial
care by the teacher, as it is the main requisite for instruction, although other qualities
are required for delighting and persuading the hearer. All these gifts are to be sought
in earnest prayer from God, though we are not to forget to be zealous and diligent in
study. He shows that there are three species of style,—the subdued, the elegant, and
the majestic; the first serving for instruction, the second for praise, and the third for
exhortation: and of each of these he gives examples, selected both from Scripture and
from early teachers of the Church, Cyprian and Ambrose. He shows that these various
styles may be mingled, and when and for what purposes they are mingled; and that they
all have the same end in view, to bring home the truth to the hearer, so that he may
understand it, hear it with gladness, and practice it in his life. Finally, he exhorts the
Christian teacher himself, pointing out the dignity and responsibility of the office he
holds, to lead a life in harmony with his own teaching, and to show a good example to
all.</p>
</div>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<pb n="1157"/>
<p>Preface.</p>
<p>Showing that to teach rules for the interpretation of Scripture is not a superfluous task.</p>
<p>1. There are certain rules for the interpretation of Scripture which I think might with
great advantage be taught to earnest students of the word, that they may profit not only
from reading the works of others who have laid open the secrets of the sacred writings, but
also from themselves opening such secrets to others. These rules I propose to teach to those
who are able and willing to learn, if God our Lord do not withhold from me, while I write,
the thoughts He is wont to vouchsafe to me in my meditations on this subject. But before
I enter upon this undertaking, I think it well to meet the objections of those who are likely
to take exception to the work, or who would do so, did I not conciliate them beforehand.
And if, after all, men should still be found to make objections, yet at least they will not prevail
with others (over whom they might have influence, did they not find them forearmed against
their assaults), to turn them back from a useful study to the dull sloth of ignorance.</p>
<p>2. There are some, then, likely to object to this work of mine, because they have failed
to understand the rules here laid down. Others, again, will think that I have spent my labor
to no purpose, because, though they understand the rules, yet in their attempts to apply
them and to interpret Scripture by them, they have failed to clear up the point they wish
cleared up; and these, because they have received no assistance from this work themselves,
will give it as their opinion that it can be of no use to anybody. There is a third class of objectors
who either really do understand Scripture well, or think they do, and who, because
they know (or imagine) that they have attained a certain power of interpreting the sacred
books without reading any directions of the kind that I propose to lay down here, will cry
out that such rules are not necessary for any one, but that everything rightly done towards
clearing up the obscurities of Scripture could be better done by the unassisted grace of God.</p>
<p>3. To reply briefly to all these. To those who do not understand what is here set down,
my answer is, that I am not to be blamed for their want of understanding. It is just as if they
were anxious to see the new or the old moon, or some very obscure star, and I should point
it out with my finger: if they had not sight enough to see even my finger, they would surely
have no right to fly into a passion with me on that account. As for those who, even though
they know and understand my directions, fail to penetrate the meaning of obscure passages
in Scripture, they may stand for those who, in the case I have imagined, are just able to see
my finger, but cannot see the stars at which it is pointed. And so both these classes had
better give up blaming me, and pray instead that God would grant them the sight of their
eyes. For though I can move my finger to point out an object, it is out of my power to open
men’s eyes that they may see either the fact that I am pointing, or the object at which I point.</p>
<p>4. But now as to those who talk vauntingly of Divine Grace, and boast that they understand
and can explain Scripture without the aid of such directions as those I now propose
to lay down, and who think, therefore, that what I have undertaken to write is entirely su-

<pb n="1158"/>
perfluous. I would such persons could calm themselves so far as to remember that, however
justly they may rejoice in God’s great gift, yet it was from human teachers they themselves
learnt to read. Now, they would hardly think it right that they should for that reason be
held in contempt by the Egyptian monk Antony, a just and holy man, who, not being able
to read himself, is said to have committed the Scriptures to memory through hearing them
read by others, and by dint of wise meditation to have arrived at a thorough understanding
of them; or by that barbarian slave Christianus, of whom I have lately heard from very respectable
and trustworthy witnesses, who, without any teaching from man, attained a full
knowledge of the art of reading simply through prayer that it might be revealed to him; after
three days’ supplication obtaining his request that he might read through a book presented
to him on the spot by the astonished bystanders.</p>
<p>5. But if any one thinks that these stories are false, I do not strongly insist on them.
For, as I am dealing with Christians who profess to understand the Scriptures without any
directions from man (and if the fact be so, they boast of a real advantage, and one of no ordinary
kind), they must surely grant that every one of us learnt his own language by hearing
it constantly from childhood, and that any other language we have learnt,—Greek, or Hebrew,
or any of the rest,—we have learnt either in the same way, by hearing it spoken, or from a
human teacher. Now, then, suppose we advise all our brethren not to teach their children
any of these things, because on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit the apostles immediately
began to speak the language of every race; and warn every one who has not had a like experience
that he need not consider himself a Christian, or may at least doubt whether he has
yet received the Holy Spirit? No, no; rather let us put away false pride and learn whatever
can be learnt from man; and let him who teaches another communicate what he has himself
received without arrogance and without jealousy. And do not let us tempt Him in whom
we have believed, lest, being ensnared by such wiles of the enemy and by our own perversity,
we may even refuse to go to the churches to hear the gospel itself, or to read a book, or to
listen to another reading or preaching, in the hope that we shall be carried up to the third
heaven, “whether in the body or out of the body,” as the apostle says,1708 and there hear
unspeakable words, such as it is not lawful for man to utter, or see the Lord Jesus Christ and
hear the gospel from His own lips rather than from those of men.</p>
<p>6. Let us beware of such dangerous temptations of pride, and let us rather consider the
fact that the Apostle Paul himself, although stricken down and admonished by the voice of
God from heaven, was yet sent to a man to receive the sacraments and be admitted into the
Church;1709 and that Cornelius the centurion, although an angel announced to him that
his prayers were heard and his alms had in remembrance, was yet handed over to Peter for
<note type="footnote">1708 2 Cor. xii. 2-4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1709 Acts ix. 3.</note>

<pb n="1159"/>
instruction, and not only received the sacraments from the apostle’s hands, but was also
instructed by him as to the proper objects of faith, hope, and love.1710 And without doubt
it was possible to have done everything through the instrumentality of angels, but the condition
of our race would have been much more degraded if God had not chosen to make use
of men as the ministers of His word to their fellow-men. For how could that be true which
is written, “The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are,”1711 if God gave forth no oracles
from His human temple, but communicated everything that He wished to be taught to men
by voices from heaven, or through the ministration of angels? Moreover, love itself, which
binds men together in the bond of unity, would have no means of pouring soul into soul,
and, as it were, mingling them one with another, if men never learnt anything from their
fellow-men.</p>
<p>7. And we know that the eunuch who was reading Isaiah the prophet, and did not understand
what he read, was not sent by the apostle to an angel, nor was it an angel who explained
to him what he did not understand, nor was he inwardly illuminated by the grace
of God without the interposition of man; on the contrary, at the suggestion of God, Philip,
who did understand the prophet, came to him, and sat with him, and in human words, and
with a human tongue, opened to him the Scriptures.1712 Did not God talk with Moses, and
yet he, with great wisdom and entire absence of jealous pride, accepted the plan of his fatherin-
law, a man of an alien race, for ruling and administering the affairs of the great nation
entrusted to him?1713 For Moses knew that a wise plan, in whatever mind it might originate,
was to be ascribed not to the man who devised it, but to Him who is the Truth, the unchangeable
God.</p>
<p>8. In the last place, every one who boasts that he, through divine illumination, understands
the obscurities of Scripture, though not instructed in any rules of interpretation, at
the same time believes, and rightly believes, that this power is not his own, in the sense of
originating with himself, but is the gift of God. For so he seeks God’s glory, not his own.
But reading and understanding, as he does, without the aid of any human interpreter, why
does he himself undertake to interpret for others? Why does he not rather send them direct
to God, that they too may learn by the inward teaching of the Spirit without the help of
man? The truth is, he fears to incur the re proach: “Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou
oughtest to have put my money to the exchangers.”1714 Seeing, then, that these men teach

me if I likewise teach not only what they understand, but also the rules of interpretation
they follow. For no one ought to consider anything as his own, except perhaps what is false.
All truth is of Him who says, “I am the truth.”1715 For what have we that we did not receive?
and if we have received it, why do we glory, as if we had not received it?1716</p>
<p>9. He who reads to an audience pronounces aloud the words he sees before him: he
who teaches reading, does it that others may be able to read for themselves. Each, however,
communicates to others what he has learnt himself. Just so, the man who explains to an
audience the passages of Scripture he understands is like one who reads aloud the words
before him. On the other hand, the man who lays down rules for interpretation is like one
who teaches reading, that is, shows others how to read for themselves. So that, just as he
who knows how to read is not dependent on some one else, when he finds a book, to tell
him what is written in it, so the man who is in possession of the rules which I here attempt
to lay down, if he meet with an obscure passage in the books which he reads, will not need
an interpreter to lay open the secret to him, but, holding fast by certain rules, and following
up certain indications, will arrive at the hidden sense without any error, or at least without
falling into any gross absurdity. And so although it will sufficiently appear in the course of
the work itself that no one can justly object to this undertaking of mine, which has no other
object than to be of service, yet as it seemed convenient to reply at the outset to any who
might make preliminary objections, such is the start I have thought good to make on the
road I am about to traverse in this book.</p>

<head>Book I.</head>
<p>Containing a General View of the Subjects Treated in Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Argument—The author divides his work into two parts, one relating to the discovery, the
other to the expression, of the true sense of scripture. He shows that to discover the meaning
we must attend both to things and to signs, as it is necessary to know what things we ought to
teach to the Christian people, and also the signs of these things, that is, where the knowledge
of these things is to be sought. In this first book he treats of things, which he divides into three
classes,—things to be enjoyed, things to be used, and things which use and enjoy. The only
object which ought to be enjoyed is the triune God, who is our highest good and our true
happiness. We are prevented by our sins from enjoying God; and that our sins might be taken
away, “the word was made flesh,” our Lord suffered, and died, and rose again, and ascended
into heaven, taking to himself as his bride the church, in which we receive remission of our
sins. And if our sins are remitted and our souls renewed by grace, we may await with hope
the resurrection of the body to eternal glory; if not, we shall be raised to everlasting punishment.
These matters relating to faith having been expounded, the author goes on to show that all
objects, except God, are for use; for, though some of them may be loved, yet our love is not to
rest in them, but to have reference to God. And we ourselves are not objects of enjoyment to
God; he uses us, but for our own advantage. He then goes on to show that love—the love of
God for his own sake and the love of our neighbor for God’s sake—is the fulfillment and the
end of all Scripture. After adding a few words about hope, he shows, in conclusion, that faith,
hope, and love are graces essentially necessary for him who would understand and explain
aright the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—The Interpretation of Scripture Depends on the Discovery and Enunciation
of the Meaning, and is to Be Undertaken in Dependence on God’s Aid.</head>
<p>1. There are two things on which all interpretation of Scripture depends: the mode of
ascertaining the proper meaning, and the mode of making known the meaning when it is
ascertained. We shall treat first of the mode of ascertaining, next of the mode of making
known, the meaning;—a great and arduous undertaking, and one that, if difficult to carry
out, it is, I fear, presumptuous to enter upon. And presumptuous it would undoubtedly be,
if I were counting on my own strength; but since my hope of accomplishing the work rests
on Him who has already supplied me with many thoughts on this subject, I do not fear but
that He will go on to supply what is yet wanting when once I have begun to use what He
has already given. For a possession which is not diminished by being shared with others,
if it is possessed and not shared, is not yet possessed as it ought to be possessed. The Lord
saith “Whosoever hath, to him shall be given.”1717 He will give, then, to those who have;
that is to say, if they use freely and cheerfully what they have received, He will add to and
perfect His gifts. The loaves in the miracle were only five and seven in number before the
disciples began to divide them among the hungry people. But when once they began to
distribute them, though the wants of so many thousands were satisfied, they filled baskets
with the fragments that were left.1718 Now, just as that bread increased in the very act of
breaking it, so those thoughts which the Lord has already vouchsafed to me with a view to
undertaking this work will, as soon as I begin to impart them to others, be multiplied by
His grace, so that, in this very work of distribution in which I have engaged, so far from incurring
loss and poverty, I shall be made to rejoice in a marvellous increase of wealth.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—What a Thing Is, and What A Sign.</head>
<p>2. All instruction is either about things or about signs; but things are learnt by means
of signs. I now use the word “thing” in a strict sense, to signify that which is never employed
as a sign of anything else: for example, wood, stone, cattle, and other things of that kind.
Not, however, the wood which we read Moses cast into the bitter waters to make them
sweet,1719 nor the stone which Jacob used as a pillow,1720 nor the ram which Abraham
offered up instead of his son;1721 for these, though they are things, are also signs of other
things. There are signs of another kind, those which are never employed except as signs:
for example, words. No one uses words except as signs of something else; and hence may
be understood what I call signs: those things, to wit, which are used to indicate something
else. Accordingly, every sign is also a thing; for what is not a thing is nothing at all. Every
thing, however, is not also a sign. And so, in regard to this distinction between things and
signs, I shall, when I speak of things, speak in such a way that even if some of them may be
used as signs also, that will not interfere with the division of the subject according to which
I am to discuss things first and signs afterwards. But we must carefully remember that what
we have now to consider about things is what they are in themselves, not what other things
they are signs of.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Some Things are for Use, Some for Enjoyment.</head>
<p>3. There are some things, then, which are to be enjoyed, others which are to be used,
others still which enjoy and use. Those things which are objects of enjoyment make us
happy. Those things which are objects of use assist, and (so to speak) support us in our efforts
after happiness, so that we can attain the things that make us happy and rest in them. We
ourselves, again, who enjoy and use these things, being placed among both kinds of objects,
if we set ourselves to enjoy those which we ought to use, are hindered in our course, and
sometimes even led away from it; so that, getting entangled in the love of lower gratifications,
we lag behind in, or even altogether turn back from, the pursuit of the real and proper objects
of enjoyment.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="1165"/>
<head>Chapter 4.—Difference of Use and Enjoyment.</head>
<p>4. For to enjoy a thing is to rest with satisfaction in it for its own sake. To use, on the
other hand, is to employ whatever means are at one’s disposal to obtain what one desires,
if it is a proper object of desire; for an unlawful use ought rather to be called an abuse.
Suppose, then, we were wanderers in a strange country, and could not live happily away
from our fatherland, and that we felt wretched in our wandering, and wishing to put an end
to our misery, determined to return home. We find, however, that we must make use of
some mode of conveyance, either by land or water, in order to reach that fatherland where
our enjoyment is to commence. But the beauty of the country through which we pass, and
the very pleasure of the motion, charm our hearts, and turning these things which we ought
to use into objects of enjoyment, we become unwilling to hasten the end of our journey;
and becoming engrossed in a factitious delight, our thoughts are diverted from that home
whose delights would make us truly happy. Such is a picture of our condition in this life of
mortality. We have wandered far from God; and if we wish to return to our Father’s home,
this world must be used, not enjoyed, that so the invisible things of God may be clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made,1722—that is, that by means of what is material
and temporary we may lay hold upon that which is spiritual and eternal.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="1166"/>
<head>Chapter 5.—The Trinity the True Object of Enjoyment.</head>
<p>5. The true objects of enjoyment, then, are the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
who are at the same time the Trinity, one Being, supreme above all, and common to all who
enjoy Him, if He is an object, and not rather the cause of all objects, or indeed even if He is
the cause of all. For it is not easy to find a name that will suitably express so great excellence,
unless it is better to speak in this way: The Trinity, one God, of whom are all things, through
whom are all things, in whom are all things.1723 Thus the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit, and each of these by Himself, is God, and at the same time they are all one God; and
each of them by Himself is a complete substance, and yet they are all one substance. The
Father is not the Son nor the Holy Spirit; the Son is not the Father nor the Holy Spirit; the
Holy Spirit is not the Father nor the Son: but the Father is only Father, the Son is only Son,
and the Holy Spirit is only Holy Spirit. To all three belong the same eternity, the same unchangeableness,
the same majesty, the same power. In the Father is unity, in the Son
equality, in the Holy Spirit the harmony of unity and equality; and these three attributes are
all one because of the Father, all equal because of the Son, and all harmonious because of
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—In What Sense God is Ineffable.</head>
<p>6. Have I spoken of God, or uttered His praise, in any worthy way? Nay, I feel that I
have done nothing more than desire to speak; and if I have said anything, it is not what I
desired to say. How do I know this, except from the fact that God is unspeakable? But what
I have said, if it had been unspeakable, could not have been spoken. And so God is not even
to be called “unspeakable,” because to say even this is to speak of Him. Thus there arises a
curious contradiction of words, because if the unspeakable is what cannot be spoken of, it
is not unspeakable if it can be called unspeakable. And this opposition of words is rather
to be avoided by silence than to be explained away by speech. And yet God, although
nothing worthy of His greatness can be said of Him, has condescended to accept the worship
of men’s mouths, and has desired us through the medium of our own words to rejoice in
His praise. For on this principle it is that He is called Deus (God). For the sound of those
two syllables in itself conveys no true knowledge of His nature; but yet all who know the
Latin tongue are led, when that sound reaches their ears, to think of a nature supreme in
excellence and eternal in existence.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="1168"/>
<head>Chapter 7.—What All Men Understand by the Term God.</head>
<p>7. For when the one supreme God of gods is thought of, even by those who believe that
there are other gods, and who call them by that name, and worship them as gods, their
thought takes the form of an endeavor to reach the conception of a nature, than which
nothing more excellent or more exalted exists. And since men are moved by different kinds
of pleasures, partly by those which pertain to the bodily senses, partly by those which pertain
to the intellect and soul, those of them who are in bondage to sense think that either the
heavens, or what appears to be most brilliant in the heavens, or the universe itself, is God
of gods: or if they try to get beyond the universe, they picture to themselves something of
dazzling brightness, and think of it vaguely as infinite, or of the most beautiful form conceivable;
or they represent it in the form of the human body, if they think that superior to all
others. Or if they think that there is no one God supreme above the rest, but that there are
many or even innumerable gods of equal rank, still these too they conceive as possessed of
shape and form, according to what each man thinks the pattern of excellence. Those, on
the other hand, who endeavor by an effort of the intelligence to reach a conception of God,
place Him above all visible and bodily natures, and even above all intelligent and spiritual
natures that are subject to change. All, however, strive emulously to exalt the excellence of
God: nor could any one be found to believe that any being to whom there exists a superior
is God. And so all concur in believing that God is that which excels in dignity all other objects.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="1169"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—God to Be Esteemed Above All Else, Because He is Unchangeable
Wisdom.</head>
<p>8. And since all who think about God think of Him as living, they only can form any
conception of Him that is not absurd and unworthy who think of Him as life itself; and,
whatever may be the bodily form that has suggested itself to them, recognize that it is by
life it lives or does not live, and prefer what is living to what is dead; who understand that
the living bodily form itself, however it may outshine all others in splendor, overtop them
in size, and excel them in beauty, is quite a distinct thing from the life by which it is
quickened; and who look upon the life as incomparably superior in dignity and worth to
the mass which is quickened and animated by it. Then, when they go on to look into the
nature of the life itself, if they find it mere nutritive life, without sensibility, such as that of
plants, they consider it inferior to sentient life, such as that of cattle; and above this, again,
they place intelligent life, such as that of men. And, perceiving that even this is subject to
change, they are compelled to place above it, again, that unchangeable life which is not at
one time foolish, at another time wise, but on the contrary is wisdom itself. For a wise intelligence,
that is, one that has attained to wisdom, was, previous to its attaining wisdom, unwise.
But wisdom itself never was unwise, and never can become so. And if men never
caught sight of this wisdom, they could never with entire confidence prefer a life which is
unchangeably wise to one that is subject to change. This will be evident, if we consider that
the very rule of truth by which they affirm the unchangeable life to be the more excellent,
is itself unchangeable: and they cannot find such a rule, except by going beyond their own
nature; for they find nothing in themselves that is not subject to change.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—All Acknowledge the Superiority of Unchangeable Wisdom to that
Which is Variable.</head>
<p>9. Now, no one is so egregiously silly as to ask, “How do you know that a life of unchangeable
wisdom is preferable to one of change?” For that very truth about which he
asks, how I know it? is unchangeably fixed in the minds of all men, and presented to their
common contemplation. And the man who does not see it is like a blind man in the sun,
whom it profits nothing that the splendor of its light, so clear and so near, is poured into
his very eye-balls. The man, on the other hand, who sees, but shrinks from this truth, is
weak in his mental vision from dwelling long among the shadows of the flesh. And thus
men are driven back from their native land by the contrary blasts of evil habits, and pursue
lower and less valuable objects in preference to that which they own to be more excellent
and more worthy.</p>

<p>10. Wherefore, since it is our duty fully to enjoy the truth which lives unchangeably,
and since the triune God takes counsel in this truth for the things which He has made, the
soul must be purified that it may have power to perceive that light, and to rest in it when it
is perceived. And let us look upon this purification as a kind of journey or voyage to our
native land. For it is not by change of place that we can come nearer to Him who is in every
place, but by the cultivation of pure desires and virtuous habits.</p>

<p>11. But of this we should have been wholly incapable, had not Wisdom condescended
to adapt Himself to our weakness, and to show us a pattern of holy life in the form of our
own humanity. Yet, since we when we come to Him do wisely, He when He came to us was
considered by proud men to have done very foolishly. And since we when we come to Him
become strong, He when He came to us was looked upon as weak. But “the foolishness of
God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.”1724 And thus,
though Wisdom was Himself our home, He made Himself also the way by which we should
reach our home.</p>

weak and dim. “For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God,
it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.”1725</p>
<p>12. Not then in the sense of traversing space, but because He appeared to mortal men
in the form of mortal flesh, He is said to have come to us. For He came to a place where He
had always been, seeing that “He was in the world, and the world was made by Him.” But,
because men, who in their eagerness to enjoy the creature instead of the Creator had grown
into the likeness of this world, and are therefore most appropriately named “the world,” did
not recognize Him, therefore the evangelist says, “and the world knew Him not.”1726 Thus,
in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. Why then did He come, seeing
that He was already here, except that it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching
to save them that believe?</p>

Just as when we speak, in order that what we have in our minds may enter through the ear
into the mind of the hearer, the word which we have in our hearts becomes an outward
sound and is called speech; and yet our thought does not lose itself in the sound, but remains
complete in itself, and takes the form of speech without being modified in its own nature
by the change: so the Divine Word, though suffering no change of nature, yet became flesh,
that He might dwell among us.</p>

<p>13. Moreover, as the use of remedies is the way to health, so this remedy took up sinners
to heal and restore them. And just as surgeons, when they bind up wounds, do it not in a
slovenly way, but carefully, that there may be a certain degree of neatness in the binding, in
addition to its mere usefulness, so our medicine, Wisdom, was by His assumption of humanity
adapted to our wounds, curing some of them by their opposites, some of them by their
likes. And just as he who ministers to a bodily hurt in some cases applies contraries, as cold
to hot, moist to dry, etc., and in other cases applies likes, as a round cloth to a round wound,
or an oblong cloth to an oblong wound, and does not fit the same bandage to all limbs, but
puts like to like; in the same way the Wisdom of God in healing man has applied Himself
to his cure, being Himself healer and medicine both in one. Seeing, then, that man fell
through pride, He restored him through humility. We were ensnared by the wisdom of the
serpent: we are set free by the foolishness of God. Moreover, just as the former was called
wisdom, but was in reality the folly of those who despised God, so the latter is called foolishness,
but is true wisdom in those who overcome the devil. We used our immortality so
badly as to incur the penalty of death: Christ used His mortality so well as to restore us to
life. The disease was brought in through a woman’s corrupted soul: the remedy came
through a woman’s virgin body. To the same class of opposite remedies it belongs, that our
vices are cured by the example of His virtues. On the other hand, the following are, as it
were, bandages made in the same shape as the limbs and wounds to which they are applied:
He was born of a woman to deliver us who fell through a woman: He came as a man to
save us who are men, as a mortal to save us who are mortals, by death to save us who were
dead. And those who can follow out the matter more fully, who are not hurried on by the
necessity of carrying out a set undertaking, will find many other points of instruction in
considering the remedies, whether opposites or likes, employed in the medicine of Christianity.</p>

how freely He laid down His life for us when He had it in His power thus to take it up again.
With what assurance, then, is the hope of believers animated, when they reflect how great
He was who suffered so great things for them while they were still in unbelief! And when
men look for Him to come from heaven as the judge of quick and dead, it strikes great terror
into the careless, so that they betake themselves to diligent preparation, and learn by holy
living to long for His approach, instead of quaking at it on account of their evil deeds. And
what tongue can tell, or what imagination can conceive, the reward He will bestow at the
last, when we consider that for our comfort in this earthly journey He has given us so freely
of His Spirit, that in the adversities of this life we may retain our confidence in, and love

<p>And so faith clings to the assurance, and we must believe that it is so in fact, that neither
the human soul nor the human body suffers complete extinction, but that the wicked rise
again to endure inconceivable punishment, and the good to receive eternal life.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—God Alone to Be Enjoyed.</head>
<p>20. Among all these things, then, those only are the true objects of enjoyment which
we have spoken of as eternal and unchangeable. The rest are for use, that we may be able
to arrive at the full enjoyment of the former. We, however, who enjoy and use other things
are things ourselves. For a great thing truly is man, made after the image and similitude of
God, not as respects the mortal body in which he is clothed, but as respects the rational soul
by which he is exalted in honor above the beasts. And so it becomes an important question,
whether men ought to enjoy, or to use, themselves, or to do both. For we are commanded
to love one another: but it is a question whether man is to be loved by man for his own
sake, or for the sake of something else. If it is for his own sake, we enjoy him; if it is for the
sake of something else, we use him. It seems to me, then, that he is to be loved for the sake
of something else. For if a thing is to be loved for its own sake, then in the enjoyment of it
consists a happy life, the hope of which at least, if not yet the reality, is our comfort in the
present time. But a curse is pronounced on him who places his hope in man.1732</p>
<p>21. Neither ought any one to have joy in himself, if you look at the matter clearly, because
no one ought to love even himself for his own sake, but for the sake of Him who is the true
object of enjoyment. For a man is never in so good a state as when his whole life is a journey
towards the unchangeable life, and his affections are entirely fixed upon that. If, however,
he loves himself for his own sake, he does not look at himself in relation to God, but turns
his mind in upon him self, and so is not occupied with anything that is unchangeable. And
thus he does not enjoy himself at his best, because he is better when his mind is fully fixed
upon, and his affections wrapped up in, the unchangeable good, than when he turns from
that to enjoy even himself. Wherefore if you ought not to love even yourself for your own
sake, but for His in whom your love finds its most worthy object, no other man has a right
to be angry if you love him too for God’s sake. For this is the law of love that has been laid
down by Divine authority: “Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself;” but, “Thou shall love
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind:”1733 so that you are to
concentrate all your thoughts, your whole life and your whole intelligence upon Him from
whom you derive all that you bring. For when He says, “With all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind,” He means that no part of our life is to be unoccupied, and to
afford room, as it were, for the wish to enjoy some other object, but that whatever else may
suggest itself to us as an object worthy of love is to be borne into the same channel in which
the whole current of our affections flows. Whoever, then, loves his neighbor aright, ought
to urge upon him that he too should love God with his whole heart, and soul, and mind.
For in this way, loving his neighbor as himself, a man turns the whole current of his love

stream to be drawn off from itself by whose diversion its own volume would be diminished.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Man Needs No Injunction to Love Himself and His Own Body.</head>
<p>22. Those things which are objects of use are not all, however, to be loved, but those
only which are either united with us in a common relation to God, such as a man or an angel,
or are so related to us as to need the goodness of God through our instrumentality, such as
the body. For assuredly the martyrs did not love the wickedness of their persecutors, although
they used it to attain the favor of God. As, then, there are four kinds of things that are to
be loved,—first, that which is above us; second, ourselves; third, that which is on a level with
us; fourth, that which is beneath us,—no precepts need be given about the second and fourth
of these. For, however far a man may fall away from the truth, he still continues to love
himself, and to love his own body. The soul which flies away from the unchangeable Light,
the Ruler of all things, does so that it may rule over itself and over its own body; and so it
cannot but love both itself and its own body.</p>
<p>23. Morever, it thinks it has attained something very great if it is able to lord it over its
companions, that is, other men. For it is inherent in the sinful soul to desire above all things,
and to claim as due to itself, that which is properly due to God only. Now such love of itself
is more correctly called hate. For it is not just that it should desire what is beneath it to be
obedient to it while itself will not obey its own superior; and most justly has it been said,
“He who loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.”1734 And accordingly the soul becomes weak,
and endures much suffering about the mortal body. For, of course, it must love the body,
and be grieved at its corruption; and the immortality and incorruptibility of the body spring
out of the health of the soul. Now the health of the soul is to cling steadfastly to the better
part, that is, to the unchangeable God. But when it aspires to lord it even over those who
are by nature its equals,—that is, its fellow-men,—this is a reach of arrogance utterly intolerable.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—No Man Hates His Own Flesh, Not Even Those Who Abuse It.</head>
<p>24. No man, then, hates himself. On this point, indeed, no question was ever raised by
any sect. But neither does any man hate his own body. For the apostle says truly, “No man
ever yet hated his own flesh.”1735 And when some people say that they would rather be
without a body altogether, they entirely deceive themselves. For it is not their body, but its
corruptions and its heaviness, that they hate. And so it is not no body, but an uncorrupted
and very light body, that they want. But they think a body of that kind would be no body
at all, because they think such a thing as that must be a spirit. And as to the fact that they
seem in some sort to scourge their bodies by abstinence and toil, those who do this in the
right spirit do it not that they may get rid of their body, but that they may have it in subjection
and ready for every needful work. For they strive by a kind of toilsome exercise of the body
itself to root out those lusts that are hurtful to the body, that is, those habits and affections
of the soul that lead to the enjoyment of unworthy objects. They are not destroying themselves;
they are taking care of their health.</p>
<p>25. Those, on the other hand, who do this in a perverse spirit, make war upon their
own body as if it were a natural enemy. And in this matter they are led astray by a mistaken
interpretation of what they read: “The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other.”1736 For this is said of the carnal habit
yet unsubdued, against which the spirit lusteth, not to destroy the body, but to eradicate the
lust of the body—i.e., its evil habit—and thus to make it subject to the spirit, which is what
the order of nature demands. For as, after the resurrection, the body, having become wholly
subject to the spirit, will live in perfect peace to all eternity; even in this life we must make
it an object to have the carnal habit changed for the better, so that its inordinate affections
may not war against the soul. And until this shall take place, “the flesh lusteth against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;” the spirit struggling, not in hatred, but for the mastery,
because it desires that what it loves should be subject to the higher principle; and the flesh
struggling, not in hatred, but because of the bondage of habit which it has derived from its
parent stock, and which has grown in upon it by a law of nature till it has become inveterate.
The spirit, then, in subduing the flesh, is working as it were to destroy the ill-founded peace
of an evil habit, and to bring about the real peace which springs out of a good habit. Nevertheless,
not even those who, led astray by false notions, hate their bodies would be prepared
to sacrifice one eye, even supposing they could do so without suffering any pain, and that
they had as much sight left in one as they formerly had in two, unless some object was to
be attained which would overbalance the loss. This and other indications of the same kind
are sufficient to show those who candidly seek the truth how well-founded is the statement

<head>Chapter 25.—A Man May Love Something More Than His Body, But Does Not
Therefore Hate His Body.</head>
<p>26. Man, therefore, ought to be taught the due measure of loving, that is, in what
measure he may love himself so as to be of service to himself. For that he does love himself,
and does desire to do good to himself, nobody but a fool would doubt. He is to be taught,
too, in what measure to love his body, so as to care for it wisely and within due limits. For
it is equally manifest that he loves his body also, and desires to keep it safe and sound. And
yet a man may have something that he loves better than the safety and soundness of his
body. For many have been found voluntarily to suffer both pains and amputations of some
of their limbs that they might obtain other objects which they valued more highly. But no
one is to be told not to desire the safety and health of his body because there is something
he desires more. For the miser, though he loves money, buys bread for himself,—that is,
he gives away money that he is very fond of and desires to heap up,—but it is because he
values more highly the bodily health which the bread sustains. It is superfluous to argue
longer on a point so very plain, but this is just what the error of wicked men often compels
us to do.</p>

<head>Chapter 26.—The Command to Love God and Our Neighbor Includes a Command
to Love Ourselves.</head>
<p>27. Seeing, then, that there is no need of a command that every man should love himself
and his own body,—seeing, that is, that we love ourselves, and what is beneath us but connected
with us, through a law of nature which has never been violated, and which is common
to us with the beasts (for even the beasts love themselves and their own bodies),—it only
remained necessary to lay injunctions upon us in regard to God above us, and our neighbor
beside us. “Thou shalt love,” He says, “the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind; and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two
commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”1738 Thus the end of the commandment
is love, and that twofold, the love of God and the love of our neighbor. Now, if you take
yourself in your entirety,—that is, soul and body together,—and your neighbor in his entirety,
soul and body together (for man is made up of soul and body), you will find that none of
the classes of things that are to be loved is overlooked in these two commandments. For
though, when the love of God comes first, and the measure of our love for Him is prescribed
in such terms that it is evident all other things are to find their centre in Him, nothing seems
to be said about our love for ourselves; yet when it is said, “Thou shall love thy neighbor as
thyself,” it at once becomes evident that our love for ourselves has not been overlooked.</p>

<head>Chapter 27.—The Order of Love.</head>
<p>28. Now he is a man of just and holy life who forms an unprejudiced estimate of things,
and keeps his affections also under strict control, so that he neither loves what he ought not
to love, nor fails to love what he ought to love, nor loves that more which ought to be loved
less, nor loves that equally which ought to be loved either less or more, nor loves that less
or more which ought to be loved equally. No sinner is to be loved as a sinner; and every
man is to be loved as a man for God’s sake; but God is to be loved for His own sake. And
if God is to be loved more than any man, each man ought to love God more than himself.
Likewise we ought to love another man better than our own body, because all things are to
be loved in reference to God, and another man can have fellowship with us in the enjoyment
of God, whereas our body cannot; for the body only lives through the soul, and it is by the
soul that we enjoy God.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—How We are to Decide Whom to Aid.</head>
<p>29. Further, all men are to be loved equally. But since you cannot do good to all, you
are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstance,
are brought into closer connection with you. For, suppose that you had a great deal of some
commodity, and felt bound to give it away to somebody who had none, and that it could
not be given to more than one person; if two persons presented themselves, neither of whom
had either from need or relationship a greater claim upon you than the other, you could do
nothing fairer than choose by lot to which you would give what could not be given to both.
Just so among men: since you cannot consult for the good of them all, you must take the
matter as decided for you by a sort of lot, according as each man happens for the time being
to be more closely connected with you.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
<pb n="1192"/>
<head>Chapter 29.—We are to Desire and Endeavor that All Men May Love God.</head>
<p>30. Now of all who can with us enjoy God, we love partly those to whom we render
services, partly those who render services to us, partly those who both help us in our need
and in turn are helped by us, partly those upon whom we confer no advantage and from
whom we look for none. We ought to desire, however, that they should all join with us in
loving God, and all the assistance that we either give them or accept from them should tend
to that one end. For in the theatres, dens of iniquity though they be, if a man is fond of a
particular actor, and enjoys his art as a great or even as the very greatest good, he is fond of
all who join with him in admiration of his favorite, not for their own sakes, but for the sake
of him whom they admire in common; and the more fervent he is in his admiration, the
more he works in every way he can to secure new admirers for him, and the more anxious
he becomes to show him to others; and if he find any one comparatively indifferent, he does
all he can to excite his interest by urging his favorite’s merits: if, however, he meet with any
one who opposes him, he is exceedingly displeased by such a man’s contempt of his favorite,
and strives in every way he can to remove it. Now, if this be so, what does it become us to
do who live in the fellowship of the love of God, the enjoyment of whom is true happiness
of life, to whom all who love Him owe both their own existence and the love they bear Him,
concerning whom we have no fear that any one who comes to know Him will be disappointed
in Him, and who desires our love, not for any gain to Himself, but that those who love Him
may obtain an eternal reward, even Himself whom they love? And hence it is that we love
even our enemies. For we do not fear them, seeing they cannot take away from us what we
love; but we pity them rather, because the more they hate us the more are they separated
from Him whom we love. For if they would turn to Him, they must of necessity love Him
as the supreme good, and love us too as partakers with them in so great a blessing.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
<pb n="1193"/>
<head>Chapter 30.—Whether Angels are to Be Reckoned Our Neighbors.</head>
<p>31. There arises further in this connection a question about angels. For they are happy
in the enjoyment of Him whom we long to enjoy; and the more we enjoy Him in this life
as through a glass darkly, the more easy do we find it to bear our pilgrimage, and the more
eagerly do we long for its termination. But it is not irrational to ask whether in those two
commandments is included the love of angels also. For that He who commanded us to love
our neighbor made no exception, as far as men are concerned, is shown both by our Lord
Himself in the Gospel, and by the Apostle Paul. For when the man to whom our Lord delivered
those two commandments, and to whom He said that on these hang all the law and
the prophets, asked Him, “And who is my neighbor?” He told him of a certain man who,
going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, fell among thieves, and was severely wounded by
them, and left naked and half dead.1739 And He showed him that nobody was neighbor to
this man except him who took pity upon him and came forward to relieve and care for him.
And the man who had asked the question admitted the truth of this when he was himself
interrogated in turn. To whom our Lord says, “Go and do thou likewise;” teaching us that
he is our neighbor whom it is our duty to help in his need, or whom it would be our duty
to help if he were in need. Whence it follows, that he whose duty it would be in turn to help
us is our neighbor. For the name “neighbor” is a relative one, and no one can be neighbor
except to a neighbor. And, again, who does not see that no exception is made of any one
as a person to whom the offices of mercy may be denied when our Lord extends the rule
even to our enemies? “Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you.”1740</p>
<p>32. And so also the Apostle Paul teaches when he says: “For this, Thou shall not commit
adultery, Thou shall not kill, Thou shall not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
saying, namely, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor.”
1741 Whoever then supposes that the apostle did not embrace every man in this precept,
is compelled to admit, what is at once most absurd and most pernicious, that the apostle
thought it no sin, if a man were not a Christian or were an enemy, to commit adultery with
his wife, or to kill him, or to covet his goods. And as nobody but a fool would say this, it is
clear that every man is to be considered our neighbor, because we are to work no ill to any
man.</p>
<p>33. But now, if every one to whom we ought to show, or who ought to show to us, the
offices of mercy is by right called a neighbor, it is manifest that the command to love our
neighbor embraces the holy angels also, seeing that so great offices of mercy have been

<pb n="1194"/>
performed by them on our behalf, as may easily be shown by turning the attention to many
passages of Holy Scripture. And on this ground even God Himself, our Lord, desired to be
called our neighbor. For our Lord Jesus Christ points to Himself under the figure of the
man who brought aid to him who was lying half dead on the road, wounded and abandoned
by the robbers. And the Psalmist says in his prayer, “I behaved myself as though he had
been my friend or brother.”1742 But as the Divine nature is of higher excellence than, and
far removed above, our nature, the command to love God is distinct from that to love our
neighbor. For He shows us pity on account of His own goodness, but we show pity to one
another on account of His;—that is, He pities us that we may fully enjoy Himself; we pity
one another that we may fully enjoy Him.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—God Uses Rather Than Enjoys Us.</head>
<p>34. And on this ground, when we say that we enjoy only that which we love for its own
sake, and that nothing is a true object of enjoyment except that which makes us happy, and
that all other things are for use, there seems still to be something that requires explanation.
For God loves us, and Holy Scripture frequently sets before us the love He has towards us.
In what way then does He love us? As objects of use or as objects of enjoyment? If He enjoys
us, He must be in need of good from us, and no sane man will say that; for all the good we
enjoy is either Himself, or what comes from Himself. And no one can be ignorant or in
doubt as to the fact that the light stands in no need of the glitter of the things it has itself lit
up. The Psalmist says most plainly, “I said to the Lord, Thou art my God, for Thou needest
not my goodness.”1743 He does not enjoy us then, but makes use of us. For if He neither
enjoys nor uses us, I am at a loss to discover in what way He can love us.</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—In What Way God Uses Man.</head>
<p>35. But neither does He use after our fashion of using. For when we use objects, we do
so with a view to the full enjoyment of the goodness of God. God, however, in His use of
us, has reference to His own goodness. For it is because He is good we exist; and so far as
we truly exist we are good. And, further, because He is also just, we cannot with impunity
be evil; and so far as we are evil, so far is our existence less complete. Now He is the first
and supreme existence, who is altogether unchangeable, and who could say in the fullest
sense of the words, “I AM That I AM,” and “Thou shalt say to them, I AM hath sent me
unto you;”1744 so that all other things that exist, both owe their existence entirely to Him,
and are good only so far as He has given it to them to be so. That use, then, which God is
said to make of us has no reference to His own advantage, but to ours only; and, so far as
He is concerned, has reference only to His goodness. When we take pity upon a man and
care for him, it is for his advantage we do so; but somehow or other our own advantage
follows by a sort of natural consequence, for God does not leave the mercy we show to him
who needs it to go without reward. Now this is our highest reward, that we should fully
enjoy Him, and that all who enjoy Him should enjoy one another in Him.</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—In What Way Man Should Be Enjoyed.</head>
<p>36. For if we find our happiness complete in one another, we stop short upon the road,
and place our hope of happiness in man or angel. Now the proud man and the proud angel
arrogate this to themselves, and are glad to have the hope of others fixed upon them. But,
on the contrary, the holy man and the holy angel, even when we are weary and anxious to
stay with them and rest in them, set themselves to recruit our energies with the provision
which they have received of God for us or for themselves; and then urge us thus refreshed
to go on our way towards Him, in the enjoyment of whom we find our common happiness.
For even the apostle exclaims, “Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name
of Paul?”1745 and again: “Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but
God that giveth the increase.”1746 And the angel admonisheth the man who is about to
worship him, that he should rather worship Him who is his Master, and under whom he
himself is a fellow-servant.1747</p>
<p>37. But when you have joy of a man in God, it is God rather than man that you enjoy.
For you enjoy Him by whom you are made happy, and you rejoice to have come to Him in
whose presence you place your hope of joy. And accordingly, Paul says to Philemon, “Yea,
brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord.”1748 For if he had not added “in the Lord,” but
had only said, “Let me have joy of thee,” he would have implied that he fixed his hope of
happiness upon him, although even in the immediate context to “enjoy” is used in the sense
of to “use with delight.” For when the thing that we love is near us, it is a matter of course
that it should bring delight with it. And if you pass beyond this delight, and make it a means
to that which you are permanently to rest in, you are using it, and it is an abuse of language
to say that you enjoy it. But if you cling to it, and rest in it, finding your happiness complete
in it, then you may be truly and properly said to enjoy it. And this we must never do except
in the case of the Blessed Trinity, who is the Supreme and Unchangeable Good.</p>

<p>38. And mark that even when He who is Himself the Truth and the Word, by whom
all things were made, had been made flesh that He might dwell among us, the apostle yet
says: “Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him
no more.”1749 For Christ, desiring not only to give the possession to those who had completed
the journey, but also to be Himself the way to those who were just setting out, determined
to take a fleshly body. Whence also that expression, “The Lord created1750 me in the
beginning of His way,”1751 that is, that those who wished to come might begin their journey
in Him. The apostle, therefore, although still on the way, and following after God who called
him to the reward of His heavenly calling, yet forgetting those things which were behind,
and pressing on towards those things which were before,1752 had already passed over the
beginning of the way, and had now no further need of it; yet by this way all must commence
their journey who desire to attain to the truth, and to rest in eternal life. For He says: “I
am the way, and the truth, and the life;”1753 that is, by me men come, to me they come, in
me they rest. For when we come to Him, we come to the Father also, because through an
equal an equal is known; and the Holy Spirit binds, and as it were seals us, so that we are
able to rest permanently in the supreme and unchangeable Good. And hence we may learn
how essential it is that nothing should detain us on the way, when not even our Lord Himself,
so far as He has condescended to be our way, is willing to detain us, but wishes us rather to
press on; and, instead of weakly clinging to temporal things, even though these have been
put on and worn by Him for our salvation, to pass over them quickly, and to struggle to attain
unto Himself, who has freed our nature from the bondage of temporal things, and has set
it down at the right hand of His Father.</p>

Law, and of all Holy Scripture, is the love of an object which is to be enjoyed, and the love
of an object which can enjoy that other in fellowship with ourselves. For there is no need
of a command that each man should love himself. The whole temporal dispensation for
our salvation, therefore, was framed by the providence of God that we might know this truth
and be able to act upon it; and we ought to use that dispensation, not with such love and
delight as if it were a good to rest in, but with a transient feeling rather, such as we have towards
the road, or carriages, or other things that are merely means. Perhaps some other
comparison can be found that will more suitably express the idea that we are to love the
things by which we are borne only for the sake of that towards which we are borne.</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—That Interpretation of Scripture Which Builds Us Up in Love is Not
Perniciously Deceptive Nor Mendacious, Even Though It Be Faulty. The Interpreter,
However, Should Be Corrected.</head>
<p>40. Whoever, then, thinks that he understands the Holy Scriptures, or any part of them,
but puts such an interpretation upon them as does not tend to build up this twofold love of
God and our neighbor, does not yet understand them as he ought. If, on the other hand, a
man draws a meaning from them that may be used for the building up of love, even though
he does not happen upon the precise meaning which the author whom he reads intended
to express in that place, his error is not pernicious, and he is wholly clear from the charge
of deception. For there is involved in deception the intention to say what is false; and we
find plenty of people who intend to deceive, but nobody who wishes to be deceived. Since,
then, the man who knows practises deceit, and the ignorant man is practised upon, it is
quite clear that in any particular case the man who is deceived is a better man than he who
deceives, seeing that it is better to suffer than to commit injustice. Now every man who lies
commits an injustice; and if any man thinks that a lie is ever useful, he must think that injustice
is sometimes useful. For no liar keeps faith in the matter about which he lies. He
wishes, of course, that the man to whom he lies should place confidence in him; and yet he
betrays his confidence by lying to him. Now every man who breaks faith is unjust. Either,
then, injustice is sometimes useful (which is impossible), or a lie is never useful.</p>
<p>41. Whoever takes another meaning out of Scripture than the writer intended, goes
astray, but not through any falsehood in Scripture. Nevertheless, as I was going to say, if
his mistaken interpretation tends to build up love, which is the end of the commandment,
he goes astray in much the same way as a man who by mistake quits the high road, but yet
reaches through the fields the same place to which the road leads. He is to be corrected,
however, and to be shown how much better it is not to quit the straight road, lest, if he get
into a habit of going astray, he may sometimes take cross roads, or even go in the wrong
direction altogether.</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—Dangers of Mistaken Interpretation.</head>
<p>For if he takes up rashly a meaning which the author whom he is reading did not intend,
he often falls in with other statements which he cannot harmonize with this meaning. And
if he admits that these statements are true and certain, then it follows that the meaning he
had put upon the former passage cannot be the true one: and so it comes to pass, one can
hardly tell how, that, out of love for his own opinion, he begins to feel more angry with
Scripture than he is with himself. And if he should once permit that evil to creep in, it will
utterly destroy him. “For we walk by faith, not by sight.”1754 Now faith will totter if the
authority of Scripture begin to shake. And then, if faith totter, love itself will grow cold.
For if a man has fallen from faith, he must necessarily also fall from love; for he cannot love
what he does not believe to exist. But if he both believes and loves, then through good works,
and through diligent attention to the precepts of morality, he comes to hope also that he
shall attain the object of his love. And so these are the three things to which all knowledge
and all prophecy are subservient: faith, hope, love.</p>

<head>Chapter 38.—Love Never Faileth.</head>
<p>42. But sight shall displace faith; and hope shall be swallowed up in that perfect bliss
to which we shall come: love, on the other hand, shall wax greater when these others fail.
For if we love by faith that which as yet we see not, how much more shall we love it when
we begin to see! And if we love by hope that which as yet we have not reached, how much
more shall we love it when we reach it! For there is this great difference between things
temporal and things eternal, that a temporal object is valued more before we possess it, and
begins to prove worthless the moment we attain it, because it does not satisfy the soul, which
has its only true and sure resting-place in eternity: an eternal object, on the other hand, is
loved with greater ardor when it is in possession than while it is still an object of desire, for
no one in his longing for it can set a higher value on it than really belongs to it, so as to think
it comparatively worthless when he finds it of less value than he thought; on the contrary,
however high the value any man may set upon it when he is on his way to possess it, he will
find it, when it comes into his possession, of higher value still.</p>

<head>Chapter 39.—He Who is Mature in Faith, Hope and Love, Needs Scripture No
Longer.</head>
<p>43. And thus a man who is resting upon faith, hope and love, and who keeps a firm
hold upon these, does not need the Scriptures except for the purpose of instructing others.
Accordingly, many live without copies of the Scriptures, even in solitude, on the strength
of these three graces. So that in their case, I think, the saying is already fulfilled: “Whether
there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there
be knowledge, it shall vanish away.”1755 Yet by means of these instruments (as they may
be called), so great an edifice of faith and love has been built up in them, that, holding to
what is perfect, they do not seek for what is only in part perfect—of course, I mean, so far
as is possible in this life; for, in comparison with the future life, the life of no just and holy
man is perfect here. Therefore the apostle says: “Now abideth faith, hope, charity, these
three; but the greatest of these is charity:”1756 because, when a man shall have reached the
eternal world, while the other two graces will fail, love will remain greater and more assured.</p>

<head>Chapter 40.—What Manner of Reader Scripture Demands.</head>
<p>44. And, therefore, if a man fully understands that “the end of the commandment is
charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,”1757 and is
bent upon making all his understanding of Scripture to bear upon these three graces, he
may come to the interpretation of these books with an easy mind. For while the apostle
says “love,” he adds “out of a pure heart,” to provide against anything being loved but that
which is worthy of love. And he joins with this “a good conscience,” in reference to hope;
for, if a man has the burthen of a bad conscience, he despairs of ever reaching that which
he believes in and loves. And in the third place he says: “and of faith unfeigned.” For if
our faith is free from all hypocrisy, then we both abstain from loving what is unworthy of
our love, and by living uprightly we are able to indulge the hope that our hope shall not be
in vain.</p>
<p>For these reasons I have been anxious to speak about the objects of faith, as far as I
thought it necessary for my present purpose; for much has already been said on this subject
in other volumes, either by others or by myself. And so let this be the end of the present
book. In the next I shall discuss, as far as God shall give me light, the subject of signs.</p>

<head>Book II.</head>
<p>Argument—Having completed his exposition of things, the author now proceeds to discuss
the subject of signs. He first defines what a sign is, and shows that there are two classes of
signs, the natural and the conventional. Of conventional signs (which are the only class here
noticed), words are the most numerous and important, and are those with which the interpreter
of Scripture is chiefly concerned. The difficulties and obscurities of Scripture spring chiefly
from two sources, unknown and ambiguous signs. The present book deals only with unknown
signs, the ambiguities of language being reserved for treatment in the next book. The difficulty
arising from ignorance of signs is to be removed by learning the Greek and Hebrew languages,
in which Scripture is written, by comparing the various translations, and by attending to the
context. In the interpretation of figurative expressions, knowledge of things is as necessary as
knowledge of words; and the various sciences and arts of the heathen, so far as they are true
and useful, may be turned to account in removing our ignorance of signs, whether these be
direct or figurative. Whilst exposing the folly and futility of many heathen superstitions and
practices, the author points out how all that is sound and useful in their science and philosophy
may be turned to a Christian use. And in conclusion, he shows the spirit in which it behoves
us to address ourselves to the study and interpretation of the sacred books.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="1206"/>
<head>Chapter 1.—Signs, Their Nature and Variety.</head>
<p>1. As when I was writing about things, I introduced the subject with a warning against
attending to anything but what they are in themselves,1758 even though they are signs of
something else, so now, when I come in its turn to discuss the subject of signs, I lay down
this direction, not to attend to what they are in themselves, but to the fact that they are signs,
that is, to what they signify. For a sign is a thing which, over and above the impression it
makes on the senses, causes something else to come into the mind as a consequence of itself:
as when we see a footprint, we conclude that an animal whose footprint this is has passed
by; and when we see smoke, we know that there is fire beneath; and when we hear the voice
of a living man, we think of the feeling in his mind; and when the trumpet sounds, soldiers
know that they are to advance or retreat, or do whatever else the state of the battle requires.</p>
<p>2. Now some signs are natural, others conventional. Natural signs are those which,
apart from any intention or desire of using them as signs, do yet lead to the knowledge of
something else, as, for example, smoke when it indicates fire. For it is not from any intention
of making it a sign that it is so, but through attention to experience we come to know that
fire is beneath, even when nothing but smoke can be seen. And the footprint of an animal
passing by belongs to this class of signs. And the countenance of an angry or sorrowful man
indicates the feeling in his mind, independently of his will: and in the same way every other
emotion of the mind is betrayed by the tell-tale countenance, even though we do nothing
with the intention of making it known. This class of signs, however, it is no part of my
design to discuss at present. But as it comes under this division of the subject, I could not
altogether pass it over. It will be enough to have noticed it thus far.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="1207"/>
<head>Chapter 2.—Of the Kind of Signs We are Now Concerned with.</head>
<p>3. Conventional signs, on the other hand, are those which living beings mutually exchange
for the purpose of showing, as well as they can, the feelings of their minds, or their
perceptions, or their thoughts. Nor is there any reason for giving a sign except the desire
of drawing forth and conveying into another’s mind what the giver of the sign has in his
own mind. We wish, then, to consider and discuss this class of signs so far as men are
concerned with it, because even the signs which have been given us of God, and which are
contained in the Holy Scriptures, were made known to us through men—those, namely,
who wrote the Scriptures. The beasts, too, have certain signs among themselves by which
they make known the desires in their mind. For when the poultry-cock has discovered food,
he signals with his voice for the hen to run to him, and the dove by cooing calls his mate,
or is called by her in turn; and many signs of the same kind are matters of common observation.
Now whether these signs, like the expression or the cry of a man in grief, follow the
movement of the mind instinctively and apart from any purpose, or whether they are really
used with the purpose of signification, is another question, and does not pertain to the
matter in hand. And this part of the subject I exclude from the scope of this work as not
necessary to my present object.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="1208"/>
<head>Chapter 3.—Among Signs, Words Hold the Chief Place.</head>
<p>4. Of the signs, then, by which men communicate their thoughts to one another, some
relate to the sense of sight, some to that of hearing, a very few to the other senses. For, when
we nod, we give no sign except to the eyes of the man to whom we wish by this sign to impart
our desire. And some convey a great deal by the motion of the hands: and actors by
movements of all their limbs give certain signs to the initiated, and, so to speak, address
their conversation to the eyes: and the military standards and flags convey through the eyes
the will of the commanders. And all these signs are as it were a kind of visible words. The
signs that address themselves to the ear are, as I have said, more numerous, and for the most
part consist of words. For though the bugle and the flute and the lyre frequently give not
only a sweet but a significant sound, yet all these signs are very few in number compared
with words. For among men words have obtained far and away the chief place as a means
of indicating the thoughts of the mind. Our Lord, it is true, gave a sign through the odor
of the ointment which was poured out upon His feet;1759 and in the sacrament of His body
and blood He signified His will through the sense of taste; and when by touching the hem
of His garment the woman was made whole, the act was not wanting in significance.1760
But the countless multitude of the signs through which men express their thoughts consist
of words. For I have been able to put into words all those signs, the various classes of which
I have briefly touched upon, but I could by no effort express words in terms of those signs.</p>

<p>5. But because words pass away as soon as they strike upon the air, and last no longer
than their sound, men have by means of letters formed signs of words. Thus the sounds of
the voice are made visible to the eye, not of course as sounds, but by means of certain signs.
It has been found impossible, however, to make those signs common to all nations owing
to the sin of discord among men, which springs from every man trying to snatch the chief
place for himself. And that celebrated tower which was built to reach to heaven was an indication
of this arrogance of spirit; and the ungodly men concerned in it justly earned the
punishment of having not their minds only, but their tongues besides, thrown into confusion
and discordance.1761</p>

it could at the fit season be disseminated through the whole world, was interpreted into
various tongues, and spread far and wide, and thus became known to the nations for their
salvation. And in reading it, men seek nothing more than to find out the thought and will
of those by whom it was written, and through these to find out the will of God, in accordance
with which they believe these men to have spoken.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Use of the Obscurities in Scripture Which Arise from Its Figurative
Language.</head>
<p>7. But hasty and careless readers are led astray by many and manifold obscurities and
ambiguities, substituting one meaning for another; and in some places they cannot hit upon
even a fair interpretation. Some of the expressions are so obscure as to shroud the meaning
in the thickest darkness. And I do not doubt that all this was divinely arranged for the
purpose of subduing pride by toil, and of preventing a feeling of satiety in the intellect, which
generally holds in small esteem what is discovered without difficulty. For why is it, I ask,
that if any one says that there are holy and just men whose life and conversation the Church
of Christ uses as a means of redeeming those who come to it from all kinds of superstitions,
and making them through their imitation of good men members of its own body; men who,
as good and true servants of God, have come to the baptismal font laying down the burdens
of the world, and who rising thence do, through the implanting of the Holy Spirit, yield the
fruit of a two-fold love, a love, that is, of God and their neighbor;—how is it, I say, that if a
man says this, he does not please his hearer so much as when he draws the same meaning
from that passage in Canticles, where it is said of the Church, when it is being praised under
the figure of a beautiful woman, “Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are shorn which
came up from the washing, whereof every one bears twins, and none is barren among
them?”1762 Does the hearer learn anything more than when he listens to the same thought
expressed in the plainest language, without the help of this figure? And yet, I don’t know
why, I feel greater pleasure in contemplating holy men, when I view them as the teeth of
the Church, tearing men away from their errors, and bringing them into the Church’s body,
with all their harshness softened down, just as if they had been torn off and masticated by
the teeth. It is with the greatest pleasure, too, that I recognize them under the figure of sheep
that have been shorn, laying down the burthens of the world like fleeces, and coming up
from the washing, i.e., from baptism, and all bearing twins, i.e., the twin commandments
of love, and none among them barren in that holy fruit.</p>
<p>8. But why I view them with greater delight under that aspect than if no such figure
were drawn from the sacred books, though the fact would remain the same and the knowledge
the same, is another question, and one very difficult to answer. Nobody, however, has any
doubt about the facts, both that it is pleasanter in some cases to have knowledge communicated
through figures, and that what is attended with difficulty in the seeking gives greater
pleasure in the finding.—For those who seek but do not find suffer from hunger. Those,
again, who do not seek at all because they have what they require just beside them often
grow languid from satiety. Now weakness from either of these causes is to be avoided.
Accordingly the Holy Spirit has, with admirable wisdom and care for our welfare, so arranged
<note type="footnote">1762 Cant. iv. 2.</note>

<pb n="1212"/>
the Holy Scriptures as by the plainer passages to satisfy our hunger, and by the more obscure
to stimulate our appetite. For almost nothing is dug out of those obscure passages which
may not be found set forth in the plainest language elsewhere.</p>

<pb n="1213"/>
<head>Chapter 7.—Steps to Wisdom: First, Fear; Second, Piety; Third, Knowledge; Fourth,
Resolution; Fifth, Counsel; Sixth, Purification of Heart; Seventh, Stop or Termination,
Wisdom.</head>
<p>9. First of all, then, it is necessary that we should be led by the fear of God to seek the
knowledge of His will, what He commands us to desire and what to avoid. Now this fear
will of necessity excite in us the thought of our mortality and of the death that is before us,
and crucify all the motions of pride as if our flesh were nailed to the tree. Next it is necessary
to have our hearts subdued by piety, and not to run in the face of Holy Scripture, whether
when understood it strikes at some of our sins, or, when not understood, we feel as if we
could be wiser and give better commands ourselves. We must rather think and believe that
whatever is there written, even though it be hidden, is better and truer than anything we
could devise by our own wisdom.</p>
<p>10. After these two steps of fear and piety, we come to the third step, knowledge, of
which I have now undertaken to treat. For in this every earnest student of the Holy Scriptures
exercises himself, to find nothing else in them but that God is to be loved for His own sake,
and our neighbor for God’s sake; and that God is to be loved with all the heart, and with all
the soul, and with all the mind, and one’s neighbor as one’s self—that is, in such a way that
all our love for our neighbor, like all our love for ourselves, should have reference to God.1763
And on these two commandments I touched in the previous book when I was treating
about things.1764 It is necessary, then, that each man should first of all find in the Scriptures
that he, through being entangled in the love of this world—i.e., of temporal things—has
been drawn far away from such a love for God and such a love for his neighbor as Scripture
enjoins. Then that fear which leads him to think of the judgment of God, and that piety
which gives him no option but to believe in and submit to the authority of Scripture, compel
him to bewail his condition. For the knowledge of a good hope makes a man not boastful,
but sorrowful. And in this frame of mind he implores with unremitting prayers the comfort
of the Divine help that he may not be overwhelmed in despair, and so he gradually comes
to the fourth step,—that is, strength and resolution,1765—in which he hungers and thirsts
after righteousness. For in this frame of mind he extricates himself from every form of fatal
joy in transitory things, and turning away from these, fixes his affection on things eternal,
to wit, the unchangeable Trinity in unity.</p>
<p>11. And when, to the extent of his power, he has gazed upon this object shining from
afar, and has felt that owing to the weakness of his sight he cannot endure that matchless
<note type="footnote">1763 Comp. Matt. xxii. 37–40.</note>

<pb n="1214"/>
light, then in the fifth step—that is, in the counsel of compassion1766—he cleanses his soul,
which is violently agitated, and disturbs him with base desires, from the filth it has contracted.
And at this stage he exercises himself diligently in the love of his neighbor; and when he
has reached the point of loving his enemy, full of hopes and unbroken in strength, he mounts
to the sixth step, in which he purifies the eye itself which can see God,1767 so far as God can
be seen by those who as far as possible die to this world. For men see Him just so far as they
die to this world; and so far as they live to it they see Him not. But yet, although that light
may begin to appear clearer, and not only more tolerable, but even more delightful, still it
is only through a glass darkly that we are said to see, because we walk by faith, not by sight,
while we continue to wander as strangers in this world, even though our conversation be
in heaven.1768 And at this stage, too, a man so purges the eye of his affections as not to
place his neighbor before, or even in comparison with, the truth, and therefore not himself,
because not him whom he loves as himself. Accordingly, that holy man will be so single
and so pure in heart, that he will not step aside from the truth, either for the sake of pleasing
men or with a view to avoid any of the annoyances which beset this life. Such a son ascends
to wisdom, which is the seventh and last step, and which he enjoys in peace and tranquillity.
For the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.1769 From that beginning, then, till we reach
wisdom itself, our way is by the steps now described.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—The Canonical Books.</head>
<p>12. But let us now go back to consider the third step here mentioned, for it is about it
that I have set myself to speak and reason as the Lord shall grant me wisdom. The most
skillful interpreter of the sacred writings, then, will be he who in the first place has read
them all and retained them in his knowledge, if not yet with full understanding, still with
such knowledge as reading gives,—those of them, at least, that are called canonical. For he
will read the others with greater safety when built up in the belief of the truth, so that they
will not take first possession of a weak mind, nor, cheating it with dangerous falsehoods
and delusions, fill it with prejudices adverse to a sound understanding. Now, in regard to
the canonical Scriptures, he must follow the judgment of the greater number of catholic
churches; and among these, of course, a high place must be given to such as have been
thought worthy to be the seat of an apostle and to receive epistles. Accordingly, among the
canonical Scriptures he will judge according to the following standard: to prefer those that
are received by all the catholic churches to those which some do not receive. Among those,
again, which are not received by all, he will prefer such as have the sanction of the greater
number and those of greater authority, to such as are held by the smaller number and those
of less authority. If, however, he shall find that some books are held by the greater number
of churches, and others by the churches of greater authority (though this is not a very likely
thing to happen), I think that in such a case the authority on the two sides is to be looked
upon as equal.</p>
<p>13. Now the whole canon of Scripture on which we say this judgment is to be exercised,
is contained in the following books:—Five books of Moses, that is, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronomy; one book of Joshua the son of Nun; one of Judges; one short
book called Ruth, which seems rather to belong to the beginning of Kings; next, four books
of Kings, and two of Chronicles—these last not following one another, but running parallel,
so to speak, and going over the same ground. The books now mentioned are history, which
contains a connected narrative of the times, and follows the order of the events. There are
other books which seem to follow no regular order, and are connected neither with the order
of the preceding books nor with one another, such as Job, and Tobias, and Esther, and Judith,
and the two books of Maccabees, and the two of Ezra,1770 which last look more like a sequel
to the continuous regular history which terminates with the books of Kings and Chronicles.
Next are the Prophets, in which there is one book of the Psalms of David; and three books
of Solomon, viz., Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. For two books, one called
Wisdom and the other Ecclesiasticus, are ascribed to Solomon from a certain resemblance
of style, but the most likely opinion is that they were written by Jesus the son of Sirach.1771
<note type="footnote">1770 That is, Ezra and Nehemiah.</note>
<note type="footnote">1771 Augustin in his Retractations withdrew this opinion so far as regards the book of Wisdom.</note>

<pb n="1216"/>
Still they are to be reckoned among the prophetical books, since they have attained recognition
as being authoritative. The remainder are the books which are strictly called the
Prophets: twelve separate books of the prophets which are connected with one another,
and having never been disjoined, are reckoned as one book; the names of these prophets
are as follows:—Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah,
Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; then there are the four greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Daniel, Ezekiel. The authority of the Old Testament1772 is contained within the limits of
these forty-four books. That of the New Testament, again, is contained within the following:—
Four books of the Gospel, according to Matthew, according to Mark, according to
Luke, according to John; fourteen epistles of the Apostle Paul—one to the Romans, two to
the Corinthians, one to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, two to the
Thessalonians, one to the Colossians, two to Timothy, one to Titus, to Philemon, to the

<head>Chapter 9.—How We Should Proceed in Studying Scripture.</head>
<p>14. In all these books those who fear God and are of a meek and pious disposition seek
the will of God. And in pursuing this search the first rule to be observed is, as I said, to
know these books, if not yet with the understanding, still to read them so as to commit them
to memory, or at least so as not to remain wholly ignorant of them. Next, those matters
that are plainly laid down in them, whether rules of life or rules of faith, are to be searched
into more carefully and more diligently; and the more of these a man discovers, the more
capacious does his understanding become. For among the things that are plainly laid down
in Scripture are to be found all matters that concern faith and the manner of life,—to wit,
hope and love, of which I have spoken in the previous book. After this, when we have made
ourselves to a certain extent familiar with the language of Scripture, we may proceed to open
up and investigate the obscure passages, and in doing so draw examples from the plainer
expressions to throw light upon the more obscure, and use the evidence of passages about
which there is no doubt to remove all hesitation in regard to the doubtful passages. And in
this matter memory counts for a great deal; but if the memory be defective, no rules can
supply the want.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—Unknown or Ambiguous Signs Prevent Scripture from Being Understood.</head>
<p>15. Now there are two causes which prevent what is written from being understood:
its being vailed either under unknown, or under ambiguous signs. Signs are either proper
or figurative. They are called proper when they are used to point out the objects they were
designed to point out, as we say bos when we mean an ox, because all men who with us use
the Latin tongue call it by this name. Signs are figurative when the things themselves which
we indicate by the proper names are used to signify something else, as we say bos, and understand
by that syllable the ox, which is ordinarily called by that name; but then further
by that ox understand a preacher of the gospel, as Scripture signifies, according to the
apostle’s explanation, when it says: “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the
corn.”1773</p>

<pb n="1219"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—Knowledge of Languages, Especially of Greek and Hebrew, Necessary
to Remove Ignorance or Signs.</head>
<p>16. The great remedy for ignorance of proper signs is knowledge of languages. And
men who speak the Latin tongue, of whom are those I have undertaken to instruct, need
two other languages for the knowledge of Scripture, Hebrew and Greek, that they may have
recourse to the original texts if the endless diversity of the Latin translators throw them into
doubt. Although, indeed, we often find Hebrew words untranslated in the books as for example,
Amen, Halleluia, Racha, Hosanna, and others of the same kind. Some of these, although
they could have been translated, have been preserved in their original form on account
of the more sacred authority that attaches to it, as for example, Amen and Halleluia. Some
of them, again, are said to be untranslatable into another tongue, of which the other two I
have mentioned are examples. For in some languages there are words that cannot be
translated into the idiom of another language. And this happens chiefly in the case of interjections,
which are words that express rather an emotion of the mind than any part of a
thought we have in our mind. And the two given above are said to be of this kind, Racha
expressing the cry of an angry man, Hosanna that of a joyful man. But the knowledge of
these languages is necessary, not for the sake of a few words like these which it is very easy
to mark and to ask about, but, as has been said, on account of the diversities among translators.
For the translations of the Scriptures from Hebrew into Greek can be counted, but
the Latin translators are out of all number. For in the early days of the faith every man who
happened to get his hands upon a Greek manuscript, and who thought he had any knowledge,
were it ever so little, of the two languages, ventured upon the work of translation.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="1220"/>
<head>Chapter 12.—A Diversity of Interpretations is Useful. Errors Arising from Ambiguous
Words.</head>
<p>17. And this circumstance would assist rather than hinder the understanding of Scripture,
if only readers were not careless. For the examination of a number of texts has often
thrown light upon some of the more obscure passages; for example, in that passage of the
prophet Isaiah,1774 one translator reads: “And do not despise the domestics of thy seed;”1775
another reads: “And do not despise thine own flesh.”1776 Each of these in turn confirms
the other. For the one is explained by the other; because “flesh” may be taken in its literal
sense, so that a man may understand that he is admonished not to despise his own body;
and “the domestics of thy seed” may be understood figuratively of Christians, because they
are spiritually born of the same seed as ourselves, namely, the Word. When now the
meaning of the two translators is compared, a more likely sense of the words suggests itself,
viz., that the command is not to despise our kinsmen, because when one brings the expression
“domestics of thy seed” into relation with “flesh,” kinsmen most naturally occur to one’s
mind. Whence, I think, that expression of the apostle, when he says, “If by any means I may
provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them;”1777 that is,
that through emulation of those who had believed, some of them might believe too. And
he calls the Jews his “flesh,” on account of the relationship of blood. Again, that passage
from the same prophet Isaiah:1778 “If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand,”1779 another
has translated: “If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.”1780 Now which of these is
the literal translation cannot be ascertained without reference to the text in the original
tongue. And yet to those who read with knowledge, a great truth is to be found in each.
For it is difficult for interpreters to differ so widely as not to touch at some point. Accordingly
here, as understanding consists in sight, and is abiding, but faith feeds us as babes, upon
milk, in the cradles of temporal things (for now we walk by faith, not by sight);1781 as,
moreover, unless we walk by faith, we shall not attain to sight, which does not pass away,
but abides, our understanding being purified by holding to the truth;—for these reasons
one says, “If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand;” but the other, “If ye will not believe,
ye shall not abide.”</p>

<pb n="1221"/>
<p>18. And very often a translator, to whom the meaning is not well known, is deceived
by an ambiguity in the original language, and puts upon the passage a construction that is
wholly alien to the sense of the writer. As for example, some texts read: “Their feet are
sharp to shed blood;”1782 for the word ὁζύς among the Greeks means both sharp and swift.
And so he saw the true meaning who translated: “Their feet are swift to shed blood.” The
other, taking the wrong sense of an ambiguous word, fell into error. Now translations such
as this are not obscure, but false; and there is a wide difference between the two things. For
we must learn not to interpret, but to correct texts of this sort. For the same reason it is,
that because the Greek word μόσχος means a calf, some have not understood that
μοσχεύματα1783 are shoots of trees, and have translated the word “calves;” and this error
has crept into so many texts, that you can hardly find it written in any other way. And yet
the meaning is very clear; for it is made evident by the words that follow. For “the plantings
of an adulterer will not take deep root,”1784 is a more suitable form of expression than the
“calves;”1785 because these walk upon the ground with their feet, and are not fixed in the
earth by roots. In this passage, indeed, the rest of the context also justifies this translation.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—How Faulty Interpretations Can Be Emended.</head>
<p>19. But since we do not clearly see what the actual thought is which the several translators
endeavor to express, each according to his own ability and judgment, unless we examine it
in the language which they translate; and since the translator, if he be not a very learned
man, often departs from the meaning of his author, we must either endeavor to get a
knowledge of those languages from which the Scriptures are translated into Latin, or we
must get hold of the translations of those who keep rather close to the letter of the original,
not because these are sufficient, but because we may use them to correct the freedom or the
error of others, who in their translations have chosen to follow the sense quite as much as
the words. For not only single words, but often whole phrases are translated, which could
not be translated at all into the Latin idiom by any one who wished to hold by the usage of
the ancients who spoke Latin. And though these sometimes do not interfere with the understanding
of the passage, yet they are offensive to those who feel greater delight in things
when even the signs of those things are kept in their own purity. For what is called a solecism
is nothing else than the putting of words together according to a different rule from that
which those of our predecessors who spoke with any authority followed. For whether we
say inter homines (among men) or inter hominibus, is of no consequence to a man who only
wishes to know the facts. And in the same way, what is a barbarism but the pronouncing
of a word in a different way from that in which those who spoke Latin before us pronounced
it? For whether the word ignoscere (to pardon) should be pronounced with the third syllable
long or short, is not a matter of much concern to the man who is beseeching God, in any
way at all that he can get the words out, to pardon his sins. What then is purity of speech,
except the preserving of the custom of language established by the authority of former
speakers?</p>
<p>20. And men are easily offended in a matter of this kind, just in proportion as they are
weak; and they are weak just in proportion as they wish to seem learned, not in the knowledge
of things which tend to edification, but in that of signs, by which it is hard not to be puffed
up,1786 seeing that the knowledge of things even would often set up our neck, if it were not
held down by the yoke of our Master. For how does it prevent our understanding it to have
the following passage thus expressed: “Quæ est terra in quo isti insidunt super eam, si bona
est an nequam; et quæ sunt civitates, in quibus ipsi inhabitant in ipsis?”1787 And I am more
disposed to think that this is simply the idiom of another language than that any deeper
meaning is intended. Again, that phrase, which we cannot now take away from the lips of
<note type="footnote">1786 Comp. 1 Cor. viii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">1787 “And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they
dwell in.”— Num. xiii.19 (A.V.).</note>

<pb n="1223"/>
the people who sing it: “Super ipsum autem floriet sanctificatio mea,”1788 surely takes away
nothing from the meaning. Yet a more learned man would prefer that this should be corrected,
and that we should say, not floriet, but florebit. Nor does anything stand in the way
of the correction being made, except the usage of the singers. Mistakes of this kind, then,
if a man do not choose to avoid them altogether, it is easy to treat with indifference, as not
interfering with a right understanding. But take, on the other hand, the saying of the apostle:
“Quod stultum est Dei, sapientius est hominibus, et quod infirmum est Dei, fortius est hominibus.”
1789 If any one should retain in this passage the Greek idiom, and say, “Quod stultum
est Dei, sapientius est hominum et quod infirmum est Dei fortius est hominum,”1790 a quick
and careful reader would indeed by an effort attain to the true meaning, but still a man of
slower intelligence either would not understand it at all, or would put an utterly false con-
struction upon it. For not only is such a form of speech faulty in the Latin tongue, but it is
ambiguous too, as if the meaning might be, that the folly of men or the weakness of men is
wiser or stronger than that of God. But indeed even the expression sapientius est hominibus
(stronger than men) is not free from ambiguity, even though it be free from solecism. For
whether hominibus is put as the plural of the dative or as the plural of the ablative, does not
appear, unless by reference to the meaning. It would be better then to say, sapientius est
quam homines, and fortius est quam homines.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—How the Meaning of Unknown Words and Idioms is to Be Discovered.</head>
<p>21. About ambiguous signs, however, I shall speak afterwards. I am treating at present
of unknown signs, of which, as far as the words are concerned, there are two kinds. For
either a word or an idiom, of which the reader is ignorant, brings him to a stop. Now if
these belong to foreign tongues, we must either make inquiry about them from men who
speak those tongues, or if we have leisure we must learn the tongues ourselves, or we must
consult and compare several translators. If, however, there are words or idioms in our own
tongue that we are unacquainted with, we gradually come to know them through being accustomed
to read or to hear them. There is nothing that it is better to commit to memory
than those kinds of words and phrases whose meaning we do not know, so that where we
happen to meet either with a more learned man of whom we can inquire, or with a passage
that shows, either by the preceding or succeeding context, or by both, the force and significance
of the phrase we are ignorant of, we can easily by the help of our memory turn our attention
to the matter and learn all about it. So great, however, is the force of custom, even
in regard to learning, that those who have been in a sort of way nurtured and brought up
on the study of Holy Scripture, are surprised at other forms of speech, and think them less
pure Latin than those which they have learnt from Scripture, but which are not to be found
in Latin authors. In this matter, too, the great number of the translators proves a very great
assistance, if they are examined and discussed with a careful comparison of their texts. Only
all positive error must be removed. For those who are anxious to know, the Scriptures ought
in the first place to use their skill in the correction of the texts, so that the uncorrected ones
should give way to the corrected, at least when they are copies of the same translation.</p>

<pb n="1225"/>
<head>Chapter 15.—Among Versions a Preference is Given to the Septuagint and the Itala.</head>
<p>22. Now among translations themselves the Italian (Itala)1791 is to be preferred to the
others, for it keeps closer to the words without prejudice to clearness of expression. And
to correct the Latin we must use the Greek versions, among which the authority of the
Septuagint is pre-eminent as far as the Old Testament is concerned; for it is reported through
all the more learned churches that the seventy translators enjoyed so much of the presence
and power of the Holy Spirit in their work of translation, that among that number of men
there was but one voice. And if, as is reported, and as many not unworthy of confidence
assert,1792 they were separated during the work of translation, each man being in a cell by
himself, and yet nothing was found in the manuscript of any one of them that was not found
in the same words and in the same order of words in all the rest, who dares put anything in
comparison with an authority like this, not to speak of preferring anything to it? And even
if they conferred together with the result that a unanimous agreement sprang out of the
common labor and judgment of them all; even so, it would not be right or becoming for
any one man, whatever his experience, to aspire to correct the unanimous opinion of many
venerable and learned men. Wherefore, even if anything is found in the original Hebrew
in a different form from that in which these men have expressed it, I think we must give
way to the dispensation of Providence which used these men to bring it about, that books
which the Jewish race were unwilling, either from religious scruple or from jealousy, to
make known to other nations, were, with the assistance of the power of King Ptolemy, made
known so long beforehand to the nations which in the future were to believe in the Lord.
And thus it is possible that they translated in such a way as the Holy Spirit, who worked in
them and had given them all one voice, thought most suitable for the Gentiles. But nevertheless,
as I said above, a comparison of those translators also who have kept most closely
to the words, is often not without value as a help to the clearing up of the meaning. The
Latin texts, therefore, of the Old Testament are, as I was about to say, to be corrected if ne-
cessary by the authority of the Greeks, and especially by that of those who, though they
were seventy in number, are said to have translated as with one voice. As to the books of
the New Testament, again, if any perplexity arises from the diversities of the Latin texts, we
must of course yield to the Greek, especially those that are found in the churches of greater
learning and research.</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—The Knowledge Both of Language and Things is Helpful for the Understanding
of Figurative Expressions.</head>
<p>23. In the case of figurative signs, again, if ignorance of any of them should chance to
bring the reader to a stand-still, their meaning is to be traced partly by the knowledge of
languages, partly by the knowledge of things. The pool of Siloam, for example, where the
man whose eyes our Lord had anointed with clay made out of spittle was commanded to
wash, has a figurative significance, and undoubtedly conveys a secret sense; but yet if the
evangelist had not interpreted that name,1793 a meaning so important would lie unnoticed.
And we cannot doubt that, in the same way, many Hebrew names which have not been interpreted
by the writers of those books, would, if any one could interpret them, be of great
value and service in solving the enigmas of Scripture. And a number of men skilled in that
language have conferred no small benefit on posterity by explaining all these words without
reference to their place in Scripture, and telling us what Adam means, what Eve, what Abraham,
what Moses, and also the names of places, what Jerusalem signifies, or Sion, or Sinai,
or Lebanon, or Jordan, and whatever other names in that language we are not acquainted
with. And when these names have been investigated and explained, many figurative expressions
in Scripture become clear.</p>
<p>24. Ignorance of things, too, renders figurative expressions obscure, as when we do not
know the nature of the animals, or minerals, or plants, which are frequently referred to in
Scripture by way of comparison. The fact so well known about the serpent, for example,
that to protect its head it will present its whole body to its assailants—how much light it
throws upon the meaning of our Lord’s command, that we should be wise as serpents;1794
that is to say, that for the sake of our head, which is Christ, we should willingly offer our
body to the persecutors, lest the Christian faith should, as it were, be destroyed in us, if to
save the body we deny our God! Or again, the statement that the serpent gets rid of its old
skin by squeezing itself through a narrow hole, and thus acquires new strength—how appropriately
it fits in with the direction to imitate the wisdom of the serpent, and to put off the
old man, as the apostle says, that we may put on the new;1795 and to put it off, too, by
coming through a narrow place, according to the saying of our Lord, “Enter ye in at the
strait gate!”1796 As, then, knowledge of the nature of the serpent throws light upon many
metaphors which Scripture is accustomed to draw from that animal, so ignorance of other
animals, which are no less frequently mentioned by way of comparison, is a very great
drawback to the reader. And so in regard to minerals and plants: knowledge of the carbuncle,
<note type="footnote">1793 John ix. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">1794 Matt. x. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">1795 Eph. iv. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">1796 Matt. vii. 13.</note>

<pb n="1227"/>
for instance, which shines in the dark, throws light upon many of the dark places in books
too, where it is used metaphorically; and ignorance of the beryl or the adamant often shuts
the doors of knowledge. And the only reason why we find it easy to understand that perpetual
peace is indicated by the olive branch which the dove brought with it when it returned
to the ark,1797 is that we know both that the smooth touch of olive oil is not easily spoiled
by a fluid of another kind, and that the tree itself is an evergreen. Many, again, by reason
of their ignorance of hyssop, not knowing the virtue it has in cleansing the lungs, nor the
power it is said to have of piercing rocks with its roots, although it is a small and insignificant
plant, cannot make out why it is said, “Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.”1798</p>
<p>25. Ignorance of numbers, too, prevents us from understanding things that are set down
in Scripture in a figurative and mystical way. A candid mind, if I may so speak, cannot but
be anxious, for example, to ascertain what is meant by the fact that Moses and Elijah, and
our Lord Himself, all fasted for forty days.1799 And except by knowledge of and reflection
upon the number, the difficulty of explaining the figure involved in this action cannot be
got over. For the number contains ten four times, indicating the knowledge of all things,
and that knowledge interwoven with time. For both the diurnal and the annual revolutions
are accomplished in periods numbering four each; the diurnal in the hours of the morning,
the noontide, the evening, and the night; the annual in the spring, summer, autumn, and
winter months. Now while we live in time, we must abstain and fast from all joy in time,
for the sake of that eternity in which we wish to live; al though by the passage of time we
are taught this very lesson of despising time and seeking eternity. Further, the number ten
signifies the knowledge of the Creator and the creature, for there is a trinity in the Creator;
and the number seven indicates the creature, because of the life and the body. For the life
consists of three parts, whence also God is to be loved with the whole heart, the whole soul,
and the whole mind; and it is very clear that in the body there are four elements of which
it is made up. In this number ten, therefore, when it is placed before us in connection with
time, that is, when it is taken four times we are admonished to live unstained by, and not
partaking of, any delight in time, that is, to fast for forty days. Of this we are admonished
by the law personified in Moses, by prophecy personified in Elijah, and by our Lord Himself,
who, as if receiving the witness both of the law and the prophets, appeared on the mount
between the other two, while His three disciples looked on in amazement. Next, we have
to inquire in the same way, how out of the number forty springs the number fifty, which in
our religion has no ordinary sacredness attached to it on account of the Pentecost, and how
this number taken thrice on account of the three divisions of time, before the law, under
<note type="footnote">1797 Gen. viii. 11.</note>

the law, and under grace, or perhaps on account of the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, and the Trinity itself being added over and above, has reference to the mystery of the
most Holy Church, and reaches to the number of the one hundred and fifty-three fishes
which were taken after the resurrection of our Lord, when the nets were cast out on the
right-hand side of the boat.1800 And in the same way, many other numbers and combinations
of numbers are used in the sacred writings, to convey instruction under a figurative guise,
and ignorance of numbers often shuts out the reader from this instruction.</p>
<p>26. Not a few things, too, are closed against us and obscured by ignorance of music.
One man, for example, has not unskillfully explained some metaphors from the difference
between the psaltery and the harp.1801 And it is a question which it is not out of place for
learned men to discuss, whether there is any musical law that compels the psaltery of ten
chords to have just so many strings; or whether, if there be no such law, the number itself
is not on that very account the more to be considered as of sacred significance, either with
reference to the ten commandments of the law (and if again any question is raised about
that number, we can only refer it to the Creator and the creature), or with reference to the
number ten itself as interpreted above. And the number of years the temple was in building,
which is mentioned in the gospel1802—viz., forty-six—has a certain undefinable musical
sound, and when referred to the structure of our Lord’s body, in relation to which the temple
was mentioned, compels many heretics to confess that our Lord put on, not a false, but a
true and human body. And in several places in the Holy Scriptures we find both numbers
and music mentioned with honor.</p>

<head>Chapter 17.—Origin of the Legend of the Nine Muses.</head>
<p>27. For we must not listen to the falsities of heathen superstition, which represent the
nine Muses as daughters of Jupiter and Mercury. Varro refutes these, and I doubt whether
any one can be found among them more curious or more learned in such matters. He says
that a certain state (I don’t recollect the name) ordered from each of three artists a set of
statues of the Muses, to be placed as an offering in the temple of Apollo, intending that
whichever of the artists produced the most beautiful statues, they should select and purchase
from him. It so happened that these artists executed their works with equal beauty, that all
nine pleased the state, and that all were bought to be dedicated in the temple of Apollo; and
he says that afterwards Hesiod the poet gave names to them all. It was not Jupiter, therefore,
that begat the nine Muses, but three artists created three each. And the state had originally
given the order for three, not because it had seen them in visions, nor because they had
presented themselves in that number to the eyes of any of the citizens, but because it was
obvious to remark that all sound, which is the material of song, is by nature of three kinds.
For it is either produced by the voice, as in the case of those who sing with the mouth without
an instrument; or by blowing, as in the case of trumpets and flutes; or by striking, as in the
case of harps and drums, and all other instruments that give their sound when struck.</p>

up music because of the superstition of the heathen, if we can derive anything from it that
is of use for the understanding of Holy Scripture; nor does it follow that we must busy
ourselves with their theatrical trumpery because we enter upon an investigation about harps
and other instruments, that may help us to lay hold upon spiritual things. For we ought
not to refuse to learn letters because they say that Mercury discovered them; nor because
they have dedicated temples to Justice and Virtue, and prefer to worship in the form of
stones things that ought to have their place in the heart, ought we on that account to forsake
justice and virtue. Nay, but let every good and true Christian understand that wherever
truth may be found, it belongs to his Master; and while he recognizes and acknowledges the
truth, even in their religious literature, let him reject the figments of superstition, and let
him grieve over and avoid men who, “when they knew God, glorified him not as God, neither
were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible
God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts,
and creeping things.”1803</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—Two Kinds Of Heathen Knowledge.</head>
<p>29. But to explain more fully this whole topic (for it is one that cannot be omitted),
there are two kinds of knowledge which are in vogue among the heathen. One is the
knowledge of things instituted by men, the other of things which they have noted, either as
transacted in the past or as instituted by God. The former kind, that which deals with human
institutions, is partly superstitious, partly not.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
<pb n="1232"/>
<head>Chapter 20.—The Superstitious Nature of Human Institutions.</head>
<p>30. All the arrangements made by men for the making and worshipping of idols are
superstitious, pertaining as they do either to the worship of what is created or of some part
of it as God, or to consultations and arrangements about signs and leagues with devils, such,
for example, as are employed in the magical arts, and which the poets are accustomed not
so much to teach as to celebrate. And to this class belong, but with a bolder reach of deception,
the books of the haruspices and augurs. In this class we must place also all amulets
and cures which the medical art condemns, whether these consist in incantations, or in
marks which they call characters, or in hanging or tying on or even dancing in a fashion
certain articles, not with reference to the condition of the body, but to certain signs hidden
or manifest; and these remedies they call by the less offensive name of physica, so as to appear
not to be engaged in superstitious observances, but to be taking advantage of the forces of
nature. Examples of these are the earrings on the top of each ear, or the rings of ostrich
bone on the fingers, or telling you when you hiccup to hold your left thumb in your right
hand.</p>
<p>31. To these we may add thousands of the most frivolous practices, that are to be observed
if any part of the body should jump, or if, when friends are walking arm-in-arm, a
stone, or a dog, or a boy, should come between them. And the kicking of a stone, as if it
were a divider of friends, does less harm than to cuff an innocent boy if he happens to run
between men who are walking side by side. But it is delightful that the boys are sometimes
avenged by the dogs; for frequently men are so superstitious as to venture upon striking a
dog who has run between them,—not with impunity however, for instead of a superstitious
remedy, the dog sometimes makes his assailant run in hot haste for a real surgeon. To this
class, too, belong the following rules: To tread upon the threshold when you go out in front
of the house; to go back to bed if any one should sneeze when you are putting on your slippers;
to return home if you stumble when going to a place; when your clothes are eaten by
mice, to be more frightened at the prospect of coming misfortune than grieved by your
present loss. Whence that witty saying of Cato, who, when consulted by a man who told
him that the mice had eaten his boots, replied, “That is not strange, but it would have been
very strange indeed if the boots had eaten the mice.”</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Superstition of Astrologers.</head>
<p>32. Nor can we exclude from this kind of superstition those who were called genethliaci,
on account of their attention to birthdays, but are now commonly called mathematici. For
these, too, although they may seek with pains for the true position of the stars at the time
of our birth, and may sometimes even find it out, yet in so far as they attempt thence to
predict our actions, or the consequences of our actions, grievously err, and sell inexperienced
men into a miserable bondage. For when any freeman goes to an as trologer of this kind,
he gives money that he may come away the slave either of Mars or of Venus, or rather,
perhaps, of all the stars to which those who first fell into this error, and handed it on to
posterity, have given the names either of beasts on account of their likeness to beasts, or of
men with a view to confer honor on those men. And this is not to be wondered at, when
we consider that even in times more recent and nearer our own, the Romans made an attempt
to dedicate the star which we call Lucifer to the name and honor of Cæsar. And this would,
perhaps, have been done, and the name handed down to distant ages, only that his ancestress
Venus had given her name to this star before him, and could not by any law transfer to her
heirs what she had never possessed, nor sought to possess, in life. For where a place was
vacant, or not held in honor of any of the dead of former times, the usual proceeding in
such cases was carried out. For example, we have changed the names of the months Quintilis
and Sextilis to July and August, naming them in honor of the men Julius Cæsar and
Augustus Cæsar; and from this instance any one who cares can easily see that the stars
spoken of above formerly wandered in the heavens without the names they now bear. But
as the men were dead whose memory people were either compelled by royal power or impelled
by human folly to honor, they seemed to think that in putting their names upon the
stars they were raising the dead men themselves to heaven. But whatever they may be called
by men, still there are stars which God has made and set in order after His own pleasure,
and they have a fixed movement, by which the seasons are distinguished and varied. And
when any one is born, it is easy to observe the point at which this movement has arrived,
by use of the rules discovered and laid down by those who are rebuked by Holy Writ in
these terms: “For if they were able to know so much that they could weigh the world, how
did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?”1804</p>

<head>Chapter 22 .—The Folly of Observing the Stars in Order to Predict the Events of a
Life.</head>
<p>33. But to desire to predict the characters, the acts, and the fate of those who are born
from such an observation, is a great delusion and great madness. And among those at least
who have any sort of acquaintance with matters of this kind (which, indeed, are only fit to
be unlearnt again), this superstition is refuted beyond the reach of doubt. For the observation
is of the position of the stars, which they call constellations, at the time when the person
was born about whom these wretched men are consulted by their still more wretched dupes.
Now it may happen that, in the case of twins, one follows the other out of the womb so
closely that there is no interval of time between them that can be apprehended and marked
in the position of the constellations. Whence it necessarily follows that twins are in many
cases born under the same stars, while they do not meet with equal fortune either in what
they do or what they suffer, but often meet with fates so different that one of them has a
most fortunate life, the other a most unfortunate. As, for example, we are told that Esau
and Jacob were born twins, and in such close succession, that Jacob, who was born last, was
found to have laid hold with his hand upon the heel of his brother, who preceded him.1805
Now, assuredly, the day and hour of the birth of these two could not be marked in any way
that would not give both the same constellation. But what a difference there was between
the characters, the actions, the labors, and the fortunes of these two, the Scriptures bear
witness, which are now so widely spread as to be in the mouth of all nations.</p>
<p>34. Nor is it to the point to say that the very smallest and briefest moment of time that
separates the birth of twins, produces great effects in nature, and in the extremely rapid
motion of the heavenly bodies. For, although I may grant that it does produce the greatest
effects, yet the astrologer cannot discover this in the constellations, and it is by looking into
these that he professes to read the fates. If, then, he does not discover the difference when
he examines the constellations, which must, of course, be the same whether he is consulted
about Jacob or his brother, what does it profit him that there is a difference in the heavens,
which he rashly and carelessly brings into disrepute, when there is no difference in his chart,
which he looks into anxiously but in vain? And so these notions also, which have their
origin in certain signs of things being arbitrarily fixed upon by the presumption of men, are
to be referred to the same class as if they were leagues and covenants with devils.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—Why We Repudiate Arts of Divination.</head>
<p>35. For in this way it comes to pass that men who lust after evil things are, by a secret
judgment of God, delivered over to be mocked and deceived, as the just reward of their evil
desires. For they are deluded and imposed on by the false angels, to whom the lowest part
of the world has been put in subjection by the law of God’s providence, and in accordance
with His most admirable arrangement of things. And the result of these delusions and deceptions
is, that through these superstitious and baneful modes of divination many things
in the past and future are made known, and turn out just as they are foretold and in the case
of those who practise superstitious observances, many things turn out agreeably to their
observances, and ensnared by these successes, they become more eagerly inquisitive, and
involve themselves further and further in a labyrinth of most pernicious error. And to our
advantage, the Word of God is not silent about this species of fornication of the soul; and
it does not warn the soul against following such practices on the ground that those who
profess them speak lies, but it says, “Even if what they tell you should come to pass, hearken
not unto them.”1806 For though the ghost of the dead Samuel foretold the truth to King
Saul,1807 that does not make such sacrilegious observances as those by which his ghost was
brought up the less detestable; and though the ventriloquist woman1808 in the Acts of the
Apostles bore true testimony to the apostles of the Lord, the Apostle Paul did not spare the
evil spirit on that account, but rebuked and cast it out, and so made the woman clean.1809</p>
<p>36. All arts of this sort, therefore, are either nullities, or are part of a guilty superstition,
springing out of a baleful fellowship between men and devils, and are to be utterly repudiated
and avoided by the Christian as the covenants of a false and treacherous friendship. “Not
as if the idol were anything,” says the apostle; “but because the things which they sacrifice
they sacrifice to devils and not to God; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with
devils.”1810 Now what the apostle has said about idols and the sacrifices offered in their
honor, that we ought to feel in regard to all fancied signs which lead either to the worship
of idols, or to worshipping creation or its parts instead of God, or which are connected with
attention to medicinal charms and other observances for these are not appointed by God
as the public means of promoting love towards God and our neighbor, but they waste the
hearts of wretched men in private and selfish strivings after temporal things. Accordingly,
in regard to all these branches of knowledge, we must fear and shun the fellowship of demons,

who, with the Devil their prince, strive only to shut and bar the door against our return.
As, then, from the stars which God created and ordained, men have drawn lying omens of
their own fancy, so also from things that are born, or in any other way come into existence
under the government of God’s providence, if there chance only to be something unusual
in the occurrence,—as when a mule brings forth young, or an object is struck by lightning,—
men have frequently drawn omens by conjectures of their own, and have committed
them to writing, as if they had drawn them by rule.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—The Intercourse and Agreement with Demons Which Superstitious

<p>37. And all these omens are of force just so far as has been arranged with the devils by
that previous understanding in the mind which is, as it were, the common language, but
they are all full of hurtful curiosity, torturing anxiety, and deadly slavery. For it was not
because they had meaning that they were attended to, but it was by attending to and marking
them that they came to have meaning. And so they are made different for different people,
according to their several notions and prejudices. For those spirits which are bent upon
deceiving, take care to provide for each person the same sort of omens as they see his own
conjectures and preconceptions have already entangled him in. For, to take an illustration,
the same figure of the letter X, which is made in the shape of a cross, means one thing among
the Greeks and another among the Latins, not by nature, but by agreement and pre-arrangement
as to its signification; and so, any one who knows both languages uses this letter in a
different sense when writing to a Greek from that in which he uses it when writing to a
Latin. And the same sound, beta, which is the name of a letter among the Greeks, is the
name of a vegetable among the Latins; and when I say, lege, these two syllables mean one
thing to a Greek and another to a Latin. Now, just as all these signs affect the mind according
to the arrangements of the community in which each man lives, and affect different men’s
minds differently, because these arrangements are different; and as, further, men did not
agree upon them as signs because they were already significant, but on the contrary they
are now significant because men have agreed upon them; in the same way also, those signs
by which the ruinous intercourse with devils is maintained have meaning just in proportion
to each man’s observations. And this appears quite plainly in the rites of the augurs; for
they, both before they observe the omens and after they have completed their observations,
take pains not to see the flight or hear the cries of birds, because these omens are of no significance
apart from the previous arrangement in the mind of the observer.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—In Human Institutions Which are Not Superstitious, There are Some
Things Superfluous and Some Convenient and Necessary.</head>
<p>38. But when all these have been cut away and rooted out of the mind of the Christian
we must then look at human institutions which are not superstitious, that is, such as are not
set up in association with devils, but by men in association with one another. For all arrangements
that are in force among men, because they have agreed among themselves that they
should be in force, are human institutions; and of these, some are matters of superfluity and
luxury, some of convenience and necessity. For if those signs which the actors make in
dancing were of force by nature, and not by the arrangement and agreement of men, the
public crier would not in former times have announced to the people of Carthage, while
the pantomime was dancing, what it was he meant to express,—a thing still remembered
by many old men from whom we have frequently heard it.1811 And we may well believe
this, because even now, if any one who is unaccustomed to such follies goes into the theatre,
unless some one tells him what these movements mean, he will give his whole attention to
them in vain. Yet all men aim at a certain degree of likeness in their choice of signs, that
the signs may as far as possible be like the things they signify. But because one thing may
resemble another in many ways, such signs are not always of the same significance among
men, except when they have mutually agreed upon them.</p>
<p>39. But in regard to pictures and statues, and other works of this kind, which are intended
as representations of things, nobody makes a mistake, especially if they are executed by
skilled artists, but every one, as soon as he sees the likenesses, recognizes the things they are
likenesses of. And this whole class are to be reckoned among the superfluous devices of
men, unless when it is a matter of importance to inquire in regard to any of them, for what
reason, where, when, and by whose authority it was made. Finally, the thousands of fables
and fictions, in whose lies men take delight, are human devices, and nothing is to be considered
more peculiarly man’s own and derived from himself than anything that is false and
lying. Among the convenient and necessary arrangements of men with men are to be
reckoned whatever differences they choose to make in bodily dress and ornament for the
purpose of distinguishing sex or rank; and the countless varieties of signs without which
human intercourse either could not be carried on at all, or would be carried on at great inconvenience;
and the arrangements as to weights and measures, and the stamping and
weighing of coins, which are peculiar to each state and people, and other things of the same
kind. Now these, if they were not devices of men, would not be different in different nations,
and could not be changed among particular nations at the discretion of their respective
sovereigns.</p>
<note type="footnote">1811 See Tylor’s Early History of Mankind, pp. 42, 43.</note>

<pb n="1239"/>
<p>40. This whole class of human arrangements, which are of convenience for the necessary
intercourse of life, the Christian is not by any means to neglect, but on the contrary should
pay a sufficient degree of attention to them, and keep them in memory.</p>

natural objects. And of these, such as have relation to fellowship with devils must, as has
been said, be utterly rejected and held in detestation; those, on the other hand, which relate
to the mutual intercourse of men, are, so far as they are not matters of luxury and superfluity,
to be adopted, especially the forms of the letters which are necessary for reading, and the
various languages as far as is required—a matter I have spoken of above.1812 To this class
also belong shorthand characters,1813 those who are acquainted with which are called
shorthand writers.1814 All these are useful, and there is nothing unlawful in learning them,
nor do they involve us in superstition, or enervate us by luxury, if they only occupy our
minds so far as not to stand in the way of more important objects to which they ought to
be subservient.</p>

<p>41. But, coming to the next point, we are not to reckon among human institutions those
things which men have handed down to us, not as arrangements of their own, but as the
result of investigation into the occurrences of the past, and into the arrangements of God’s
providence. And of these, some pertain to the bodily senses, some to the intellect. Those
which are reached by the bodily senses we either believe on testimony, or perceive when
they are pointed out to us, or infer from experience.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">
<pb n="1242"/>
<head>Chapter 28.—To What Extent History is an Aid.</head>
<p>42. Anything, then, that we learn from history about the chronology of past times assists
us very much in understanding the Scriptures, even if it be learnt without the pale of the
Church as a matter of childish instruction. For we frequently seek information about a
variety of matters by use of the Olympiads, and the names of the consuls; and ignorance of
the consulship in which our Lord was born, and that in which He suffered, has led some
into the error of supposing that He was forty-six years of age when He suffered, that being
the number of years He was told by the Jews the temple (which He took as a symbol of His
body) was in building.1815 Now we know on the authority of the evangelist that He was
about thirty years of age when He was baptized;1816 but the number of years He lived afterwards,
although by putting His actions together we can make it out, yet that no shadow of
doubt might arise from another source, can be ascertained more clearly and more certainly
from a comparison of profane history with the gospel. It will still be evident, however, that
it was not without a purpose it was said that the temple was forty and six years in building;
so that, as more secret formation of the body which, for our sakes, the only-begotten Son
of God, by whom all things were made, condescended to put on.1817</p>
<p>43. As to the utility of history, moreover, passing over the Greeks, what a great question
our own Ambrose has set at rest! For, when the readers and admirers of Plato dared
calumniously to assert that our Lord Jesus Christ learnt all those sayings of His, which they
are compelled to admire and praise, from the books of Plato—because (they urged) it cannot
be denied that Plato lived long before the coming of our Lord!—did not the illustrious
bishop, when by his investigations into profane history he had discovered that Plato made
a journey into Egypt at the time when Jeremiah the prophet was there,1818 show that it is
much more likely that Plato was through Jeremiah’s means initiated into our literature, so
as to be able to teach and write those views of his which are so justly praised? For not even
Pythagoras himself, from whose successors these men assert Plato learnt theology, lived at
a date prior to the books of that Hebrew race, among whom the worship of one God sprang
up, and of whom as concerning the flesh our Lord came. And thus, when we reflect upon
the dates, it becomes much more probable that those philosophers learnt whatever they said
that was good and true from our literature, than that the Lord Jesus Christ learnt from the
writings of Plato,—a thing which it is the height of folly to believe.</p>
<p>44. And even when in the course of an historical narrative former institutions of men
are described, the history itself is not to be reckoned among human institutions; because

<pb n="1243"/>
things that are past and gone and cannot be undone are to be reckoned as belonging to the
course of time, of which God is the author and governor. For it is one thing to tell what has
been done, another to show what ought to be done. History narrates what has been done,
faithfully and with advantage; but the books of the haruspices, and all writings of the same
kind, aim at teaching what ought to be done or observed, using the boldness of an adviser,
not the fidelity of a narrator.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
<pb n="1244"/>
<head>Chapter 29.—To What Extent Natural Science is an Exegetical Aid.</head>
<p>45. There is also a species of narrative resembling description, in which not a past but
an existing state of things is made known to those who are ignorant of it. To this species
belongs all that has been written about the situation of places, and the nature of animals,
trees, herbs, stones, and other bodies. And of this species I have treated above, and have
shown that this kind of knowledge is serviceable in solving the difficulties of Scripture, not
that these objects are to be used conformably to certain signs as nostrums or the instruments
of superstition; for that kind of knowledge I have already set aside as distinct from the lawful
and free kind now spoken of. For it is one thing to say: If you bruise down this herb and
drink it, it will remove the pain from your stomach; and another to say: If you hang this
herb round your neck, it will remove the pain from your stomach. In the former case the
wholesome mixture is approved of, in the latter the superstitious charm is condemned; although
indeed, where incantations and invocations and marks are not used, it is frequently
doubtful whether the thing that is tied or fixed in any way to the body to cure it, acts by a
natural virtue, in which case it may be freely used; or acts by a sort of charm, in which case
it becomes the Christian to avoid it the more carefully, the more efficacious it may seem to
be. But when the reason why a thing is of virtue does not appear, the intention with which
it is used is of great importance, at least in healing or in tempering bodies, whether in
medicine or in agriculture.</p>
<p>46. The knowledge of the stars, again, is not a matter of narration, but of description.
Very few of these, however, are mentioned in Scripture. And as the course of the moon,
which is regularly employed in reference to celebrating the anniversary of our Lord’s passion,
is known to most people; so the rising and setting and other movements of the rest of the
heavenly bodies are thoroughly known to very few. And this knowledge, although in itself
it involves no superstition, renders very little, indeed almost no assistance, in the interpretation
of Holy Scripture, and by engaging the attention unprofitably is a hindrance rather;
and as it is closely related to the very pernicious error of the diviners of the fates, it is more
convenient and becoming to neglect it. It involves, moreover, in addition to a description
of the present state of things, something like a narrative of the past also; because one may
go back from the present position and motion of the stars, and trace by rule their past
movements. It involves also regular anticipations of the future, not in the way of forebodings
and omens, but by way of sure calculation; not with the design of drawing any information
from them as to our own acts and fates, in the absurd fashion of the genethliaci, but only
as to the motions of the heavenly bodies themselves. For, as the man who computes the
moon’s age can tell, when he has found out her age today, what her age was any number of
years ago, or what will be her age any number of years hence, in just the same way men who
are skilled in such computations are accustomed to answer like questions about every one

<pb n="1245"/>
of the heavenly bodies. And I have stated what my views are about all this knowledge, so
far as regards its utility.</p>

when the effort of the workman is over, remains as a result of his work, as, for example, a
house, a bench, a dish, and other things of that kind; or those which, so to speak, assist God
in His operations, as medicine, and agriculture, and navigation; or those whose sole result
is an action, as dancing, and racing, and wrestling;—in all these arts experience teaches us
to infer the future from the past. For no man who is skilled in any of these arts moves his
limbs in any operation without connecting the memory of the past with the expectation of
the future. Now of these arts a very superficial and cursory knowledge is to be acquired,
not with a view to practising them (unless some duty compel us, a matter on which I do not
touch at present), but with a view to forming a judgment about them, that we may not be
wholly ignorant of what Scripture means to convey when it employs figures of speech derived
from these arts.</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Use of Dialectics. Of Fallacies.</head>
<p>48. There remain those branches of knowledge which pertain not to the bodily senses,
but to the intellect, among which the science of reasoning and that of number are the chief.
The science of reasoning is of very great service in searching into and unravelling all sorts
of questions that come up in Scripture, only in the use of it we must guard against the love
of wrangling, and the childish vanity of entrapping an adversary. For there are many of
what are called sophisms, inferences in reasoning that are false, and yet so close an imitation
of the true, as to deceive not only dull people, but clever men too, when they are not on their
guard. For example, one man lays before another with whom he is talking, the proposition,
“What I am, you are not.” The other assents, for the proposition is in part true, the one
man being cunning and the other simple. Then the first speaker adds: “I am a man;” and
when the other has given his assent to this also, the first draws his conclusion: “Then you
are not a man.” Now of this sort of ensnaring arguments, Scripture, as I judge, expresses
detestation in that place where it is said, “There is one that showeth wisdom in words, and
is hated;”1819 although, indeed, a style of speech which is not intended to entrap, but only
aims at verbal ornamentation more than is consistent with seriousness of purpose, is also
called sophistical.</p>
<p>49. There are also valid processes of reasoning which lead to false conclusions, by following
out to its logical consequences the error of the man with whom one is arguing; and
these conclusions are sometimes drawn by a good and learned man, with the object of
making the person from whose error these consequences result, feel ashamed of them and
of thus leading him to give up his error when he finds that if he wishes to retain his old
opinion, he must of necessity also hold other opinions which he condemns. For example,
the apostle did not draw true conclusions when he said, “Then is Christ not risen,” and
again, “Then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain;”1820 and further on drew
other inferences which are all utterly false; for Christ has risen, the preaching of those who
declared this fact was not in vain, nor was their faith in vain who had believed it. But all
these false inferences followed legitimately from the opinion of those who said that there is
no resurrection of the dead. These inferences, then, being repudiated as false, it follows that
since they would be true if the dead rise not, there will be a resurrection of the dead. As,
then, valid conclusions may be drawn not only from true but from false propositions, the
laws of valid reasoning may easily be learnt in the schools, outside the pale of the Church.
But the truth of propositions must be inquired into in the sacred books of the Church.</p>

<head>Chapter 32.—Valid Logical Sequence is Not Devised But Only Observed by Man.</head>
<p>50. And yet the validity of logical sequences is not a thing devised by men, but is observed
and noted by them that they may be able to learn and teach it; for it exists eternally in the
reason of things, and has its origin with God. For as the man who narrates the order of
events does not himself create that order; and as he who describes the situations of places,
or the natures of animals, or roots, or minerals, does not describe arrangements of man;
and as he who points out the stars and their movements does not point out anything that
he himself or any other man has ordained;—in the same way, he who says, “When the
consequent is false, the antecedent must also be false,” says what is most true; but he does
not himself make it so, he only points out that it is so. And it is upon this rule that the
reasoning I have quoted from the Apostle Paul proceeds. For the antecedent is, “There is
no resurrection of the dead,”—the position taken up by those whose error the apostle wished
to overthrow. Next, from this antecedent, the assertion, viz., that there is no resurrection
of the dead, the necessary consequence is, “Then Christ is not risen.” But this consequence
is false, for Christ has risen; therefore the antecedent is also false. But the antecedent is, that
there is no resurrection of the dead. We conclude, therefore, that there is a resurrection of
the dead. Now all this is briefly expressed thus: If there is no resurrection of the dead, then
is Christ not risen; but Christ is risen, therefore there is a resurrection of the dead. This
rule, then, that when the consequent is removed, the antecedent must also be removed, is
not made by man, but only pointed out by him. And this rule has reference to the validity
of the reasoning, not to the truth of the statements.</p>

<pb n="1249"/>
<head>Chapter 33.—False Inferences May Be Drawn from Valid Reasonings, and Vice
Versa.</head>
<p>51. In this passage, however, where the argument is about the resurrection, both the
law of the inference is valid, and the conclusion arrived at is true. But in the case of false
conclusions, too, there is a validity of inference in some such way as the following. Let us
suppose some man to have admitted: If a snail is an animal, it has a voice. This being admitted,
then, when it has been proved that the snail has no voice, it follows (since when the
consequent is proved false, the antecedent is also false) that the snail is not an animal. Now
this conclusion is false, but it is a true and valid inference from the false admission. Thus,
the truth of a statement stands on its own merits; the validity of an inference depends on
the statement or the admission of the man with whom one is arguing. And thus, as I said
above, a false inference may be drawn by a valid process of reasoning, in order that he whose
error we wish to correct may be sorry that he has admitted the antecedent, when he sees
that its logical consequences are utterly untenable. And hence it is easy to understand that
as the inferences may be valid where the opinions are false, so the inferences may be unsound
where the opinions are true. For example, suppose that a man propounds the statement,
“If this man is just, he is good,” and we admit its truth. Then he adds, “But he is not just;”
and when we admit this too, he draws the conclusion, “Therefore he is not good.” Now al-
though every one of these statements may be true, still the principle of the inference is unsound.
For it is not true that, as when the consequent is proved false the antecedent is also
false, so when the antecedent is proved false the consequent is false. For the statement is
true, “If he is an orator, he is a man.” But if we add, “He is not an orator,” the consequence
does not follow, “He is not a man.”</p>

<pb n="1250"/>
<head>Chapter 34.—It is One Thing to Know the Laws of Inference, Another to Know the
Truth of Opinions.</head>
<p>52. Therefore it is one thing to know the laws of inference, and another to know the
truth of opinions. In the former case we learn what is consequent, what is inconsequent,
and what is incompatible. An example of a consequent is, “If he is an orator, he is a man;”
of an inconsequent, “If he is a man, he is an orator;” of an incompatible, “If he is a man, he
is a quadruped.” In these instances we judge of the connection. In regard to the truth of
opinions, however, we must consider propositions as they stand by themselves, and not in
their connection with one another; but when propositions that we are not sure about are
joined by a valid inference to propositions that are true and certain, they themselves, too,
necessarily become certain. Now some, when they have ascertained the validity of the inference,
plume themselves as if this involved also the truth of the propositions. Many, again,
who hold the true opinions have an unfounded contempt for themselves, because they are
ignorant of the laws of inference; whereas the man who knows that there is a resurrection
of the dead is assuredly better than the man who only knows that it follows that if there is
no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen.</p>

<head>Chapter 35 .—The Science of Definition is Not False, Though It May Be Applied to
Falsities.</head>
<p>53. Again, the science of definition, of division, and of partition, although it is frequently
applied to falsities, is not itself false, nor framed by man’s device, but is evolved from the
reason of things. For although poets have applied it to their fictions, and false philosophers,
or even heretics—that is, false Christians—to their erroneous doctrines, that is no reason
why it should be false, for example, that neither in definition, nor in division, nor in partition,
is anything to be included that does not pertain to the matter in hand, nor anything to be
omitted that does. This is true, even though the things to be defined or divided are not true.
For even falsehood itself is defined when we say that falsehood is the declaration of a state
of things which is not as we declare it to be; and this definition is true, although falsehood
itself cannot be true. We can also divide it, saying that there are two kinds of falsehood, one
in regard to things that cannot be true at all, the other in regard to things that are not, though
it is possible they might be, true. For example, the man who says that seven and three are
eleven, says what cannot be true under any circumstances; but he who says that it rained
on the kalends of January, although perhaps the fact is not so, says what posssibly might
have been. The definition and division, therefore, of what is false may be perfectly true, although
what is false cannot, of course, itself be true.</p>

<p>54. There are also certain rules for a more copious kind of argument, which is called
eloquence, and these rules are not the less true that they can be used for persuading men of
what is false; but as they can be used to enforce the truth as well, it is not the faculty itself
that is to be blamed, but the perversity of those who put it to a bad use. Nor is it owing to
an arrangement among men that the expression of affection conciliates the hearer, or that
a narrative, when it is short and clear, is effective, and that variety arrests men’s attention
without wearying them. And it is the same with other directions of the same kind, which,
whether the cause in which they are used be true or false, are themselves true just in so far
as they are effective in producing knowledge or belief, or in moving men’s minds to desire
and aversion. And men rather found out that these things are so, than arranged that they
should be so.</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—Use of Rhetoric and Dialectic.</head>
<p>55. This art, however, when it is learnt, is not to be used so much for ascertaining the
meaning as for setting forth the meaning when it is ascertained. But the art previously
spoken of, which deals with inferences, and definitions, and divisions, is of the greatest assistance
in the discovery of the meaning, provided only that men do not fall into the error
of supposing that when they have learnt these things they have learnt the true secret of a
happy life. Still, it sometimes happens that men find less difficulty in attaining the ob ject
for the sake of which these sciences are learnt, than in going through the very intricate and
thorny discipline of such rules. It is just as if a man wishing to give rules for walking should
warn you not to lift the hinder foot before you set down the front one, and then should describe
minutely the way you ought to move the hinges of the joints and knees. For what he
says is true, and one cannot walk in any other way; but men find it easier to walk by executing
these movements than to attend to them while they are going through them, or to understand
when they are told about them. Those, on the other hand, who cannot walk, care still less
about such directions, as they cannot prove them by making trial of them. And in the same
way a clever man often sees that an inference is unsound more quickly than he apprehends
the rules for it. A dull man, on the other hand, does not see the unsoundness, but much
less does he grasp the rules. And in regard to all these laws, we derive more pleasure from
them as exhibitions of truth, than assistance in arguing or forming opinions, except perhaps
that they put the intellect in better training. We must take care, however that they do not
at the same time make it more inclined to mischief or vanity,—that is to say, that they do
not give those who have learnt them an inclination to lead people astray by plausible speech
and catching questions, or make them think that they have attained some great thing that
gives them an advantage over the good and innocent.</p>

<head>Chapter 38.—The Science of Numbers Not Created, But Only Discovered, by Man.</head>
<p>56. Coming now to the science of number, it is clear to the dullest apprehension that
this was not created by man, but was discovered by investigation. For, though Virgil could
at his own pleasure make the first syllable of Italia long, while the ancients pronounced it
short, it is not in any man’s power to determine at his pleasure that three times three are
not nine, or do not make a square, or are not the triple of three, nor one and a half times
the number six, or that it is not true that they are not the double of any number because
odd numbers1821 have no half. Whether, then, numbers are considered in themselves, or
as applied to the laws of figures, or of sounds, or of other motions, they have fixed laws
which were not made by man, but which the acuteness of ingenious men brought to light.</p>
<p>57. The man, however, who puts so high a value on these things as to be inclined to
boast himself one of the learned, and who does not rather inquire after the source from
which those things which he perceives to be true derive their truth, and from which those
others which he perceives to be unchangeable also derive their truth and unchangeableness,
and who, mounting up from bodily appearances to the mind of man, and finding that it too
is changeable (for it is sometimes instructed, at other times uninstructed), although it holds
a middle place between the unchangeable truth above it and the changeable things beneath
it, does not strive to make all things redound to the praise and love of the one God from
whom he knows that all things have their being;—the man, I say, who acts in this way may
seem to be learned, but wise he cannot in any sense be deemed.</p>

<head>Chapter 39.—To Which of the Above-Mentioned Studies Attention Should Be
Given, and in What Spirit.</head>
<p>58. Accordingly, I think that it is well to warn studious and able young men, who fear
God and are seeking for happiness of life, not to venture heedlessly upon the pursuit of the
branches of learning that are in vogue beyond the pale of the Church of Christ, as if these
could secure for them the happiness they seek; but soberly and carefully to discriminate
among them. And if they find any of those which have been instituted by men varying by
reason of the varying pleasure of their founders, and unknown by reason of erroneous
conjectures, especially if they involve entering into fellowship with devils by means of leagues
and covenants about signs, let these be utterly rejected and held in detestation. Let the young
men also withdraw their attention from such institutions of men as are unnecessary and
luxurious. But for the sake of the necessities of this life we must not neglect the arrangements
of men that enable us to carry on intercourse with those around us. I think, however, there
is nothing useful in the other branches of learning that are found among the heathen, except
information about objects, either past or present, that relate to the bodily senses, in which
are included also the experiments and conclusions of the useful mechanical arts, except also
the sciences of reasoning and of number. And in regard to all these we must hold by the
maxim, “Not too much of anything;” especially in the case of those which, pertaining as
they do to the senses, are subject to the relations of space and time.1822</p>
<p>59. What, then, some men have done in regard to all words and names found in
Scripture, in the Hebrew, and Syriac, and Egyptian, and other tongues, taking up and interpreting
separately such as were left in Scripture without interpretation; and what Eusebius
has done in regard to the history of the past with a view to the questions arising in Scripture
that require a knowledge of history for their solution;—what, I say, these men have done in
regard to matters of this kind, making it unnecessary for the Christian to spend his strength
on many subjects for the sake of a few items of knowledge, the same, I think, might be done
in regard to other matters, if any competent man were willing in a spirit of benevolence to
undertake the labor for the advantage of his brethren. In this way he might arrange in their
several classes, and give an account of the unknown places, and animals, and plants, and
trees, and stones, and metals, and other species of things that are mentioned in Scripture,
taking up these only, and committing his account to writing. This might also be done in
relation to numbers, so that the theory of those numbers, and those only, which are mentioned
in Holy Scripture, might be explained and written down. And it may happen that
some or all of these things have been done already (as I have found that many things I had
no notion of have been worked out and committed to writing by good and learned Christians),
but are either lost amid the crowds of the careless, or are kept out of sight by the envi-

ous. And I am not sure whether the same thing can be done in regard to the theory of
reasoning; but it seems to me it cannot, because this runs like a system of nerves through
the whole structure of Scripture, and on that account is of more service to the reader in
disentangling and explaining ambiguous passages, of which I shall speak hereafter, than in
ascertaining the meaning of unknown signs, the topic I am now discussing.</p>

<head>Chapter 40.—Whatever Has Been Rightly Said by the Heathen, We Must Appropriate
to Our Uses.</head>
<p>60. Moreover, if those who are called philosophers, and especially the Platonists, have
said aught that is true and in harmony with our faith, we are not only not to shrink from it,
but to claim it for our own use from those who have unlawful possession of it. For, as the
Egyptians had not only the idols and heavy burdens which the people of Israel hated and
fled from, but also vessels and ornaments of gold and silver, and garments, which the same
people when going out of Egypt appropriated to themselves, designing them for a better
use, not doing this on their own authority, but by the command of God, the Egyptians
themselves, in their ignorance, providing them with things which they themselves were not
making a good use of;1823 in the same way all branches of heathen learning have not only
false and superstitious fancies and heavy burdens of unnecessary toil, which every one of
us, when going out under the leadership of Christ from the fellowship of the heathen, ought
to abhor and avoid; but they contain also liberal instruction which is better adapted to the
use of the truth, and some most excellent precepts of morality; and some truths in regard
even to the worship of the One God are found among them. Now these are, so to speak,
their gold and silver, which they did not create themselves, but dug out of the mines of God’s
providence which are everywhere scattered abroad, and are perversely and unlawfully
prostituting to the worship of devils. These, therefore, the Christian, when he separates
himself in spirit from the miserable fellowship of these men, ought to take away from them,
and to devote to their proper use in preaching the gospel. Their garments, also,—that is,
human institutions such as are adapted to that intercourse with men which is indispensable
in this life,—we must take and turn to a Christian use.</p>
<p>61. And what else have many good and faithful men among our brethren done? Do
we not see with what a quantity of gold and silver and garments Cyprian, that most persuasive
teacher and most blessed martyr, was loaded when he came out of Egypt? How much
Lactantius brought with him? And Victorinus, and Optatus, and Hilary, not to speak of
living men! How much Greeks out of number have borrowed! And prior to all these, that
most faithful servant of God, Moses, had done the same thing; for of him it is written that
he was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.1824 And to none of all these would heathen
superstition (especially in those times when, kicking against the yoke of Christ, it was persecuting
the Christians) have ever furnished branches of knowledge it held useful, if it had
suspected they were about to turn them to the use of worshipping the One God, and thereby
overturning the vain worship of idols. But they gave their gold and their silver and their
garments to the people of God as they were going out of Egypt, not knowing how the things

exodus was no doubt a type prefiguring what happens now. And this I say without prejudice
to any other interpretation that may be as good, or better.</p>

<p>62. But when the student of the Holy Scriptures, prepared in the way I have indicated,
shall enter upon his investigations, let him constantly meditate upon that saying of the
apostle’s, “Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.”1825 For so he will feel that, whatever
may be the riches he brings with him out of Egypt, yet unless he has kept the passover, he
cannot be safe. Now Christ is our passover sacrificed for us,1826 and there is nothing the
sacrifice of Christ more clearly teaches us than the call which He himself addresses to those
whom He sees toiling in Egypt under Pharaoh: “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and
my burden is light.”1827 To whom is it light but to the meek and lowly in heart, whom
knowledge doth not puff up, but charity edifieth? Let them remember, then, that those who
celebrated the passover at that time in type and shadow, when they were ordered to mark
their door-posts with the blood of the lamb, used hyssop to mark them with.1828 Now this
is a meek and lowly herb, and yet nothing is stronger and more penetrating than its roots;
that being rooted and grounded in love, we may be able to comprehend with all saints what
is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,1829—that is, to comprehend the cross of
our Lord, the breadth of which is indicated by the transverse wood on which the hands are
stretched, its length by the part from the ground up to the cross-bar on which the whole
body from the head downwards is fixed, its height by the part from the crossbar to the top
on which the head lies, and its depth by the part which is hidden, being fixed in the earth.
And by this sign of the cross all Christian action is symbolized, viz., to do good works in
Christ, to cling with constancy to Him, to hope for heaven, and not to desecrate the sacraments.
And purified by this Christian action, we shall be able to know even “the love of
Christ which passeth knowledge,” who is equal to the Father, by whom all things, were
made, “that we may be filled with all the fullness of God.”1830 There is besides in hyssop a
purgative virtue, that the breast may not be swollen with that knowledge which puffeth up,
nor boast vainly of the riches brought out from Egypt. “Purge me with hyssop,” the
psalmist says,1831 “and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me

Israel brought with them out of Egypt was in comparison with the riches which they afterwards
attained at Jerusalem, and which reached their height in the reign of King Solomon,
so poor is all the useful knowledge which is gathered from the books of the heathen when
compared with the knowledge of Holy Scripture. For whatever man may have learnt from
other sources, if it is hurtful, it is there condemned; if it is useful, it is therein contained.

<p>Argument—The author, having discussed in the preceding book the method of dealing
with unknown signs, goes on in this third book to treat of ambiguous signs. Such signs may
be either direct or figurative. In the case of direct signs ambiguity may arise from the punctuation,
the pronunciation, or the doubtful signification of the words, and is to be resolved by
attention to the context, a comparison of translations, or a reference to the original tongue.
In the case of figurative signs we need to guard against two mistakes:—1. the interpreting literal
expressions figuratively; 2. the interpreting figurative expressions literally. The author
lays down rules by which we may decide whether an expression is literal or figurative; the
general rule being, that whatever can be shown to be in its literal sense inconsistent either with
purity of life or correctness of doctrine must be taken figuratively. He then goes on to lay down
rules for the interpretation of expressions which have been proved to be figurative; the general
principle being, that no interpretation can be true which does not promote the love of God
and the love of man. The author then proceeds to expound and illustrate the seven rules of
Tichonius the Donatist, which he commends to the attention of the student of Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>I. The man who fears God seeks diligently in Holy Scripture for a knowledge of His
will. And when he has become meek through piety, so as to have no love of strife; when
furnished also with a knowledge of languages, so as not to be stopped by unknown words
and forms of speech, and with the knowledge of certain necessary objects, so as not to be
ignorant of the force and nature of those which are used figuratively; and assisted, besides,
by accuracy in the texts, which has been secured by skill and care in the matter of correction;—
when thus prepared, let him proceed to the examination and solution of the ambiguities
of Scripture. And that he may not be led astray by ambiguous signs, so far as I can give
him instruction (it may happen, however, that either from the greatness of his intellect, or
the greater clearness of the light he enjoys, he shall laugh at the methods I am going to point
out as childish),—but yet, as I was going to say, so far as I can give instruction, let him who
is in such a state of mind that he can be instructed by me know, that the ambiguity of
Scripture lies either in proper words or in metaphorical, classes which I have already described
in the second book.1833</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—Rule for Removing Ambiguity by Attending to Punctution.</head>
<p>2. But when proper words make Scripture ambiguous, we must see in the first place
that there is nothing wrong in our punctuation or pronunciation. Accordingly, if, when
attention is given to the passage, it shall appear to be uncertain in what way it ought to be
punctuated or pronounced, let the reader consult the rule of faith which he has gathered
from the plainer passages of Scripture, and from the authority of the Church, and of which
I treated at sufficient length when I was speaking in the first book about things. But if both
readings, or all of them (if there are more than two), give a meaning in harmony with the
faith, it remains to consult the context, both what goes before and what comes after, to see
which interpretation, out of many that offer themselves, it pronounces for and permits to
be dovetailed into itself.</p>
<p>3. Now look at some examples. The heretical pointing,1834 “In principio erat verbum,
et verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat,”1835 so as to make the next sentence run, “Verbum
hoc erat in principio apud Deum,”1836 arises out of unwillingness to confess that the Word
was God. But this must be rejected by the rule of faith, which, in reference to the equality
of the Trinity, directs us to say: “et Deus erat verbum;”1837 and then to add: “hoc erat in
principio apud Deum.”1838</p>
<p>4. But the following ambiguity of punctuation does not go against the faith in either
way you take it, and therefore must be decided from the context. It is where the apostle
says: “What I shall choose I wot not: for I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
and to be with Christ, which is far better: nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more
needful for you.”1839 Now it is uncertain whether we should read, “ex duobus concupiscentiam
habens” [having a desire for two things], or “compellor autem ex duobus” [I am in a
strait betwixt two]; and so to add: “concupiscentiam habens dissolvi, et esse cum Christo”
[having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ]. But since there follows “multo enim magis
optimum” [for it is far better], it is evident that he says he has a desire for that which is better;
so that, while he is in a strait betwixt two, yet he has a desire for one and sees a necessity for
the other; a desire, viz., to be with Christ, and a necessity to remain in the flesh. Now this
ambiguity is resolved by one word that follows, which is translated enim [for]; and the
translators who have omitted this particle have preferred the interpretation which makes

<pb n="1265"/>
the apostle seem not only in a strait betwixt two, but also to have a desire for two.1840 We
must therefore punctuate the sentence thus: “et quid eligam ignoro: compellor autem ex
duobus” <del>what I shall choose I wot not: for I am in a strait betwixt two</del>; and after this point
follows: “concupiscentiam habens dissolvi, et esse cum Christo” <del>having a desire to depart,
and to be with Christ</del>. And, as if he were asked why he has a desire for this in preference
to the other, he adds: “multo enim magis optimum” <del>for it is far better</del>. Why, then, is he
in a strait betwixt the two? Because there is a need for his remaining, which he adds in these
terms: “manere in carne necessarium propter vos” <del>nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more
needful for you</del>.</p>
<p>5. Where, however, the ambiguity cannot be cleared up, either by the rule of faith or
by the context, there is nothing to hinder us to point the sentence according to any method
we choose of those that suggest themselves. As is the case in that passage to the Corinthians:
“Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Receive us; we have wronged
no man.”1841 It is doubtful whether we should read, “mundemus nos ab omni coinquinatione
carnis et spiritus” <del>let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit</del>, in accordance
with the passage, “that she may be holy both in body and in spirit,”1842 or,
“mundemus nos ab omni coinquinatione carnis” <del>let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
of the flesh</del>, so as to make the next sentence, “et spiritus perficientes sanctificationem in
timore Dei capite nos” <del>and perfecting holiness of spirit in the fear of God, receive us</del>. Such
ambiguities of punctuation, therefore, are left to the reader’s discretion.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—How Pronunciation Serves to Remove Ambiguity. Different Kinds of
Interrogation.</head>
<p>6. And all the directions that I have given about ambiguous punctuations are to be observed
likewise in the case of doubtful pronunciations. For these too, unless the fault lies
in the carelessness of the reader, are corrected either by the rule of faith, or by a reference
to the preceding or succeeding context; or if neither of these methods is applied with success,
they will remain doubtful, but so that the reader will not be in fault in whatever way he may
pronounce them. For example, if our faith that God will not bring any charges against His
elect, and that Christ will not condemn His elect, did not stand in the way, this passage,
“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?” might be pronounced in such a way
as to make what follows an answer to this question, “God who justifieth,” and to make a
second question, “Who is he that condemneth?” with the answer, “Christ Jesus who
died.”1843 But as it would be the height of madness to believe this, the passage will be pronounced
in such a way as to make the first part a question of inquiry,1844 and the second a
rhetorical interrogative.1845 Now the ancients said that the difference between an inquiry
and an interrogative was this, that an inquiry admits of many answers, but to an interrogative
the answer must be either “No” or “Yes.”1846 The passage will be pronounced, then, in such
a way that after the inquiry, “Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?” what
follows will be put as an interrogative: “Shall God who justifieth?”—the answer “No” being
understood. And in the same way we shall have the inquiry, “Who is he that condemneth?”
and the answer here again in the form of an interrogative, “Is it Christ who died? yea, rather,
who is risen again? who is even at the right hand of God? who also maketh intercession for
us?”—the answer “No” being understood to every one of these questions. On the other
hand, in that passage where the apostle says, “What shall we say then? That the Gentiles
which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness;”1847 unless after the
inquiry, “What shall we say then?” what follows were given as the answer to this question:
“That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness;”
it would not be in harmony with the succeeding context. But with whatever tone of voice
one may choose to pronounce that saying of Nathanael’s, “Can any good thing come out
of Nazareth?”1848—whether with that of a man who gives an affirmative answer, so that
<note type="footnote">1843 Rom. viii. 33, 34.</note>

<pb n="1267"/>
“out of Nazareth” is the only part that belongs to the interrogation, or with that of a man
who asks the whole question with doubt and hesitation,—I do not see how a difference can
be made. But neither sense is opposed to faith.</p>
<p>7. There is, again, an ambiguity arising out of the doubtful sound of syllables; and this
of course has relation to pronunciation. For example, in the passage, “My bone [os meum]
was not hid from Thee, which Thou didst make in secret,”1849 it is not clear to the reader
whether he should take the word os as short or long. If he make it short, it is the singular
of ossa [bones]; if he make it long, it is the singular of ora [mouths]. Now difficulties such
as this are cleared up by looking into the original tongue, for in the Greek we find not στόμα
[mouth], but ὁστέον [bone]. And for this reason the vulgar idiom is frequently more useful
in conveying the sense than the pure speech of the educated. For I would rather have the
barbarism, non est absconditum a te ossum meum,1850 than have the passage in better Latin,
but the sense less clear. But sometimes when the sound of a syllable is doubtful, it is decided
by a word near it belonging to the same sentence. As, for example, that saying of the apostle,
“Of the which I tell you before [prædico], as I have also told you in time past [proedixi], that
they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”1851 Now if he had only
said, “Of the which I tell you before [quæ prædico vobis],” and had not added, “as I have
also told you in time past [sicut proedixi],” we could not know without going back to the
original whether in the word prædico the middle syllable should be pronounced long or
short. But as it is, it is clear that it should be pronounced long; for he does not say, sicut
proedicavi, but sicut prædixi.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—How Ambiguities May Be Solved.</head>
<p>8. And not only these, but also those ambiguities that do not relate either to punctuation
or pronunciation, are to be examined in the same way. For example, that one in the Epistle
to the Thessalonians: Propterea consolati sumus fratres in vobis.1852 Now it is doubtful
whether fratres [brethren] is in the vocative or accusative case, and it is not contrary to faith
to take it either way. But in the Greek language the two cases are not the same in form; and
accordingly, when we look into the original, the case is shown to be vocative. Now if the
translator had chosen to say, propterea consolationem habuimus fratres in vobis, he would
have followed the words less literally, but there would have been less doubt about the
meaning; or, indeed, if he had added nostri, hardly any one would have doubted that the
vocative case was meant when he heard propterea consolati sumus fratres nostri in vobis.
But this is a rather dangerous liberty to take. It has been taken, however, in that passage to
the Corinthians, where the apostle says, “I protest by your rejoicing [per vestram gloriam]
which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.”1853 For one translator has it, per vestram
jurogloriam, the form of adjuration appearing in the Greek without any ambiguity. It is
therefore very rare and very difficult to find any ambiguity in the case of proper words, as
far at least as Holy Scripture is concerned, which neither the context, showing the design
of the writer, nor a comparison of translations, nor a reference to the original tongue, will
suffice to explain.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—It is a Wretched Slavery Which Takes the Figurative Expressions of
Scripture in a Literal Sense.</head>
<p>9. But the ambiguities of metaphorical words, about which I am next to speak, demand
no ordinary care and diligence. In the first place, we must beware of taking a figurative expression
literally. For the saying of the apostle applies in this case too: “The letter killeth,
but the spirit giveth life.”1854 For when what is said figuratively is taken as if it were said
literally, it is understood in a carnal manner. And nothing is more fittingly called the death
of the soul than when that in it which raises it above the brutes, the intelligence namely, is
put in subjection to the flesh by a blind adherence to the letter. For he who follows the letter
takes figurative words as if they were proper, and does not carry out what is indicated by a
proper word into its secondary signification; but, if he hears of the Sabbath, for example,
thinks of nothing but the one day out of seven which recurs in constant succession; and
when he hears of a sacrifice, does not carry his thoughts beyond the customary offerings of
victims from the flock, and of the fruits of the earth. Now it is surely a miserable slavery of
the soul to take signs for things, and to be unable to lift the eye of the mind above what is
corporeal and created, that it may drink in eternal light.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Utility of the Bondage of the Jews.</head>
<p>10. This bondage, however, in the case of the Jewish people, differed widely from what
it was in the case of the other nations; because, though the former were in bondage to temporal
things, it was in such a way that in all these the One God was put before their minds.
And although they paid attention to the signs of spiritual realities in place of the realities
themselves, not knowing to what the signs referred, still they had this conviction rooted in
their minds, that in subjecting themselves to such a bondage they were doing the pleasure
of the one invisible God of all. And the apostle describes this bondage as being like to that
of boys under the guidance of a schoolmaster.1855 And those who clung obstinately to such
signs could not endure our Lord’s neglect of them when the time for their revelation had
come; and hence their leaders brought it as a charge against Him that He healed on the
Sabbath, and the people, clinging to these signs as if they were realities, could not believe
that one who refused to observe them in the way the Jews did was God, or came from God.
But those who did believe, from among whom the first Church at Jerusalem was formed,
showed clearly how great an advantage it had been to be so guided by the schoolmaster that
signs, which had been for a season imposed on the obedient, fixed the thoughts of those
who observed them on the worship of the One God who made heaven and earth. These
men, because they had been very near to spiritual things (for even in the temporal and carnal
offerings and types, though they did not clearly apprehend their spiritual meaning, they had
learnt to adore the One Eternal God,) were filled with such a measure of the Holy Spirit that
they sold all their goods, and laid their price at the apostles’ feet to be distributed among
the needy,1856 and consecrated themselves wholly to God as a new temple, of which the old
temple they were serving was but the earthly type.</p>
<p>11. Now it is not recorded that any of the Gentile churches did this, because men who
had for their gods idols made with hands had not been so near to spiritual things.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—The Useless Bondage of the Gentiles.</head>
<p>And if ever any of them endeavored to make it out that their idols were only signs, yet
still they used them in reference to the worship and adoration of the creature. What difference
does it make to me, for instance, that the image of Neptune is not itself to be considered
a god, but only as representing the wide ocean, and all the other waters besides that spring
out of fountains? As it is described by a poet of theirs,1857 who says, if I recollect aright,
“Thou, Father Neptune, whose hoary temples are wreathed with the resounding sea, whose
beard is the mighty ocean flowing forth unceasingly, and whose hair is the winding rivers.”
This husk shakes its rattling stones within a sweet covering, and yet it is not food for men,
but for swine. He who knows the gospel knows what I mean.1858 What profit is it to me,
then, that the image of Neptune is used with a reference to this explanation of it, unless indeed
the result be that I worship neither? For any statue you like to take is as much god to me
as the wide ocean. I grant, however, that they who make gods of the works of man have
sunk lower than they who make gods of the works of God. But the command is that we
should love and serve the One God, who is the Maker of all those things, the images of which
are worshipped by the heathen either as gods, or as signs and representations of gods. If,
then, to take a sign which has been established for a useful end instead of the thing itself
which it was designed to signify, is bondage to the flesh, how much more so is it to take
signs intended to represent useless things for the things themselves! For even if you go back
to the very things signified by such signs, and engage your mind in the worship of these,
you will not be anything the more free from the burden and the livery of bondage to the
flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—The Jews Liberated from Their Bondage in One Way, the Gentiles in
Another.</head>
<p>12. Accordingly the liberty that comes by Christ took those whom it found under
bondage to useful signs, and who were (so to speak) near to it, and, interpreting the signs
to which they were in bondage, set them free by raising them to the realities of which these
were signs. And out of such were formed the churches of the saints of Israel. Those, on the
other hand, whom it found in bondage to useless signs, it not only freed from their slavery
to such signs, but brought to nothing and cleared out of the way all these signs themselves,
so that the Gentiles were turned from the corruption of a multitude of false gods, which
Scripture frequently and justly speaks of as fornication, to the worship of the One God: not
that they might now fall into bondage to signs of a useful kind, but rather that they might
exercise their minds in the spiritual understanding of such.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="1273"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—Who is in Bondage to Signs, and Who Not.</head>
<p>13. Now he is in bondage to a sign who uses, or pays homage to, any significant object
without knowing what it signifies: he, on the other hand, who either uses or honors a useful
sign divinely appointed, whose force and significance he understands, does not honor the
sign which is seen and temporal, but that to which all such signs refer. Now such a man is
spiritual and free even at the time of his bondage, when it is not yet expedient to reveal to
carnal minds those signs by subjection to which their carnality is to be overcome. To this
class of spiritual persons belonged the patriarchs and the prophets, and all those among the
people of Israel through whose instrumentality the Holy Spirit ministered unto us the aids
and consolations of the Scriptures. But at the present time, after that the proof of our liberty
has shone forth so clearly in the resurrection of our Lord, we are not oppressed with the
heavy burden of attending even to those signs which we now understand, but our Lord
Himself, and apostolic practice, have handed down to us a few rites in place of many, and
these at once very easy to perform, most majestic in their significance, and most sacred in
the observance; such, for example, as the sacrament of baptism, and the celebration of the
body and blood of the Lord. And as soon as any one looks upon these observances he knows
to what they refer, and so reveres them not in carnal bondage, but in spiritual freedom.
Now, as to follow the letter, and to take signs for the things that are signified by them, is a
mark of weakness and bondage; so to interpret signs wrongly is the result of being misled
by error. He, however, who does not understand what a sign signifies, but yet knows that
it is a sign, is not in bondage. And it is better even to be in bondage to unknown but useful
signs than, by interpreting them wrongly, to draw the neck from under the yoke of bondage
only to insert it in the coils of error.</p>

<pb n="1274"/>
<head>Chapter 10.—How We are to Discern Whether a Phrase is Figurative.</head>
<p>14. But in addition to the foregoing rule, which guards us against taking a metaphorical
form of speech as if it were literal, we must also pay heed to that which tells us not to take
a literal form of speech as if it were figurative. In the first place, then, we must show the
way to find out whether a phrase is literal or figurative. And the way is certainly as follows:
Whatever there is in the word of God that cannot, when taken literally, be referred either
to purity of life or soundness of doctrine, you may set down as figurative. Purity of life has
reference to the love of God and one’s neighbor; soundness of doctrine to the knowledge
of God and one’s neighbor. Every man, moreover, has hope in his own conscience, so far
as he perceives that he has attained to the love and knowledge of God and his neighbor.
Now all these matters have been spoken of in the first book.</p>
<p>15. But as men are prone to estimate sins, not by reference to their inherent sinfulness,
but rather by reference to their own customs, it frequently happens that a man will think
nothing blameable except what the men of his own country and time are accustomed to
condemn, and nothing worthy of praise or approval except what is sanctioned by the custom
of his companions; and thus it comes to pass, that if Scripture either enjoins what is opposed
to the customs of the hearers, or condemns what is not so opposed, and if at the same time
the authority of the word has a hold upon their minds, they think that the expression is
figurative. Now Scripture enjoins nothing except charity, and condemns nothing except
lust, and in that way fashions the lives of men. In the same way, if an erroneous opinion
has taken possession of the mind, men think that whatever Scripture asserts contrary to this
must be figurative. Now Scripture asserts nothing but the catholic faith, in regard to things
past, future, and present. It is a narrative of the past, a prophecy of the future, and a description
of the present. But all these tend to nourish and strengthen charity, and to overcome
and root out lust.</p>
<p>16. I mean by charity that affection of the mind which aims at the enjoyment of God
for His own sake, and the enjoyment of one’s self and one’s neighbor in subordination to
God; by lust I mean that affection of the mind which aims at enjoying one’s self and one’s
neighbor, and other corporeal things, without reference to God. Again, what lust, when
unsubdued, does towards corrupting one’s own soul and body, is called vice;1859 but what
it does to injure another is called crime.1860 And these are the two classes into which all
sins may be divided. But the vices come first; for when these have exhausted the soul, and
reduced it to a kind of poverty, it easily slides into crimes, in order to remove hindrances
to, or to find assistance in, its vices. In the same way, what charity does with a view to one’s
own advantage is prudence; but what it does with a view to a neighbor’s advantage is called
<note type="footnote">1859 Flagitium.</note>
<note type="footnote">1860 Facinus.</note>

<pb n="1275"/>
benevolence. And here prudence comes first; because no one can confer an advantage on
another which he does not himself possess. Now in proportion as the dominion of lust is
pulled down, in the same proportion is that of charity built up.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Rule for Interpreting Phrases Which Seem to Ascribe Severity to God
and the Saints.</head>
<p>17. Every severity, therefore, and apparent cruelty, either in word or deed, that is ascribed
in Holy Scripture to God or His saints, avails to the pulling down of the dominion of lust.
And if its meaning be clear, we are not to give it some secondary reference, as if it were
spoken figuratively. Take, for example, that saying of the apostle: “But, after thy hardness
and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation
of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to
them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality,
eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.”1861 But this is addressed to those who, being
unwilling to subdue their lust, are themselves involved in the destruction of their lust. When,
however, the dominion of lust is overturned in a man over whom it had held sway, this plain
expression is used: “They that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts.”1862 Only that, even in these instances, some words are used figuratively, as for example,
“the wrath of God” and “crucified.” But these are not so numerous, nor placed in
such a way as to obscure the sense, and make it allegorical or enigmatical, which is the kind
of expression properly called figurative. But in the saying addressed to Jeremiah, “See, I
have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down,
and to destroy, and to throw down,”1863 there is no doubt the whole of the language is figurative,
and to be referred to the end I have spoken of.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Rule for Interpreting Those Sayings and Actions Which are Ascribed
to God and the Saints, and Which Yet Seem to the Unskillful to Be Wicked.</head>
<p>18. Those things, again, whether only sayings or whether actual deeds, which appear
to the inexperienced to be sinful, and which are ascribed to God, or to men whose holiness
is put before us as an example, are wholly figurative, and the hidden kernel of meaning they
contain is to be picked out as food for the nourishment of charity. Now, whoever uses
transitory objects less freely than is the custom of those among whom he lives, is either
temperate or superstitious; whoever, on the other hand, uses them so as to transgress the
bounds of the custom of the good men about him, either has a further meaning in what he
does, or is sinful. In all such matters it is not the use of the objects, but the lust of the user,
that is to blame. Nobody in his sober senses would believe, for example, that when our
Lord’s feet were anointed by the woman with precious ointment,1864 it was for the same
purpose for which luxurious and profligate men are accustomed to have theirs anointed in
those banquets which we abhor. For the sweet odor means the good report which is earned
by a life of good works; and the man who wins this, while following in the footsteps of Christ,
anoints His feet (so to speak) with the most precious ointment. And so that which in the
case of other persons is often a sin, becomes, when ascribed to God or a prophet, the sign
of some great truth. Keeping company with a harlot, for example, is one thing when it is
the result of abandoned manners, another thing when done in the course of his prophecy
by the prophet Hosea.1865 Because it is a shamefully wicked thing to strip the body naked
at a banquet among the drunken and licentious, it does not follow that it is a sin to be naked
in the baths.</p>
<p>19. We must, therefore, consider carefully what is suitable to times and places and
persons, and not rashly charge men with sins. For it is possible that a wise man may use
the daintiest food without any sin of epicurism or gluttony, while a fool will crave for the
vilest food with a most disgusting eagerness of appetite. And any sane man would prefer
eating fish after the manner of our Lord, to eating lentiles after the manner of Esau, or barley
after the manner of oxen. For there are several beasts that feed on commoner kinds of food,
but it does not follow that they are more temperate than we are. For in all matters of this
kind it is not the nature of the things we use, but our reason for using them, and our manner
of seeking them, that make what we do either praiseworthy or blameable.</p>
<p>20. Now the saints of ancient times were, under the form of an earthly kingdom, foreshadowing
and foretelling the kingdom of heaven. And on account of the necessity for a
numerous offspring, the custom of one man having several wives was at that time blameless:
and for the same reason it was not proper for one woman to have several husbands, because
<note type="footnote">1864 John xii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">1865 Hos. i. 2.</note>

<pb n="1278"/>
a woman does not in that way become more fruitful, but, on the contrary, it is base harlotry
to seek either gain or offspring by promiscuous intercourse. In regard to matters of this
sort, whatever the holy men of those times did without lust, Scripture passes over without
blame, although they did things which could not be done at the present time, except through
lust. And everything of this nature that is there narrated we are to take not only in its historical
and literal, but also in its figurative and prophetical sense, and to interpret as bearing
ultimately upon the end of love towards God or our neighbor, or both. For as it was disgraceful
among the ancient Romans to wear tunics reaching to the heels, and furnished with
sleeves, but now it is disgraceful for men honorably born not to wear tunics of that description:
so we must take heed in regard to other things also, that lust do not mix with our use
of them; for lust not only abuses to wicked ends the customs of those among whom we live,
but frequently also transgressing the bounds of custom, betrays, in a disgraceful outbreak,
its own hideousness, which was concealed under the cover of prevailing fashions.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Error of Those Who Think that There is No Absolute Right and Wrong.</head>
<p>22. But when men unacquainted with other modes of life than their own meet with the
record of such actions, unless they are restrained by authority, they look upon them as sins,
and do not consider that their own customs either in regard to marriage, or feasts, or dress,
or the other necessities and adornments of human life, appear sinful to the people of other
nations and other times. And, distracted by this endless variety of customs, some who were
half asleep (as I may say)—that is, who were neither sunk in the deep sleep of folly, nor were
able to awake into the light of wisdom—have thought that there was no such thing as absolute
right, but that every nation took its own custom for right; and that, since every nation has
a different custom, and right must remain unchangeable, it becomes manifest that there is
no such thing as right at all. Such men did not perceive, to take only one example, that the
precept, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,”1866
cannot be altered by any diversity of national customs. And this precept, when it is referred
to the love of God, destroys all vices when to the love of one’s neighbor, puts an end to all
crimes. For no one is willing to defile his own dwelling; he ought not, therefore, to defile
the dwelling of God, that is, himself. And no one wishes an injury to be done him by another;
he himself, therefore, ought not to do injury to another.</p>

<p>23. The tyranny of lust being thus overthrown, charity reigns through its supremely
just laws of love to God for His own sake, and love to one’s self and one’s neighbor for God’s
sake. Accordingly, in regard to figurative expressions, a rule such as the following will be
observed, to carefully turn over in our minds and meditate upon what we read till an interpretation
be found that tends to establish the reign of love. Now, if when taken literally it

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<pb n="1282"/>
<head>Chapter 16.—Rule for Interpreting Commands and Prohibitions.</head>
<p>24. If the sentence is one of command, either forbidding a crime or vice, or enjoining
an act of prudence or benevolence, it is not figurative. If, however, it seems to enjoin a crime
or vice, or to forbid an act of prudence or benevolence, it is figurative. “Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man,” says Christ, “and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.”1867 This
seems to enjoin a crime or a vice; it is therefore a figure, enjoining that we should have a
share in the sufferings of our Lord, and that we should retain a sweet and profitable memory
of the fact that His flesh was wounded and crucified for us. Scripture says: “If thine enemy
hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink;” and this is beyond doubt a command to do
a kindness. But in what follows, “for in so doing thou shall heap coals of fire on his head,”1868
one would think a deed of malevolence was enjoined. Do not doubt, then, that the expression
is figurative; and, while it is possible to interpret it in two ways, one pointing to the doing
of an injury, the other to a display of superiority, let charity on the contrary call you back
to benevolence, and interpret the coals of fire as the burning groans of penitence by which
a man’s pride is cured who bewails that he has been the enemy of one who came to his assistance
in distress. In the same way, when our Lord says, “He who loveth his life shall lose
it,”1869 we are not to think that He forbids the prudence with which it is a man’s duty to
care for his life, but that He says in a figurative sense, “Let him lose his life”—that is, let him
destroy and lose that perverted and unnatural use which he now makes of his life, and
through which his desires are fixed on temporal things so that he gives no heed to eternal.
It is written: “Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner.”1870 The latter clause of this
sentence seems to forbid benevolence; for it says, “help not a sinner.” Understand, therefore,
that “sinner” is put figuratively for sin, so that it is his sin you are not to help.</p>

<p>25. Again, it often happens that a man who has attained, or thinks he has attained, to
a higher grade of spiritual life, thinks that the commands given to those who are still in the
lower grades are figurative; for example, if he has embraced a life of celibacy and made
himself a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, he contends that the commands given
in Scripture about loving and ruling a wife are not to be taken literally, but figuratively; and
if he has determined to keep his virgin unmarried, he tries to put a figurative interpretation
on the passage where it is said, “Marry thy daughter, and so shall thou have performed a
weighty matter.”1871 Accordingly, another of our rules for understanding the Scriptures
will be as follows,—to recognize that some commands are given to all in common, others
to particular classes of persons, that the medicine may act not only upon the state of health
as a whole, but also upon the special weakness of each member. For that which cannot be
raised to a higher state must be cared for in its own state.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—We Must Take into Consideration the Time at Which Anything Was
Enjoyed or Allowed.</head>
<p>26. We must also be on our guard against supposing that what in the Old Testament,
making allowance for the condition of those times, is not a crime or a vice even if we take
it literally and not figuratively, can be transferred to the present time as a habit of life. For
no one will do this except lust has dominion over him, and endeavors to find support for
itself in the very Scriptures which were intended to overthrow it. And the wretched man
does not perceive that such matters are recorded with this useful design, that men of good
hope may learn the salutary lesson, both that the custom they spurn can be turned to a good
use, and that which they embrace can be used to condemnation, if the use of the former be
accompanied with charity, and the use of the latter with lust.</p>
<p>27. For, if it was possible for one man to use many wives with chastity, it is possible for
another to use one wife with lust. And I look with greater approval on the man who uses
the fruitfulness of many wives for the sake of an ulterior object, than on the man who enjoys
the body of one wife for its own sake. For in the former case the man aims at a useful object
suited to the circumstances of the times; in the latter case he gratifies a lust which is engrossed
in temporal enjoyments. And those men to whom the apostle permitted as a matter of indulgence
to have one wife because of their incontinence,1872 were less near to God than
those who, though they had each of them numerous wives, yet just as a wise man uses food
and drink only for the sake of bodily health, used marriage only for the sake of offspring.
And, accordingly, if these last had been still alive at the advent of our Lord, when the time
not of casting stones away but of gathering them together had come,1873 they would have
immediately made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. For there is no
difficulty in abstaining unless when there is lust in enjoying. And assuredly those men of
whom I speak knew that wantonness even in regard to wives is abuse and intemperance, as
is proved by Tobit’s prayer when he was married to his wife. For he says: “Blessed art Thou,
O God of our fathers, and blessed is Thy holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens
bless Thee, and all Thy creatures. Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an
helper and stay. . . . And now, O Lord, Thou knowest that I take not this my sister for lust,
but uprightly: therefore have pity on us, O Lord.”1874</p>

<p>28. But those who, giving the rein to lust, either wander about steeping themselves in
a multitude of debaucheries, or even in regard to one wife not only exceed the measure necessary
for the procreation of children, but with the shameless licence of a sort of slavish
freedom heap up the filth of a still more beastly excess, such men do not believe it possible
that the men of ancient times used a number of wives with temperance, looking to nothing
but the duty, necessary in the circumstances of the time, of propagating the race; and what
they themselves, who are entangled in the meshes of lust, do not accomplish in the case of
a single wife, they think utterly impossible in the case of a number of wives.</p>
<p>29. But these same men might say that it is not right even to honor and praise good
and holy men, because they themselves when they are honored and praised, swell with pride,
becoming the more eager for the emptiest sort of distinction the more frequently and the
more widely they are blown about on the tongue of flattery, and so become so light that a
breath of rumor, whether it appear prosperous or adverse, will carry them into the whirlpool
of vice or dash them on the rocks of crime. Let them, then, learn how trying and difficult
it is for themselves to escape either being caught by the bait of praise, or pierced by the stings
of insult; but let them not measure others by their own standard.</p>

<p>Let them believe, on the contrary, that the apostles of our faith were neither puffed up
when they were honored by men, nor cast down when they were despised. And certainly
neither sort of temptation was wanting to those great men. For they were both cried up by
the loud praises of believers, and cried down by the slanderous reports of their persecutors.
But the apostles used all these things, as occasion served, and were not corrupted; and in
the same way the saints of old used their wives with reference to the necessities of their own
times, and were not in bondage to lust as they are who refuse to believe these things.</p>
<p>30. For if they had been under the influence of any such passion, they could never have
restrained themselves from implacable hatred towards their sons, by whom they knew that
their wives and concubines were solicited and debauched.</p>

<pb n="1287"/>
<head>Chapter 21.—David Not Lustful, Though He Fell into Adultery.</head>
<p>But when King David had suffered this injury at the hands of his impious and unnatural
son, he not only bore with him in his mad passion, but mourned over him in his death. He
certainly was not caught in the meshes of carnal jealousy, seeing that it was not his own injuries
but the sins of his son that moved him. For it was on this account he had given orders
that his son should not be slain if he were conquered in battle, that he might have a place
of repentance after he was subdued; and when he was baffled in this design, he mourned
over his son’s death, not because of his own loss, but because he knew to what punishment
so impious an adulterer and parricide had been hurried.1875 For prior to this, in the case
of another son who had been guilty of no crime, though he was dreadfully afflicted for him
while he was sick, yet he comforted himself after his death.1876</p>
<p>31. And with what moderation and self-restraint those men used their wives appears
chiefly in this, that when this same king, carried away by the heat of passion and by temporal
prosperity, had taken unlawful possession of one woman, whose husband also he ordered
to be put to death, he was accused of his crime by a prophet, who, when he had come to
show him his sin, set before him the parable of the poor man who had but one ewe-lamb,
and whose neighbor, though he had many, yet when a guest came to him spared to take of
his own flock, but set his poor neighbor’s one lamb before his guest to eat. And David’s
anger being kindled against the man, he commanded that he should be put to death, and
the lamb restored fourfold to the poor man; thus unwittingly condemning the sin he had
wittingly committed.1877 And when he had been shown this, and God’s punishment had
been denounced against him, he wiped out his sin in deep penitence. But yet in this parable
it was the adultery only that was indicated by the poor man’s ewe-lamb; about the killing
of the woman’s husband,—that is, about the murder of the poor man himself who had the
one ewe-lamb,—nothing is said in the parable, so that the sentence of condemnation is
pronounced against the adultery alone. And hence we may understand with what temperance
he possessed a number of wives when he was forced to punish himself for transgressing in
regard to one woman. But in his case the immoderate desire did not take up its abode with
him, but was only a passing guest. On this account the unlawful appetite is called even by
the accusing prophet, a guest. For he did not say that he took the poor man’s ewe-lamb to
make a feast for his king, but for his guest. In the case of his son Solomon, however, this
lust did not come and pass away like a guest, but reigned as a king. And about him Scripture
is not silent, but accuses him of being a lover of strange women; for in the beginning of his

to teach him not to dare to vaunt himself in his own good deeds, and in comparison with
his own righteousness, to despise others as sinners, when he sees in the case of men so eminent
both the storms that are to be avoided and the shipwrecks that are to be wept over.
For the sins of these men were recorded to this end, that men might everywhere and always
tremble at that saying of the apostle: “Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take
heed lest he fall.”1879 For there is hardly a page of Scripture on which it is not clearly written
that God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.1880</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—The Character of the Expressions Used is Above All to Have Weight.</head>
<p>34. The chief thing to be inquired into, therefore, in regard to any expression that we
are trying to understand is, whether it is literal or figurative. For when it is ascertained to
be figurative, it is easy, by an application of the laws of things which we discussed in the
first book, to turn it in every way until we arrive at a true interpretation, especially when we
bring to our aid experience strengthened by the exercise of piety. Now we find out whether
an expression is literal or figurative by attending to the considerations indicated above.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
<pb n="1292"/>
<head>Chapter 25.—The Same Word Does Not Always Signify the Same Thing.</head>
<p>And when it is shown to be figurative, the words in which it is expressed will be found
to be drawn either from like objects or from objects having some affinity.</p>
<p>35. But as there are many ways in which things show a likeness to each other, we are
not to suppose there is any rule that what a thing signifies by similitude in one place it is to
be taken to signify in all other places. For our Lord used leaven both in a bad sense, as when
He said, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees,”1881 and in a good sense, as when He said,
“The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
of meal, till the whole was leavened.”1882</p>
<p>36. Now the rule in regard to this variation has two forms. For things that signify now
one thing and now another, signify either things that are contrary, or things that are only
different. They signify contraries, for example, when they are used metaphorically at one
time in a good sense, at another in a bad, as in the case of the leaven mentioned above.
Another example of the same is that a lion stands for Christ in the place where it is said,
“The lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed;”1883 and again, stands for the devil where it
is written, “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may
devour.”1884 In the same way the serpent is used in a good sense, “Be wise as serpents;”1885
and again, in a bad sense, “The serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty.”1886 Bread is used
in a good sense, “I am the living bread which came down from heaven;”1887 in a bad, “Bread
eaten in secret is pleasant.”1888 And so in a great many other cases. The examples I have
adduced are indeed by no means doubtful in their signification, because only plain instances
ought to be used as examples. There are passages, however, in regard to which it is uncertain
in what sense they ought to be taken, as for example, “In the hand of the Lord there is a cup,
and the wine is red: it is full of mixture.”1889 Now it is uncertain whether this denotes the
wrath of God, but not to the last extremity of punishment, that is, “to the very dregs;” or
whether it denotes the grace of the Scriptures passing away from the Jews and coming to
the Gentiles, because “He has put down one and set up another,”—certain observances,
however, which they understand in a carnal manner, still remaining among the Jews, for

being taken, not in opposite, but only in different significations: water denotes people, as
we read in the Apocalypse,1890 and also the Holy Spirit, as for example, “Out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water;”1891 and many other things besides water must be interpreted
according to the place in which they are found.</p>
<p>37. And in the same way other objects are not single in their signification, but each one
of them denotes not two only but sometimes even several different things, according to the

is no better way of understanding the words addressed to God, “Take hold of shield and
buckler and stand up for mine help,”1892 than by referring to the passage where we read,
“Thou, Lord, hast crowned us with Thy favor as with a shield.”1893 And yet we are not so
to understand it, as that wherever we meet with a shield put to indicate a protection of any
kind, we must take it as signifying nothing but the favor of God. For we hear also of the
shield of faith, “wherewith,” says the apostle, “ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts
of the wicked.”1894 Nor ought we, on the other hand, in regard to spiritual armor of this
kind to assign faith to the shield only; for we read in another place of the breastplate of faith:
“putting on,” says the apostle, “the breastplate of faith and love.”1895</p>

upon the same words of Scripture, even though the meaning the writer intended remain
undiscovered, there is no danger if it can be shown from other passages of Scripture that
any of the interpretations put on the words is in harmony with the truth. And if a man in
searching the Scriptures endeavors to get at the intention of the author through whom the
Holy Spirit spoke, whether he succeeds in this endeavor, or whether he draws a different
meaning from the words, but one that is not opposed to sound doctrine, he is free from
blame so long as he is supported by the testimony of some other passage of Scripture. For
the author perhaps saw that this very meaning lay in the words which we are trying to interpret;
and assuredly the Holy Spirit, who through him spoke these words, foresaw that this
interpretation would occur to the reader, nay, made provision that it should occur to him,
seeing that it too is founded on truth. For what more liberal and more fruitful provision
could God have made in regard to the Sacred Scriptures than that the same words might be
understood in several senses, all of which are sanctioned by the concurring testimony of
other passages equally divine?</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—The Knowledge of Tropes is Necessary.</head>
<p>40. Moreover, I would have learned men to know that the authors of our Scriptures
use all those forms of expression which grammarians call by the Greek name tropes, and
use them more freely and in greater variety than people who are unacquainted with the
Scriptures, and have learnt these figures of speech from other writings, can imagine or believe.
Nevertheless those who know these tropes recognize them in Scripture, and are very
much assisted by their knowledge of them in understanding Scripture. But this is not the
place to teach them to the illiterate, lest it might seem that I was teaching grammar. I certainly
advise, however, that they be learnt elsewhere, although indeed I have already given that
advice above, in the second book—namely, where I treated of the necessary knowledge of
languages. For the written characters from which grammar itself gets its name (the Greek
name for letters being γράμματα are the signs of sounds made by the articulate voice with
which we speak. Now of some of these figures of speech we find in Scripture not only examples
(which we have of them all), but the very names as well: for instance, allegory, enigma,
and parable. However, nearly all these tropes which are said to be learnt as a matter of liberal
education are found even in the ordinary speech of men who have learnt no grammar,
but are content to use the vulgar idiom. For who does not say, “So may you flourish?” And
this is the figure of speech called metaphor. Who does not speak of a fish-pond1896 in which
there is no fish, which was not made for fish, and yet gets its name from fish? And this is
the figure called catachresis.</p>
<p>41. It would be tedious to go over all the rest in this way; for the speech of the vulgar
makes use of them all, even of those more curious figures which mean the very opposite of
what they say, as for example, those called irony and antiphrasis. Now in irony we indicate
by the tone of voice the meaning we desire to convey; as when we say to a man who is behaving
badly, “You are doing well.” But it is not by the tone of voice that we make an antiphrasis
to indicate the opposite of what the words convey; but either the words in which it
is expressed are used in the opposite of their etymological sense, as a grove is called lucus
from its want of light;1897 or it is customary to use a certain form of expression, although
it puts yes for no by a law of contraries, as when we ask in a place for what is not there, and
get the answer, “There is plenty;” or we add words that make it plain we mean the opposite
of what we say, as in the expression, “Beware of him, for he is a good man.” And what illit-

about either the nature or the names of these figures of speech? And yet the knowledge of
these is necessary for clearing up the difficulties of Scripture; because when the words taken
literally give an absurd meaning, we ought forthwith to inquire whether they may not be
used in this or that figurative sense which we are unacquainted with; and in this way many
obscure passages have had light thrown upon them.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—The Rules of Tichonius the Donatist Examined.</head>
<p>42. One Tichonius, who, although a Donatist himself, has written most triumphantly
against the Donatists (and herein showed himself of a most inconsistent disposition, that
he was unwilling to give them up altogether), wrote a book which he called the Book of
Rules, because in it he laid down seven rules, which are, as it were, keys to open the secrets
of Scripture. And of these rules, the first relates to the Lord and His body, the second to the
twofold division of the Lord’s body, the third to the promises and the law, the fourth to
species and genus, the fifth to times, the sixth to recapitulation, the seventh to the devil and
his body. Now these rules, as expounded by their author, do indeed, when carefully considered,
afford considerable assistance in penetrating the secrets of the sacred writings; but
still they do not explain all the difficult passages, for there are several other methods required,
which are so far from being embraced in this number of seven, that the author himself explains
many obscure passages without using any of his rules; finding, indeed, that there was
no need for them, as there was no difficulty in the passage of the kind to which his rules
apply. As, for example, he inquires what we are to understand in the Apocalypse by the
seven angels of the churches to whom John is commanded to write; and after much and
various reasoning, arrives at the conclusion that the angels are the churches themselves.
And throughout this long and full discussion, although the matter inquired into is certainly
very obscure, no use whatever is made of the rules. This is enough for an example, for it
would be too tedious and troublesome to collect all the passages in the canonical Scriptures
which present obscurities of such a kind as require none of these seven rules for their elucidation.</p>
<p>43. The author himself, however, when commending these rules, attributes so much
value to them that it would appear as if, when they were thoroughly known and duly applied,
we should be able to interpret all the obscure passages in the law—that is, in the sacred
books. For he thus commences this very book: “Of all the things that occur to me, I consider
none so necessary as to write a little book of rules, and, as it were, to make keys for, and put
windows in, the secret places of the law. For there are certain mystical rules which hold the
key to the secret recesses of the whole law, and render visible the treasures of truth that are
to many invisible. And if this system of rules be received as I communicate it, without
jealousy, what is shut shall be laid open, and what is obscure shall be elucidated, so that a
man travelling through the vast forest of prophecy shall, if he follow these rules as pathways
of light, be preserved from going astray.” Now, if he had said, “There are certain mystical
rules which hold the key to some of the secrets of the law,” or even “which hold the key to
the great secrets of the law,” and not what he does say, “the secret recesses of the whole law;”
and if he had not said “What is shut shall be laid open,” but, “Many things that are shut
shall be laid open,” he would have said what was true, and he would not, by attributing more
than is warranted by the facts to his very elaborate and useful work, have led the reader into

<pb n="1300"/>
false expectations. And I have thought it right to say thus much, in order both that the book
may be read by the studious (for it is of very great assistance in understanding Scripture),
and that no more may be expected from it than it really contains. Certainly it must be read
with caution, not only on account of the errors into which the author falls as a man, but
chiefly on account of the heresies which he advances as a Donatist. And now I shall briefly
indicate what these seven rules teach or advise.</p>

<pb n="1301"/>
<head>Chapter 31.—The First Rule of Tichonius.</head>
<p>44. The first is about the Lord and His body, and it is this, that, knowing as we do that
the head and the body—that is, Christ and His Church—are sometimes indicated to us under
one person (for it is not in vain that it is said to believers, “Ye then are Abraham’s seed,”1898
when there is but one seed of Abraham, and that is Christ), we need not be in a difficulty
when a transition is made from the head to the body or from the body to the head, and yet
no change made in the person spoken of. For a single person is represented as saying, “He
hath decked me as a bridegroom with ornaments, and adorned me as a bride with jewels”1899
and yet it is, of course, a matter for interpretation which of these two refers to the head and
which to the body, that is, which to Christ and which to the Church.</p>

<pb n="1302"/>
<head>Chapter 32.—The Second Rule of Tichonius.</head>
<p>45. The second rule is about the twofold division of the body of the Lord; but this indeed
is not a suitable name, for that is really no part of the body of Christ which will not be with
Him in eternity. We ought, therefore, to say that the rule is about the true and the mixed
body of the Lord, or the true and the counterfeit, or some such name; because, not to speak
of eternity, hypocrites cannot even now be said to be in Him, although they seem to be in
His Church. And hence this rule might be designated thus: Concerning the mixed Church.
Now this rule requires the reader to be on his guard when Scripture, although it has now
come to address or speak of a different set of persons, seems to be addressing or speaking
of the same persons as before, just as if both sets constituted one body in consequence of
their being for the time united in a common participation of the sacraments. An example
of this is that passage in the Song of Solomon, “I am black, but comely, as the tents of Kedar,
as the curtains of Solomon.”1900 For it is not said, I was black as the tents of Kedar, but am
now comely as the curtains of Solomon. The Church declares itself to be at present both;
and this because the good fish and the bad are for the time mixed up in the one net.1901
For the tents of Kedar pertain to Ishmael, who “shall not be heir with the son of the free
woman.”1902 And in the same way, when God says of the good part of the Church, “I will
bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight: these things
will I do unto them, and not forsake them;”1903 He immediately adds in regard to the other
part, the bad that is mixed with the good, “They shall be turned back.” Now these words
refer to a set of persons altogether different from the former; but as the two sets are for the
present united in one body, He speaks as if there were no change in the subject of the sentence.
They will not, however, always be in one body; for one of them is that wicked servant
of whom we are told in the gospel, whose lord, when he comes, “shall cut him asunder and
appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.”1904</p>

<head>Chapter 33.—The Third Rule of Tichonius.</head>
<p>46. The third rule relates to the promises and the law, and may be designated in other
terms as relating to the spirit and the letter, which is the name I made use of when writing
a book on this subject. It may be also named, of grace and the law. This, however, seems
to me to be a great question in itself, rather than a rule to be applied to the solution of other
questions. It was the want of clear views on this question that originated, or at least greatly
aggravated, the Pelagian heresy. And the efforts of Tichonius to clear up this point were
good, but not complete. For, in discussing the question about faith and works, he said that
works were given us by God as the reward of faith, but that faith itself was so far our own
that it did not come to us from God; not keeping in mind the saying of the apostle: “Peace
be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”1905
But he had not come into contact with this heresy, which has arisen in our time, and has
given us much labor and trouble in defending against it the grace of God which is through
our Lord Jesus Christ, and which (according to the saying of the apostle, “There must be
also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among
you”1906) has made us much more watchful and diligent to discover in Scripture what escaped
Tichonius, who, having no enemy to guard against, was less attentive and anxious on this
point, namely, that even faith itself is the gift of Him who “hath dealt to every man the
measure of faith.”1907 Whence it is said to certain believers: “Unto you it is given, in the
behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.”1908 Who, then,
can doubt that each of these is the gift of God, when he learns from this passage, and believes,
that each of them is given? There are many other testimonies besides which prove this. But
I am not now treating of this doctrine. I have, however, dealt with it, one place or another,
very frequently.</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—The Fourth Rule of Tichonius.</head>
<p>47. The fourth rule of Tichonius is about species and genus. For so he calls it, intending
that by species should be understood a part, by genus the whole of which that which he calls
species is a part: as, for example, every single city is a part of the great society of nations:
the city he calls a species, all nations constitute the genus. There is no necessity for here
applying that subtilty of distinction which is in use among logicians, who discuss with great
acuteness the difference between a part and a species. The rule is of course the same, if
anything of the kind referred to is found in Scripture, not in regard to a single city, but in
regard to a single province, or tribe, or kingdom. Not only, for example, about Jerusalem,
or some of the cities of the Gentiles, such as Tyre or Babylon, are things said in Scripture
whose significance oversteps the limits of the city, and which are more suitable when applied
to all nations; but in regard to Judea also, and Egypt, and Assyria, or any other nation you
choose to take which contains numerous cities, but still is not the whole world, but only a
part of it, things are said which pass over the limits of that particular country, and apply
more fitly to the whole of which this is a part; or, as our author terms it, to the genus of
which this is a species. And hence these words have come to be commonly known, so that
even uneducated people understand what is laid down specially, and what generally, in any
given Imperial command. The same thing occurs in the case of men: things are said of
Solomon, for example, the scope of which reaches far beyond him, and which are only
properly understood when applied to Christ and His Church, of which Solomon is a part.1909</p>
<p>48. Now the species is not always overstepped, for things are often said of such a kind
as evidently apply to it also, or perhaps even to it exclusively. But when Scripture, having
up to a certain point been speaking about the species, makes a transition at that point from
the species to the genus, the reader must then be carefully on his guard against seeking in
the species what he can find much better and more surely in the genus. Take, for example,
what the prophet Ezekiel says: “When the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled
it by their own way, and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a
removed woman. Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed
upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it: and I scattered them
among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way,
and according to their doings, I judged them.”1910 Now it is easy to understand that this
applies to that house of Israel of which the apostle says, “Behold Israel after the flesh;”1911
because the people of Israel after the flesh did both perform and endure all that is here referred
to. What immediately follows, too, may be understood as applying to the same

<note type="footnote">1910 Ezek. xxxvi. 17–19.</note>
<note type="footnote">1911 1 Cor. x. 18.</note>

<pb n="1305"/>
people. But when the prophet begins to say, “And I will sanctify my great name, which was
profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen
shall know that I am the Lord,”1912 the reader ought now carefully to observe the way in
which the species is overstepped and the genus taken in. For he goes on to say: “And I shall
be sanctified in you before their eyes. For I will take you from among the heathen, and
gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then will I sprinkle
clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols,
will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you;
and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh.
And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep
my commandments, and do them. And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. I will also save you from all your uncleannesses.”
1913 Now that this is a prophecy of the New Testament, to which pertain not only
the remnant of that one nation of which it is elsewhere said, “For though the number of the
children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall be saved,”1914 but
also the other nations which were promised to their fathers and our fathers; and that there
is here a promise of that washing of regeneration which, as we see, is now imparted to all
nations, no one who looks into the matter can doubt. And that saying of the apostle, when
he is commending the grace of the New Testament and its excellence in comparison with
the Old, “Ye are our epistle . . . written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God;
not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart,”1915 has an evident reference to this
place where the prophet says, “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart
of flesh.”1916 Now the heart of flesh from which the apostle’s expression, “the fleshy tables
of the heart,” is drawn, the prophet intended to point out as distinguished from the stony
heart by the possession of sentient life; and by sentient he understood intelligent life. And
thus the spiritual Israel is made up, not of one nation, but of all the nations which were
promised to the fathers in their seed, that is, in Christ.</p>
<p>49. This spiritual Israel, therefore, is distinguished from the carnal Israel which is of
one nation, by newness of grace, not by nobility of descent, in feeling, not in race; but the
prophet, in his depth of meaning, while speaking of the carnal Israel, passes on, without
indicating the transition, to speak of the spiritual, and although now speaking of the latter,

<pb n="1306"/>
seems to be still speaking of the former; not that he grudges us the clear apprehension of
Scripture, as if we were enemies, but that he deals with us as a physician, giving us a
wholesome exercise for our spirit. And therefore we ought to take this saying, “And I will
bring you into your own land,” and what he says shortly afterwards, as if repeating himself,
“And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers,” not literally, as if they referred
to Israel after the flesh, but spiritually, as referring to the spiritual Israel. For the Church,
without spot or wrinkle, gathered out of all nations, and destined to reign for ever with
Christ, is itself the land of the blessed, the land of the living; and we are to understand that
this was given to the fathers when it was promised to them for what the fathers believed
would be given in its own time was to them, on account of the unchangeableness of the
promise and purpose, the same as if it were already given; just as the apostle, writing to
Timothy, speaks of the grace which is given to the saints: “Not according to our works, but
according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
world began; but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour.”1917 He speaks of
the grace as given at a time when those to whom it was to be given were not yet in existence;
because he looks upon that as having been already done in the arrangement and purpose
of God, which was to take place in its own time, and he himself speaks of it as now made
manifest. It is possible, however, that these words may refer to the land of the age to come,
when there will be a new heaven and a new earth, wherein the unrighteous shall be unable
to dwell. And so it is truly said to the righteous, that the land itself is theirs, no part of which
will belong to the unrighteous; because it is the same as if it were itself given, when it is
firmly settled that it shall be given.</p>

<pb n="1307"/>
<head>Chapter 35.—The Fifth Rule of Tichonius.</head>
<p>50. The fifth rule Tichonius lays down is one he designates of times,—a rule by which
we can frequently discover or conjecture quantities of time which are not expressly mentioned
in Scripture. And he says that this rule applies in two ways: either to the figure of speech
called synecdoche, or to legitimate numbers. The figure synecdoche either puts the part for
the whole, or the whole for the part. As, for example, in reference to the time when, in the
presence of only three of His disciples, our Lord was transfigured on the mount, so that His
face shone as the sun, and His raiment was white as snow, one evangelist says that this event
occurred “after eight days,”1918 while another says that it occurred “after six days.”1919
Now both of these statements about the number of days cannot be true, unless we suppose
that the writer who says “after eight days,” counted the latter part of the day on which Christ
uttered the prediction and the first part of the day on which he showed its fulfillment as two
whole days; while the writer who says “after six days,” counted only the whole unbroken
days between these two. This figure of speech, which puts the part for the whole, explains
also the great question about the resurrection of Christ. For unless to the latter part of the
day on which He suffered we join the previous night, and count it as a whole day, and to
the latter part of the night in which He arose we join the Lord’s day which was just dawning,
and count it also a whole day, we cannot make out the three days and three nights during
which He foretold that He would be in the heart of the earth.1920</p>
<p>51. In the next place, our author calls those numbers legitimate which Holy Scripture
more highly favors such as seven, or ten, or twelve, or any of the other numbers which the
diligent reader of Scripture soon comes to know. Now numbers of this sort are often put
for time universal; as for example, “Seven times in the day do I praise Thee,” means just the
same as “His praise shall continually be in my mouth.”1921 And their force is exactly the
same, either when multiplied by ten, as seventy and seven hundred (whence the seventy
years mentioned in Jeremiah may be taken in a spiritual sense for the whole time during
which the Church is a sojourner among aliens);1922 or when multiplied into themselves, as
ten into ten gives one hundred, and twelve into twelve gives one hundred and forty-four,

<pb n="1308"/>
which last number is used in the Apocalypse to signify the whole body of the saints.1923
Hence it appears that it is not merely questions about times that are to be settled by these
numbers, but that their significance is of much wider application, and extends to many
subjects. That number in the Apocalypse, for example, mentioned above, has not reference
to times, but to men.</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—The Sixth Rule of Tichonius.</head>
<p>52. The sixth rule Tichonius calls the recapitulation, which, with sufficient watchfulness,
is discovered in difficult parts of Scripture. For certain occurrences are so related, that the
narrative appears to be following the order of time, or the continuity of events, when it really
goes back without mentioning it to previous occurrences, which had been passed over in
their proper place. And we make mistakes if we do not understand this, from applying the
rule here spoken of. For example, in the book of Genesis we read, “And the Lord God
planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. And
out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and
good for food.”1924 Now here it seems to be indicated that the events last mentioned took
place after God had formed man and put him in the garden; whereas the fact is, that the
two events having been briefly mentioned, viz., that God planted a garden, and there put
the man whom He had formed, the narrative goes back, by way of recapitulation, to tell
what had before been omitted, the way in which the garden was planted: that out of the
ground God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. Here
there follows, “The tree of life also was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge
of good and evil.” Next the river is mentioned which watered the garden, and which was
parted into four heads, the sources of four streams; and all this has reference to the arrangements
of the garden. And when this is finished, there is a repetition of the fact which had
been already told, but which in the strict order of events came after all this: “And the Lord
God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden.”1925 For it was after all these
other things were done that man was put in the garden, as now appears from the order of
the narrative itself: it was not after man was put there that the other things were done, as
the previous statement might be thought to imply, did we not accurately mark and understand
the recapitulation by which the narrative reverts to what had previously been passed
over.</p>
<p>53. In the same book, again, when the generations of the sons of Noah are recounted,
it is said: “These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their
countries, and in their nations.”1926 And, again, when the sons of Shem are enumerated:
“These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after
their nations.”1927 And it is added in reference to them all: “These are the families of the
sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided

<note type="footnote">1927 Gen. x. 31.</note>

<pb n="1310"/>
in the earth after the flood. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.”1928
Now the addition of this sentence, “And the whole earth was of one language and of one
speech,” seems to indicate that at the time when the nations were scattered over the earth
they had all one language in common; but this is evidently inconsistent with the previous
words, “in their families, after their tongues.” For each family or nation could not be said
to have its own language if all had one language in common. And so it is by way of recapitulation
it is added, “And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech,” the narrative
here going back, without indicating the change, to tell how it was, that from having
one language in common, the nations were divided into a multitude of tongues. And, accordingly,
we are forthwith told of the building of the tower, and of this punishment being
there laid upon them as the judgment of God upon their arrogance; and it was after this
that they were scattered over the earth according to their tongues.</p>
<p>54. This recapitulation is found in a still more obscure form; as, for example, our Lord
says in the gospel: “The same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire from heaven,
and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
In that day, he which shall be upon the house-top, and his stuff in the house, let him not
come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember
Lot’s wife.”1929 Is it when our Lord shall have been revealed that men are to give
heed to these sayings, and not to look behind them, that is, not to long after the past life
which they have renounced? Is not the present rather the time to give heed to them, that
when the Lord shall have been revealed every man may receive his reward according to the
things he has given heed to or despised? And yet because Scripture says, “In that day,” the
time of the revelation of the Lord will be thought the time for giving heed to these sayings,
unless the reader be watchful and intelligent so as to understand the recapitulation, in which
he will be assisted by that other passage of Scripture which even in the time of the apostles
proclaimed: “Little children, it is the last time.”1930 The very time then when the gospel is
preached, up to the time that the Lord shall be revealed, is the day in which men ought to
give heed to these sayings: for to the same day, which shall be brought to a close by a day
of judgment, belongs that very revelation of the Lord here spoken of.1931</p>

<head>Chapter 37.—The Seventh Rule of Tichonius.</head>
<p>55. The seventh rule of Tichonius and the last, is about the devil and his body. For he
is the head of the wicked, who are in a sense his body, and destined to go with him into the
punishment of everlasting fire, just as Christ is the head of the Church, which is His body,
destined to be with Him in His eternal kingdom and glory. Accordingly, as the first rule,
which is called of the Lord and His body, directs us, when Scripture speaks of one and the
same person, to take pains to understand which part of the statement applies to the head
and which to the body; so this last rule shows us that statements are sometimes made about
the devil, whose truth is not so evident in regard to himself as in regard to his body; and his
body is made up not only of those who are manifestly out of the way, but of those also who,
though they really belong to him, are for a time mixed up with the Church, until they depart
from this life, or until the chaff is separated from the wheat at the last great winnowing.
For example, what is said in Isaiah, “How he is fallen from heaven, Lucifer, son of the
morning!”1932 and the other statements of the context which, under the figure of the king
of Babylon, are made about the same person, are of course to be understood of the devil;
and yet the statement which is made in the same place, “He is ground down on the earth,
who sendeth to all nations,”1933 does not altogether fitly apply to the head himself. For, although
the devil sends his angels to all nations, yet it is his body, not himself, that is ground
down on the each, except that he himself is in his body, which is beaten small like the dust
which the wind blows from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>56. Now all these rules, except the one about the promises and the law, make one
meaning to be understood where another is expressed, which is the peculiarity of figurative
diction; and this kind of diction, it seems to me, is too widely spread to be comprehended
in its full extent by any one. For, wherever one thing is said with the intention that another
should be understood we have a figurative expression, even though the name of the trope
is not to be found in the art of rhetoric. And when an expression of this sort occurs where
it is customary to find it, there is no trouble in understanding it; when it occurs, however,
where it is not customary, it costs labor to understand it, from some more, from some less,
just as men have got more or less from God of the gifts of intellect, or as they have access
to more or fewer external helps. And, as in the case of proper words which I discussed
above, and in which things are to be understood just as they are expressed, so in the case of
figurative words, in which one thing is expressed and another is to be understood, and which
I have just finished speaking of as much as I thought enough, students of these venerable
documents ought to be counselled not only to make themselves acquainted with the forms
of expression ordinarily used in Scripture, to observe them carefully, and to remember them

understand them. For in these very books on the study of which they are intent, they read,
“The Lord giveth wisdom: out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding;”1934
and it is from Him they have received their very desire for knowledge, if it is wedded to
piety. But about signs, so far as relates to words, I have now said enough. It remains to
discuss, in the following book, so far as God has given me light, the means of communicating
our thoughts to others.</p>

<p>Argument—Passing to the second part of his work, that which treats of expression, the
author premises that it is no part of his intention to write a treatise on the laws of rhetoric.
These can be learned elsewhere, and ought not to be neglected, being indeed specially necessary
for the Christian teacher, whom it behoves to excel in eloquence and power of speech. After
detailing with much care and minuteness the various qualities of an orator, he recommends
the authors of the Holy Scriptures as the best models of eloquence, far excelling all others in
the combination of eloquence with wisdom. He points out that perspicuity is the most essential
quality of style, and ought to be cultivated with especial care by the teacher, as it is the main
requisite for instruction, although other qualities are required for delighting and persuading
the hearer. All these gifts are to be sought in earnest prayer from God, though we are not to
forget to be zealous and diligent in study. He shows that there are three species of style, the
subdued, the elegant, and the majestic; the first serving for instruction, the second for praise,
and the third for exhortation: and of each of these he gives examples, selected both from
scripture and from early teachers of the church, Cyprian and Ambrose. He shows that these
various styles may be mingled, and when and for what purposes they are mingled; and that
they all have the same end in view, to bring home the truth to the hearer, so that he may understand
it, hear it with gladness, and practise it in his life. Finally, he exhorts the Christian
teacher himself, pointing out the dignity and responsibility of the office he holds to lead a life
in harmony with his own teaching, and to show a good example to all.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—This Work Not Intended as a Treatise on Rhetoric.</head>
<p>1. This work of mine, which is entitled On Christian Doctrine, was at the commencement
divided into two parts. For, after a preface, in which I answered by anticipation those who
were likely to take exception to the work, I said, “There are two things on which all interpretation
of Scripture depends: the mode of ascertaining the proper meaning, and the mode
of making known the meaning when it is ascertained. I shall treat first of the mode of ascertaining,
next of the mode of making known, the meaning.”1935 As, then, I have already said
a great deal about the mode of ascertaining the meaning, and have given three books to this
one part of the subject, I shall only say a few things about the mode of making known the
meaning, in order if possible to bring them all within the compass of one book, and so finish
the whole work in four books.</p>
<p>2. In the first place, then, I wish by this preamble to put a stop to the expectations of
readers who may think that I am about to lay down rules of rhetoric such as I have learnt,
and taught too, in the secular schools, and to warn them that they need not look for any
such from me. Not that I think such rules of no use, but that whatever use they have is to
be learnt elsewhere; and if any good man should happen to have leisure for learning them,
he is not to ask me to teach them either in this work or any other.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—It is Lawful for a Christian Teacher to Use the Art of Rhetoric.</head>
<p>3. Now, the art of rhetoric being available for the enforcing either of truth or falsehood,
who will dare to say that truth in the person of its defenders is to take its stand unarmed
against falsehood? For example, that those who are trying to persuade men of what is false
are to know how to introduce their subject, so as to put the hearer into a friendly, or attentive,
or teachable frame of mind, while the defenders of the truth shall be ignorant of that art?
That the former are to tell their falsehoods briefly, clearly, and plausibly, while the latter
shall tell the truth in such a way that it is tedious to listen to, hard to understand, and, in
fine, not easy to believe it? That the former are to oppose the truth and defend falshood
with sophistical arguments, while the latter shall be unable either to defend what it true, or
to refute what is false? That the former, while imbuing the minds of their hearers with erroneous
opinions, are by their power of speech to awe, to melt, to enliven, and to rouse them,
while the latter shall in defence of the truth be sluggish, and frigid, and somnolent? Who
is such a fool as to think this wisdom? Since, then, the faculty of eloquence is available for
both sides, and is of very great service in the enforcing either of wrong or right, why do not
good men study to engage it on the side of truth, when bad men use it to obtain the triumph
of wicked and worthless causes, and to further injustice and error?</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—The Proper Age and the Proper Means for Acquiring Rhetorical Skill.</head>
<p>4. But the theories and rules on this subject (to which, when you add a tongue thoroughly
skilled by exercise and habit in the use of many words and many ornaments of speech, you
have what is called eloquence or oratory) may be learnt apart from these writings of mine,
if a suitable space of time be set aside for the purpose at a fit and proper age. But only by
those who can learn them quickly; for the masters of Roman eloquence themselves did not
shrink from saying that any one who cannot learn this art quickly can never thoroughly
learn it at all.1936 Whether this be true or not, why need we inquire? For even if this art
can occasionally be in the end mastered by men of slower intellect, I do not think it of so
much importance as to wish men who have arrived at mature age to spend time in learning
it. It is enough that boys should give attention to it; and even of these, not all who are to be
fitted for usefulness in the Church, but only those who are not yet engaged in any occupation
of more urgent necessity, or which ought evidently to take precedence of it. For men of
quick intellect and glowing temperament find it easier to become eloquent by reading and
listening to eloquent speakers than by following rules for eloquence. And even outside the
canon, which to our great advantage is fixed in a place of secure authority, there is no want
of ecclesiastical writings, in reading which a man of ability will acquire a tinge of the eloquence
with which they are written, even though he does not aim at this, but is solely intent
on the matters treated of; especially, of course, if in addition he practise himself in writing,
or dictating, and at last also in speaking, the opinions he has formed on grounds of piety
and faith. If, however, such ability be wanting, the rules of rhetoric are either not understood,
or if, after great labor has been spent in enforcing them, they come to be in some small
measure understood, they prove of no service. For even those who have learnt them, and
who speak with fluency and elegance, cannot always think of them when they are speaking
so as to speak in accordance with them, unless they are discussing the rules themselves.
Indeed, I think there are scarcely any who can do both things—that is, speak well, and, in
order to do this, think of the rules of speaking while they are speaking. For we must be
careful that what we have got to say does not escape us whilst we are thinking about saying
it according to the rules of art. Nevertheless, in the speeches of eloquent men, we find rules
of eloquence carried out which the speakers did not think of as aids to eloquence at the time
when they were speaking, whether they had ever learnt them, or whether they had never
even met with them. For it is because they are eloquent that they exemplify these rules; it
is not that they use them in order to be eloquent.</p>
<note type="footnote">1936 Cicero de Oratore, iii. 31; Quinctil, Inst. Orat. i. 1, 2.</note>

<pb n="1317"/>
<p>5. And, therefore, as infants cannot learn to speak except by learning words and phrases
from those who do speak, why should not men become eloquent without being taught any
art of speech, simply by reading and learning the speeches of eloquent men, and by imitating
them as far as they can? And what do we find from the examples themselves to be the case
in this respect? We know numbers who, without acquaintance with rhetorical rules, are
more eloquent than many who have learnt these; but we know no one who is eloquent
without having read and listened to the speeches and debates of eloquent men. For even
the art of grammar, which teaches correctness of speech, need not be learnt by boys, if they
have the advantage of growing up and living among men who speak correctly. For without
knowing the names of any of the faults, they will, from being accustomed to correct speech,
lay hold upon whatever is faulty in the speech of any one they listen to, and avoid it; just as
city-bred men, even when illiterate, seize upon the faults of rustics.</p>

<head>Chapter 4.—The Duty of the Christian Teacher.</head>
<p>6. It is the duty, then, of the interpreter and teacher of Holy Scripture, the defender of
the true faith and the opponent of error, both to teach what is right and to refute what is
wrong, and in the performance of this task to conciliate the hostile, to rouse the careless,
and to tell the ignorant both what is occurring at present and what is probable in the future.
But once that his hearers are friendly, attentive, and ready to learn, whether he has found
them so, or has himself made them so, the remaining objects are to be carried out in whatever
way the case requires. If the hearers need teaching, the matter treated of must be made fully
known by means of narrative. On the other hand, to clear up points that are doubtful requires
reasoning and the exhibition of proof. If, however, the hearers require to be roused rather
than instructed, in order that they may be diligent to do what they already know, and to
bring their feelings into harmony with the truths they admit, greater vigor of speech is
needed. Here entreaties and reproaches, exhortations and upbraidings, and all the other
means of rousing the emotions, are necessary.</p>
<p>7. And all the methods I have mentioned are constantly used by nearly every one in
cases where speech is the agency employed.</p>

<head>Chapter 5.—Wisdom of More Importance Than Eloquence to the Christian Teacher.</head>
<p>But as some men employ these coarsely, inelegantly, and frigidly, while others use them
with acuteness, elegance, and spirit, the work that I am speaking of ought to be undertaken
by one who can argue and speak with wisdom, if not with eloquence, and with profit to his
hearers, even though he profit them less than he would if he could speak with eloquence
too. But we must beware of the man who abounds in eloquent nonsense, and so much the
more if the hearer is pleased with what is not worth listening to, and thinks that because the
speaker is eloquent what he says must be true. And this opinion is held even by those who
think that the art of rhetoric should be taught; for they confess that “though wisdom without
eloquence is of little service to states, yet eloquence without wisdom is frequently a positive
injury, and is of service never.”1937 If, then, the men who teach the principles of eloquence
have been forced by truth to confess this in the very books which treat of eloquence, though
they were ignorant of the true, that is, the heavenly wisdom which comes down from the
Father of Lights, how much more ought we to feel it who are the sons and the ministers of
this higher wisdom! Now a man speaks with more or less wisdom just as he has made more
or less progress in the knowledge of Scripture; I do not mean by reading them much and
committing them to memory, but by understanding them aright and carefully searching
into their meaning. For there are who read and yet neglect them; they read to remember
the words, but are careless about knowing the meaning. It is plain we must set far above
these the men who are not so retentive of the words, but see with the eyes of the heart into
the heart of Scripture. Better than either of these, however, is the man who, when he wishes,
can repeat the words, and at the same time correctly apprehends their meaning.</p>
<p>8. Now it is especially necessary for the man who is bound to speak wisely, even though
he cannot speak eloquently, to retain in memory the words of Scripture. For the more he
discerns the poverty of his own speech, the more he ought to draw on the riches of Scripture,
so that what he says in his own words he may prove by the words of Scripture; and he himself,
though small and weak in his own words, may gain strength and power from the confirming
testimony of great men. For his proof gives pleasure when he cannot please by his mode of
speech. But if a man desire to speak not only with wisdom, but with eloquence also (and
assuredly he will prove of greater service if he can do both), I would rather send him to
read, and listen to, and exercise himself in imitating, eloquent men, than advise him to spend
time with the teachers of rhetoric; especially if the men he reads and listens to are justly
praised as having spoken, or as being accustomed to speak, not only with eloquence, but
with wisdom also. For eloquent speakers are heard with pleasure; wise speakers with profit.
And, therefore, Scripture does not say that the multitude of the eloquent, but “the multitude
<note type="footnote">1937 Cicero, de Inventione Rhetorica i. 1.</note>

<pb n="1320"/>
of the wise is the welfare of the world.”1938 And as we must often swallow wholesome bitters,
so we must always avoid unwholesome sweets. But what is better than wholesome sweetness
or sweet wholesomeness? For the sweeter we try to make such things, the easier it is to make
their wholesomeness serviceable. And so there are writers of the Church who have expounded
the Holy Scriptures, not only with wisdom, but with eloquence as well; and there
is not more time for the reading of these than is sufficient for those who are studious and
at leisure to exhaust them.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—The Sacred Writers Unite Eloquence with Wisdom.</head>
<p>9. Here, perhaps, some one inquires whether the authors whose divinely-inspired
writings constitute the canon, which carries with it a most wholesome authority, are to be
considered wise only, or eloquent as well. A question which to me, and to those who think
with me, is very easily settled. For where I understand these writers, it seems to me not only
that nothing can be wiser, but also that nothing can be more eloquent. And I venture to
affirm that all who truly understand what these writers say, perceive at the same time that
it could not have been properly said in any other way. For as there is a kind of eloquence
that is more becoming in youth, and a kind that is more becoming in old age, and nothing
can be called eloquence if it be not suitable to the person of the speaker, so there is a kind
of eloquence that is becoming in men who justly claim the highest authority, and who are
evidently inspired of God. With this eloquence they spoke; no other would have been suitable
for them; and this itself would be unsuitable in any other, for it is in keeping with their
character, while it mounts as far above that of others (not from empty inflation, but from
solid merit) as it seems to fall below them. Where, however, I do not understand these
writers, though their eloquence is then less apparent, I have no doubt but that it is of the
same kind as that I do understand. The very obscurity, too, of these divine and wholesome
words was a necessary element in eloquence of a kind that was designed to profit our understandings,
not only by the discovery of truth, but also by the exercise of their powers.</p>
<p>10. I could, however, if I had time, show those men who cry up their own form of language
as superior to that of our authors (not because of its majesty, but because of its inflation),
that all those powers and beauties of eloquence which they make their boast, are to
be found in the sacred writings which God in His goodness has provided to mould our
characters, and to guide us from this world of wickedness to the blessed world above. But
it is not the qualities which these writers have in common with the heathen orators and
poets that give me such unspeakable delight in their eloquence; I am more struck with admiration
at the way in which, by an eloquence peculiarly their own, they so use this eloquence
of ours that it is not conspicuous either by its presence or its absence: for it did not become
them either to condemn it or to make an ostentatious display of it; and if they had shunned
it, they would have done the former; if they had made it prominent, they might have appeared
to be doing the latter. And in those passages where the learned do note its presence, the
matters spoken of are such, that the words in which they are put seem not so much to be
sought out by the speaker as spontaneously to suggest themselves; as if wisdom were walking
out of its house,—that is, the breast of the wise man, and eloquence, like an inseparable attendant,
followed it without being called for.1939</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—Examples of True Eloquence Drawn from the Epistles of Paul and the
Prophecies of Amos.</head>
<p>11. For who would not see what the apostle meant to say, and how wisely he has said
it, in the following passage: “We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh
patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed;
because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us”?1940 Now were any man unlearnedly learned (if I may use the expression) to contend
that the apostle had here followed the rules of rhetoric, would not every Christian, learned
or unlearned, laugh at him? And yet here we find the figure which is called in Greek κλίμαζ
(climax,) and by some in Latin gradatio, for they do not care to call it scala (a ladder), when
the words and ideas have a connection of dependency the one upon the other, as we see
here that patience arises out of tribulation, experience out of patience, and hope out of experience.
Another ornament, too, is found here; for after certain statements finished in a
single tone of voice, which we call clauses and sections (membra et cæsa), but the Greeks
κῶλα and κόμματα,1941 there follows a rounded sentence (ambitus sive circuitus) which the
Greeks call περίοδος,1942 the clauses of which are suspended on the voice of the speaker till
the whole is completed by the last clause. For of the statements which precede the period,
this is the first clause, “knowing that tribulation worketh patience;” the second, “and patience,
experience;” the third, “and experience, hope.” Then the period which is subjoined is
completed in three clauses, of which the first is, “and hope maketh not ashamed;” the second,
“because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts;” the third, “by the Holy Ghost which
is given unto us.” But these and other matters of the same kind are taught in the art of
elocution. As then I do not affirm that the apostle was guided by the rules of eloquence, so
I do not deny that his wisdom naturally produced, and was accompanied by, eloquence.</p>
<p>12. In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, again, he refutes certain false apostles who
had gone out from the Jews, and had been trying to injure his character; and being compelled
to speak of himself, though he ascribes this as folly to himself, how wisely and how eloquently
he speaks! But wisdom is his guide, eloquence his attendant; he follows the first, the second
follows him, and yet he does not spurn it when it comes after him. “I say again,” he says,
“Let no man think me a fool: if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself
a little. That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this

confidence of boasting. Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. For ye suffer
fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage,
if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the
face. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit, whereinsoever
any is bold (I speak foolishly), I am bold also. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites?
so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as
a fool), I am more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more
frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one, thrice was I
beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have
been in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by
mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,
in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in
watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Besides those
things which are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? If I must needs glory,
I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.”1943 The thoughtful and attentive
perceive how much wisdom there is in these words. And even a man sound asleep must
notice what a stream of eloquence flows through them.</p>
<p>13. Further still, the educated man observes that those sections which the Greeks call
κόμματα, and the clauses and periods of which I spoke a short time ago, being intermingled
in the most beautiful variety, make up the whole form and features (so to speak) of that
diction by which even the unlearned are delighted and affected. For, from the place where
I commenced to quote, the passage consists of periods: the first the smallest possible, consisting
of two members; for a period cannot have less than two members, though it may
have more: “I say again, let no man think me a fool.” The next has three members: “if
otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.” The third has four
members: “That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this
confidence of boasting.” The fourth has two: “Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will
glory also.” And the fifth has two: “For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.”
The sixth again has two members: “for ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage.” Then
follow three sections (cæsa): “if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt
himself.” Next three clauses (membra): if “a man smite you on the face. I speak as concerning
reproach, as though we had been weak.” Then is subjoined a period of three members:
“Howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold (I speak foolishly), I am bold also.” After this, certain
separate sections being put in the interrogatory form, separate sections are also given as
answers, three to three: “Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they
<note type="footnote">1943 2 Cor. xi. 16–30.</note>

<pb n="1324"/>
the seed of Abraham? so am I.” But a fourth section being put likewise in the interrogatory
form, the answer is given not in another section (cæsum) but in a clause (membrum):1944
“Are they the ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool.) I am more.” Then the next four sections
are given continuously, the interrogatory form being most elegantly suppressed: “in labors
more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.” Next is
interposed a short period; for, by a suspension of the voice, “of the Jews five times” is to be
marked off as constituting one member, to which is joined the second, “received I forty
stripes save one.” Then he returns to sections, and three are set down: “Thrice was I beaten
with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck.” Next comes a clause: “a night
and a day I have been in the deep.” Next fourteen sections burst forth with a vehemence
which is most appropriate: “In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers,
in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in
the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren, in weariness and painfulness,
in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.”
After this comes in a period of three members: “Besides those things which are without,
that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.” And to this he adds two
clauses in a tone of inquiry: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
not?” In fine, this whole passage, as if panting for breath, winds up with a period of two
members: “If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.”
And I cannot sufficiently express how beautiful and delightful it is when after this outburst
he rests himself, and gives the hearer rest, by interposing a slight narrative. For he goes on
to say: “The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth
that I lie not.” And then he tells, very briefly the danger he had been in, and the way he escaped
it.</p>
<p>14. It would be tedious to pursue the matter further, or to point out the same facts in
regard to other passages of Holy Scripture. Suppose I had taken the further trouble, at least
in regard to the passages I have quoted from the apostle’s writings, to point out figures of
speech which are taught in the art of rhetoric? Is it not more likely that serious men would
think I had gone too far, than that any of the studious would think I had done enough? All
these things when taught by masters are reckoned of great value; great prices are paid for
them, and the vendors puff them magniloquently. And I fear lest I too should smack of that
puffery while thus descanting on matters of this kind. It was necessary, however, to reply
to the ill-taught men who think our authors contemptible; not because they do not possess,
but because they do not display, the eloquence which these men value so highly.</p>
<note type="footnote">1944 The only apparent difference between membrum and cæsum is, that the former is the longer of the two.
It is impossible to express the difference in English.</note>

<pb n="1325"/>
<p>15. But perhaps some one is thinking that I have selected the Apostle Paul because he
is our great orator. For when he says, “Though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge,”1945
he seems to speak as if granting so much to his detractors, not as confessing that he recognized
its truth. If he had said, “I am indeed rude in speech, but not in knowledge,” we could
not in any way have put another meaning upon it. He did not hesitate plainly to assert his
knowledge, because without it he could not have been the teacher of the Gentiles. And
certainly if we bring forward anything of his as a model of eloquence, we take it from those
epistles which even his very detractors, who thought his bodily presence weak and his speech
contemptible, confessed to be weighty and powerful.1946</p>
<p>I see, then, that I must say something about the eloquence of the prophets also, where
many things are concealed under a metaphorical style, which the more completely they
seem buried under figures of speech, give the greater pleasure when brought to light. In
this place, however, it is my duty to select a passage of such a kind that I shall not be compelled
to explain the matter, but only to commend the style. And I shall do so, quoting
principally from the book of that prophet who says that he was a shepherd or herdsman,
and was called by God from that occupation, and sent to prophesy to the people of God.1947
I shall not, however, follow the Septuagint translators, who, being themselves under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit in their translation, seem to have altered some passages with
the view of directing the reader’s attention more particularly to the investigation of the
spiritual sense; (and hence some passages are more obscure, because more figurative, in
their translation;) but I shall follow the translation made from the Hebrew into Latin by the
presbyter Jerome, a man thoroughly acquainted with both tongues.</p>
<p>16. When, then, this rustic, or quondam rustic prophet, was denouncing the godless,
the proud, the luxurious, and therefore the most neglectful of brotherly love, he called aloud,
saying: “Woe to you who are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, who
are heads and chiefs of the people, entering with pomp into the house of Israel! Pass ye
unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of
the Philistines, and to all the best kingdoms of these: is their border greater than your border?
Ye that are set apart for the day of evil, and that come near to the seat of oppression;
that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch yourselves upon couches that eat the lamb of the
flock, and the calves out of the midst of the herd; that chant to the sound of the viol. They
thought that they had instruments of music like David; drinking wine in bowls, and
anointing themselves with the costliest ointment: and they were not grieved for the affliction

of Joseph.”1948 Suppose those men who, assuming to be themselves learned and eloquent,
despise our prophets as untaught and unskillful of speech, had been obliged to deliver a
message like this, and to men such as these, would they have chosen to express themselves
in any respect differently—those of them, at least, who would have shrunk from raving like
madmen?</p>
<p>17. For what is there that sober ears could wish changed in this speech? In the first
place, the invective itself; with what vehemence it throws itself upon the drowsy senses to
startle them into wakefulness: “Woe to you who are at ease in Zion, and trust in the
mountains of Samaria, who are heads and chiefs of the people, entering with pomp into the
house of Israel!” Next, that he may use the favors of God, who has bestowed upon them
ample territory, to show their ingratitude in trusting to the mountain of Samaria, where
idols were worshipped: “Pass ye unto Calneh,” he says, “and see; and from thence go ye to
Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines, and to all the best kingdoms of
these: is their border greater than your border?” At the same time also that these things
are spoken of, the style is adorned with names of places as with lamps, such as “Zion,”
“Samaria,” “Calneh,” “Hamath the great,” and “Gath of the Philistines.” Then the words
joined to these places are most appropriately varied: “ye are at ease,” “ye trust,” “pass on,”
“go,” “descend.”</p>
<p>18. And then the future captivity under an oppressive king is announced as approaching,
when it is added: “Ye that are set apart for the day of evil, and come near to the seat of oppression.”
Then are subjoined the evils of luxury: “ye that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch
yourselves upon couches; that eat the lamb from the flock, and the calves out of the midst
of the herd.” These six clauses form three periods of two members each. For he does not
say: Ye who are set apart for the day of evil, who come near to the seat of oppression, who
sleep upon beds of ivory, who stretch yourselves upon couches, who eat the lamb from the
flock, and calves out of the herd. If he had so expressed it, this would have had its beauty:
six separate clauses running on, the same pronoun being repeated each time, and each clause
finished by a single effort of the speaker’s voice. But it is more beautiful as it is, the clauses
being joined in pairs under the same pronoun, and forming three sentences, one referring
to the prophecy of the captivity: “Ye that are set apart for the day of evil, and come near
the seat of oppression;” the second to lasciviousness: “ye that lie upon beds of ivory, and
stretch yourselves upon couches;” the third to gluttony: “who eat the lamb from the flock,
and the calves out of the midst of the herd.” So that it is at the discretion of the speaker
whether he finish each clause separately and make six altogether, or whether he suspend
his voice at the first, the third, and the fifth, and by joining the second to the first, the fourth
<note type="footnote">1948 Amos vi. 1–6. The version given above, which is a literal translation of Jerome’s Latin, as quoted by
Augustin, differs slightly from the English authorized version.</note>

<pb n="1327"/>
to the third, and the sixth to the fifth, make three most elegant periods of two members
each: one describing the imminent catastrophe; another, the lascivious couch; and the third,
the luxurious table.</p>
<p>19. Next he reproaches them with their luxury in seeking pleasure for the sense of
hearing. And here, when he had said, “Ye who chant to the sound of the viol,” seeing that
wise men may practise music wisely, he, with wonderful skill of speech, checks the flow of
his invective, and not now speaking to, but of, these men, and to show us that we must dis-
tinguish the music of the wise from the music of the voluptuary, he does not say, “Ye who
chant to the sound of the viol, and think that ye have instruments of music like David;” but
he first addresses to themselves what it is right the voluptuaries should hear, “Ye who chant
to the sound of the viol;” and then, turning to others, he intimates that these men have not
even skill in their art: “they thought that they had instruments of music like David; drinking
wine in bowls, and anointing themselves with the costliest ointment.” These three clauses
are best pronounced when the voice is suspended on the first two members of the period,
and comes to a pause on the third.</p>
<p>20. But now as to the sentence which follows all these: “and they were not grieved for
the affliction of Joseph.” Whether this be pronounced continuously as one clause, or
whether with more elegance we hold the words, “and they were not grieved,” suspended on
the voice, and then add, “for the affliction of Joseph,” so as to make a period of two members;
in any case, it is a touch of marvelous beauty not to say, “and they were not grieved for the
affliction of their brother;” but to put Joseph for brother, so as to indicate brothers in general
by the proper name of him who stands out illustrious from among his brethren, both in
regard to the injuries he suffered and the good return he made. And, indeed, I do not know
whether this figure of speech, by which Joseph is put for brothers in general, is one of those
laid down in that art which I learnt and used to teach. But how beautiful it is, and how it
comes home to the intelligent reader, it is useless to tell any one who does not himself feel
it.</p>
<p>21. And a number of other points bearing on the laws of eloquence could be found in
this passage which I have chosen as an example. But an intelligent reader will not be so
much instructed by carefully analysing it as kindled by reciting it with spirit. Nor was it
composed by man’s art and care, but it flowed forth in wisdom and eloquence from the
Divine mind; wisdom not aiming at eloquence, yet eloquence not shrinking from wisdom.
For if, as certain very eloquent and acute men have perceived and said, the rules which are
laid down in the art of oratory could not have been observed, and noted, and reduced to
system, if they had not first had their birth in the genius of orators, is it wonderful that they
should be found in the messengers of Him who is the author of all genius? Therefore let us
acknowledge that the canonical writers are not only wise but eloquent also, with an eloquence
suited to a character and position like theirs.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.—The Obscurity of the Sacred Writers, Though Compatible with Eloquence,
Not to Be Imitated by Christian Teachers.</head>
<p>22. But although I take some examples of eloquence from those writings of theirs which
there is no difficulty in understanding, we are not by any means to suppose that it is our
duty to imitate them in those passages where, with a view to exercise and train the minds
of their readers, and to break in upon the satiety and stimulate the zeal of those who are
willing to learn, and with a view also to throw a veil over the minds of the godless either
that they may be converted to piety or shut out from a knowledge of the mysteries, from
one or other of these reasons they have expressed themselves with a useful and wholesome
obscurity. They have indeed expressed themselves in such a way that those who in after
ages understood and explained them aright have in the Church of God obtained an esteem,
not indeed equal to that with which they are themselves regarded, but coming next to it.
The expositors of these writers, then, ought not to express themselves in the same way, as
if putting forward their expositions as of the same authority; but they ought in all their deliverances
to make it their first and chief aim to be understood, using as far as possible such
clearness of speech that either he will be very dull who does not understand them, or that
if what they say should not be very easily or quickly understood, the reason will lie not in
their manner of expression, but in the difficulty and subtilty of the matter they are trying
to explain.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="1329"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—How, and with Whom, Difficult Passages are to Be Discussed.</head>
<p>23. For there are some passages which are not understood in their proper force, or are
understood with great difficulty, at whatever length, however clearly, or with whatever eloquence
the speaker may expound them; and these should never be brought before the people
at all, or only on rare occasions when there is some urgent reason. In books, however, which
are written in such a style that, if understood, they, so to speak, draw their own readers, and
if not understood, give no trouble to those who do not care to read them and in private
conversations, we must not shrink from the duty of bringing the truth which we ourselves
have reached within the comprehension of others, however difficult it may be to understand
it, and whatever labor in the way of argument it may cost us. Only two conditions are to
be insisted upon, that our hearer or companion should have an earnest desire to learn the
truth, and should have capacity of mind to receive it in whatever form it may be communicated,
the teacher not being so anxious about the eloquence as about the clearness of his
teaching.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<pb n="1330"/>
<head>Chapter 10.—The Necessity for Perspicuity of Style.</head>
<p>24. Now a strong desire for clearness sometimes leads to neglect of the more polished
forms of speech, and indifference about what sounds well, compared with what clearly expresses
and conveys the meaning intended. Whence a certain author, when dealing with
speech of this kind, says that there is in it “a kind of careful negligence.”1949 Yet while taking
away ornament, it does not bring in vulgarity of speech; though good teachers have, or ought
to have, so great an anxiety about teaching that they will employ a word which cannot be
made pure Latin without becoming obscure or ambiguous, but which when used according
to the vulgar idiom is neither ambiguous nor obscure, not in the way the learned, but rather
in the way the unlearned employ it. For if our translators did not shrink from saying, “Non
congregabo conventicula eorum de sanguinibus,”1950 because they felt that it was important
for the sense to put a word here in the plural which in Latin is only used in the singular;
why should a teacher of godliness who is addressing an unlearned audience shrink from
using ossum instead of os, if he fear that the latter might be taken not as the singular of ossa,
but as the singular of ora, seeing that African ears have no quick perception of the shortness
or length of vowels? And what advantage is there in purity of speech which does not lead
to understanding in the hearer, seeing that there is no use at all in speaking, if they do not
understand us for whose sake we speak? He, therefore, who teaches will avoid all words
that do not teach; and if instead of them he can find words which are at once pure and intelligible,
he will take these by preference; if, however, he cannot, either because there are no
such words, or because they do not at the time occur to him, he will use words that are not
quite pure, if only the substance of his thought be conveyed and apprehended in its integrity.</p>
<p>25. And this must be insisted on as necessary to our being understood, not only in
conversations, whether with one person or with several, but much more in the case of a
speech delivered in public: for in conversation any one has the power of asking a question;
but when all are silent that one may be heard, and all faces are turned attentively upon him,
it is neither customary nor decorous for a person to ask a question about what he does not
understand; and on this account the speaker ought to be especially careful to give assistance
to those who cannot ask it. Now a crowd anxious for instruction generally shows by its
movements if it understands what is said; and until some indication of this sort be given,
the subject discussed ought to be turned over and over, and put in every shape and form
and variety of expression, a thing which cannot be done by men who are repeating words
prepared beforehand and committed to memory. As soon, however, as the speaker has ascertained
that what he says is understood, he ought either to bring his address to a close, or

pass on to another point. For if a man gives pleasure when he throws light upon points on
which people wish for instruction, he becomes wearisome when he dwells at length upon
things that are already well known, especially when men’s expectation was fixed on having
the difficulties of the passage removed. For even things that are very well known are told
for the sake of the pleasure they give, if the attention be directed not to the things themselves,
but to the way in which they are told. Nay, even when the style itself is already well known,
if it be pleasing to the hearers, it is almost a matter of indifference whether he who speaks
be a speaker or a reader. For things that are gracefully written are often not only read with
delight by those who are making their first acquaintance with them, but re-read with delight
by those who have already made acquaintance with them, and have not yet forgotten them;
nay, both these classes will derive pleasure even from hearing another man repeat them.
And if a man has forgotten anything, when he is reminded of it he is taught. But I am not
now treating of the mode of giving pleasure. I am speaking of the mode in which men who
desire to learn ought to be taught. And the best mode is that which secures that he who
hears shall hear the truth, and that what he hears he shall understand. And when this point
has been reached, no further labor need be spent on the truth itself, as if it required further
explanation; but perhaps some trouble may be taken to enforce it so as to bring it home to
the heart. If it appear right to do this, it ought to be done so moderately as not to lead to
weariness and impatience.</p>

<pb n="1332"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—The Christian Teacher Must Speak Clearly, But Not Inelegantly.</head>
<p>26. For teaching, of course, true eloquence consists, not in making people like what
they disliked, nor in making them do what they shrank from, but in making clear what was
obscure; yet if this be done without grace of style, the benefit does not extend beyond the
few eager students who are anxious to know whatever is to be learnt, however rude and
unpolished the form in which it is put; and who, when they have succeeded in their object,
find the plain truth pleasant food enough. And it is one of the distinctive features of good
intellects not to love words, but the truth in words. For of what service is a golden key, if it
cannot open what we want it to open? Or what objection is there to a wooden one if it can,
seeing that to open what is shut is all we want? But as there is a certain analogy between
learning and eating, the very food without which it is impossible to live must be flavored to
meet the tastes of the majority.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="1333"/>
<head>Chapter 12.—The Aim of the Orator, According to Cicero, is to Teach, to Delight,
and to Move. Of These, Teaching is the Most Essential.</head>
<p>27. Accordingly a great orator has truly said that “an eloquent man must speak so as
to teach, to delight, and to persuade.”1951 Then he adds: “To teach is a necessity, to delight
is a beauty, to persuade is a triumph.”1952 Now of these three, the one first mentioned, the
teaching, which is a matter of necessity, depends on what we say; the other two on the way
we say it. He, then, who speaks with the purpose of teaching should not suppose that he
has said what he has to say as long as he is not understood; for although what he has said
be intelligible to himself it is not said at all to the man who does not understand it. If,
however, he is understood, he has said his say, whatever may have been his manner of saying
it. But if he wishes to delight or persuade his hearer as well, he will not accomplish that end
by putting his thought in any shape no matter what, but for that purpose the style of
speaking is a matter of importance. And as the hearer must be pleased in order to secure
his attention, so he must be persuaded in order to move him to action. And as he is pleased
if you speak with sweetness and elegance, so he is persuaded if he be drawn by your promises,
and awed by your threats; if he reject what you condemn, and embrace what you commend;
if he grieve when you heap up objects for grief, and rejoice when you point out an object
for joy; if he pity those whom you present to him as objects of pity, and shrink from those
whom you set before him as men to be feared and shunned. I need not go over all the other
things that can be done by powerful eloquence to move the minds of the hearers, not telling
them what they ought to do, but urging them to do what they already know ought to be
done.</p>
<p>28. If, however, they do not yet know this, they must of course be instructed before
they can be moved. And perhaps the mere knowledge of their duty will have such an effect
that there will be no need to move them with greater strength of eloquence. Yet when this
is needful, it ought to be done. And it is needful when people, knowing what they ought to
do, do it not. Therefore, to teach is a necessity. For what men know, it is in their own hands
either to do or not to do. But who would say that it is their duty to do what they do not
know? On the same principle, to persuade is not a necessity: for it is not always called for;
as, for example, when the hearer yields his assent to one who simply teaches or gives pleasure.
For this reason also to persuade is a triumph, because it is possible that a man may be taught
and delighted, and yet not give his consent. And what will be the use of gaining the first
two ends if we fail in the third? Neither is it a necessity to give pleasure; for when, in the
course of an address, the truth is clearly pointed out (and this is the true function of teaching),
1951 Cicero, Orator. 21: “Est igitur eloquens qui ita dicet, ut probei, ut delectet, ut flectat.” Not quoted accurately
by Augustin.
<note type="footnote">1952 “Probare, necessitatis est; delectare, suavitatis; flectere, victoriæ.”</note>

<pb n="1334"/>
it is not the fact, nor is it the intention, that the style of speech should make the truth
pleasing, or that the style should of itself give pleasure; but the truth itself, when exhibited
in its naked simplicity, gives pleasure, because it is the truth. And hence even falsities are
frequently a source of pleasure when they are brought to light and exposed. It is not, of
course, their falsity that gives pleasure; but as it is true that they are false, the speech which
shows this to be true gives pleasure.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="1335"/>
<head>Chapter 13.—The Hearer Must Be Moved as Well as Instructed.</head>
<p>29. But for the sake of those who are so fastidious that they do not care for truth unless
it is put in the form of a pleasing discourse, no small place has been assigned in eloquence
to the art of pleasing. And yet even this is not enough for those stubborn-minded men who
both understand and are pleased with the teacher’s discourse, without deriving any profit
from it. For what does it profit a man that he both confesses the truth and praises the eloquence,
if he does not yield his consent, when it is only for the sake of securing his consent
that the speaker in urging the truth gives careful attention to what he says? If the truths
taught are such that to believe or to know them is enough, to give one’s assent implies
nothing more than to confess that they are true. When, however, the truth taught is one
that must be carried into practice, and that is taught for the very purpose of being practiced,
it is useless to be persuaded of the truth of what is said, it is useless to be pleased with the
manner in which it is said, if it be not so learnt as to be practiced. The eloquent divine, then,
when he is urging a practical truth, must not only teach so as to give instruction, and please
so as to keep up the attention, but he must also sway the mind so as to subdue the will. For
if a man be not moved by the force of truth, though it is demonstrated to his own confession,
and clothed in beauty of style, nothing remains but to subdue him by the power of eloquence.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Beauty of Diction to Be in Keeping with the Matter.</head>
<p>30. And so much labor has been spent by men on the beauty of expression here spoken
of, that not only is it not our duty to do, but it is our duty to shun and abhor, many and
heinous deeds of wickedness and baseness which wicked and base men have with great
eloquence recommended, not with a view to gaining assent, but merely for the sake of being
read with pleasure. But may God avert from His Church what the prophet Jeremiah says
of the synagogue of the Jews: “A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land:
the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests applaud them with their hands;1953 and my
people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?”1954 O eloquence, which
is the more terrible from its purity, and the more crushing from its solidity! Assuredly it is
“a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces.” For to this God Himself has by the same
prophet compared His own word spoken through His holy prophets.1955 God forbid, then,
God forbid that with us the priest should applaud the false prophet, and that God’s people
should love to have it so. God forbid, I say, that with us there should be such terrible madness!
For what shall we do in the end thereof? And assuredly it is preferable, even though
what is said should be less intelligible, less pleasing, and less persuasive, that truth be spoken,
and that what is just, not what is iniquitous, be listened to with pleasure. But this, of course,
cannot be, unless what is true and just be expressed with elegance.</p>
<p>31. In a serious assembly, moreover, such as is spoken of when it is said, “I will praise
Thee among much people,”1956 no pleasure is derived from that species of eloquence which
indeed says nothing that is false, but which buries small and unimportant truths under a
frothy mass of ornamental words, such as would not be graceful or dignified even if used
to adorn great and fundamental truths. And something of this sort occurs in a letter of the
blessed Cyprian, which, I think, came there by accident, or else was inserted designedly with
this view, that posterity might see how the wholesome discipline of Christian teaching had
cured him of that redundancy of language, and confined him to a more dignified and
modest form of eloquence, such as we find in his subsequent letters, a style which is admired
without effort, is sought after with eagerness, but is not attained without great difficulty.
He says, then, in one place, “Let us seek this abode: the neighboring solitudes afford a retreat
where, whilst the spreading shoots of the vine trees, pendulous and intertwined, creep
amongst the supporting reeds, the leafy covering has made a portico of vine.”1957 There is
wonderful fluency and exuberance of language here; but it is too florid to be pleasing to

serious minds. But people who are fond of this style are apt to think that men who do not
use it, but employ a more chastened style, do so because they cannot attain the former, not
because their judgment teaches them to avoid it. Wherefore this holy man shows both that
he can speak in that style, for he has done so once, and that he does not choose, for he never
uses it again.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—The Christian Teacher Should Pray Before Preaching.</head>
<p>32. And so our Christian orator, while he says what is just, and holy, and good (and he
ought never to say anything else), does all he can to be heard with intelligence, with pleasure,
and with obedience; and he need not doubt that if he succeed in this object, and so far as
he succeeds, he will succeed more by piety in prayer than by gifts of oratory; and so he ought
to pray for himself, and for those he is about to address, before he attempts to speak. And
when the hour is come that he must speak, he ought, before he opens his mouth, to lift up
his thirsty soul to God, to drink in what he is about to pour forth, and to be himself filled
with what he is about to distribute. For, as in regard to every matter of faith and love there
are many things that may be said, and many ways of saying them, who knows what it is expedient
at a given moment for us to say, or to be heard saying, except God who knows the
hearts of all? And who can make us say what we ought, and in the way we ought, except
Him in whose hand both we and our speeches are? Accordingly, he who is anxious both to
know and to teach should learn all that is to be taught, and acquire such a faculty of speech
as is suitable for a divine. But when the hour for speech arrives, let him reflect upon that
saying of our Lord’s as better suited to the wants of a pious mind: “Take no thought how
or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For
it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”1958 The Holy
Spirit, then, speaks thus in those who for Christ’s sake are delivered to the persecutors; why
not also in those who deliver Christ’s message to those who are willing to learn?</p>

<head>Chapter 16.—Human Directions Not to Be Despised, Though God Makes the True
Teacher.</head>
<p>33. Now if any one says that we need not direct men how or what they should teach,
since the Holy Spirit makes them teachers, he may as well say that we need not pray, since
our Lord says, “Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask Him;”1959
or that the Apostle Paul should not have given directions to Timothy and Titus as to how
or what they should teach others. And these three apostolic epistles ought to be constantly
before the eyes of every one who has obtained the position of a teacher in the Church. In
the First Epistle to Timothy do we not read: “These things command and teach?”1960 What
these things are, has been told previously. Do we not read there: “Rebuke not an elder, but
entreat him as a father?”1961 Is it not said in the Second Epistle: “Hold fast the form of
sound words, which thou hast heard of me?”1962 And is he not be ashamed, rightly dividing
the word of truth?”1963 And in the same place: “Preach the word; be instant in season, out
of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.”1964 And so in the
Epistle to Titus, does he not say that a bishop ought to “hold fast the faithful word as he
hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the
gainsayers?”1965 There, too, he says: “But speak thou the things which become sound
doctrine: that the aged men be sober,” and so on.1966 And there, too: “These things speak,
and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. Put them in mind to
be subject to principalities and powers,”1967 and so on. What then are we to think? Does
the apostle in any way contradict himself, when, though he says that men are made teachers
by the operation of the Holy Spirit, he yet himself gives them directions how and what they
should teach? Or are we to understand, that though the duty of men to teach even the
teachers does not cease when the Holy Spirit is given, yet that neither is he who planteth
anything, nor he who watereth, but God who giveth the increase?1968 Wherefore though
holy men be our helpers, or even holy angels assist us, no one learns aright the things that

pertain to life with God, until God makes him ready to learn from Himself, that God who
is thus addressed in the psalm: “Teach me to do Thy will; for Thou art my God.”1969 And
so the same apostle says to Timothy himself, speaking, of course, as teacher to disciple: “But
continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of
whom thou hast learned them.”1970 For as the medicines which men apply to the bodies
of their fellow-men are of no avail except God gives them virtue (who can heal without their
aid, though they cannot without His), and yet they are applied; and if it be done from a sense
of duty, it is esteemed a work of mercy or benevolence; so the aids of teaching, applied
through the instrumentality of man, are of advantage to the soul only when God works to
make them of advantage, who could give the gospel to man even without the help or agency
of men.</p>

<p>34. He then who, in speaking, aims at enforcing what is good, should not despise any
of those three objects, either to teach, or to give pleasure, or to move, and should pray and
strive, as we have said above, to be heard with intelligence, with pleasure, and with ready
compliance. And when he does this with elegance and propriety, he may justly be called
eloquent, even though he do not carry with him the assent of his hearer. For it is these three
ends, viz., teaching, giving pleasure, and moving, that the great master of Roman eloquence
himself seems to have intended that the following three directions should subserve: “He,
then, shall be eloquent, who can say little things in a subdued style, moderate things in a
temperate style, and great things in a majestic style:”1971 as if he had taken in also the three
ends mentioned above, and had embraced the whole in one sentence thus: “He, then, shall
be eloquent, who can say little things in a subdued style, in order to give instruction, moderate
things in a temperate style, in order to give pleasure, and great things in a majestic
style, in order to sway the mind.”</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—The Christian Orator is Constantly Dealing with Great Matters.</head>
<p>35. Now the author I have quoted could have exemplified these three directions, as laid
down by himself, in regard to legal questions: he could not, however, have done so in regard
to ecclesiastical questions,—the only ones that an address such as I wish to give shape to is
concerned with. For of legal questions those are called small which have reference to pecuniary
transactions; those great where a matter relating to man’s life or liberty comes up.
Cases, again, which have to do with neither of these, and where the intention is not to get
the hearer to do, or to pronounce judgment upon anything, but only to give him pleasure,
occupy as it were a middle place between the former two, and are on that account called
middling, or moderate. For moderate things get their name from modus (a measure); and
it is an abuse, not a proper use of the word moderate, to put it for little. In questions like
ours, however, where all things, and especially those addressed to the people from the place
of authority, ought to have reference to men’s salvation, and that not their temporal but
their eternal salvation, and where also the thing to be guarded against is eternal ruin,
everything that we say is important; so much so, that even what the preacher says about
pecuniary matters, whether it have reference to loss or gain, whether the amount be great
or small, should not seem unimportant. For justice is never unimportant, and justice ought
assuredly to be observed, even in small affairs of money, as our Lord says: “He that is
faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much.”1972 That which is least, then, is very
little; but to be faithful in that which is least is great. For as the nature of the circle, viz., that
all lines drawn from the centre to the circumference are equal, is the same in a great disk
that it is in the smallest coin; so the greatness of justice is in no degree lessened, though the
matters to which justice is applied be small.</p>
<p>36. And when the apostle spoke about trials in regard to secular affairs (and what were
these but matters of money?), he says: “Dare any of you, having a matter against another,
go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? Do ye not know that the saints shall
judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that
pertain to this life? If, then, ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to
judge who are least esteemed in the Church. I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is
not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. Now therefore there
is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another: why do ye not rather
take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong, and
defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the

<pb n="1343"/>
kingdom of God?”1973 Why is it that the apostle is so indignant, and that he thus accuses,
and upbraids, and chides, and threatens? Why is it that the changes in his tone, so frequent
and so abrupt, testify to the depth of his emotion? Why is it, in fine, that he speaks in a tone
so exalted about matters so very trifling? Did secular matters deserve so much at his hands?
God forbid. No; but all this is done for the sake of justice, charity, and piety, which in the
judgment of every sober mind are great, even when applied to matters the very least.</p>
<p>37. Of course, if we were giving men ad vice as to how they ought to conduct secular
cases, either for themselves or for their connections, before the church courts, we would
rightly advise them to conduct them quietly as matters of little moment. But we are treating
of the manner of speech of the man who is to be a teacher of the truths which deliver us
from eternal misery and bring us to eternal happiness; and wherever these truths are spoken
of, whether in public or private, whether to one or many, whether to friends or enemies,
whether in a continuous discourse or in conversation, whether in tracts, or in books, or in
letters long or short, they are of great importance. Unless indeed we are prepared to say
that, because a cup of cold water is a very trifling and common thing, the saying of our Lord
that he who gives a cup of cold water to one of His disciples shall in no wise lose his reward,
1974 is very trivial and unimportant. Or that when a preacher takes this saying as his
text, he should think his subject very unimportant, and therefore speak without either eloquence
or power, but in a subdued and humble style. Is it not the case that when we happen
to speak on this subject to the people, and the presence of God is with us, so that what we
say is not altogether unworthy of the subject, a tongue of fire springs up out of that cold
water which inflames even the cold hearts of men with a zeal for doing works of mercy in
hope of an eternal reward?</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—The Christian Teacher Must Use Different Styles on Different Occasions.</head>
<p>38. And yet, while our teacher ought to speak of great matters, he ought not always to
be speaking of them in a majestic tone, but in a subdued tone when he is teaching, temperately
when he is giving praise or blame. When, however, something is to be done, and we are
speaking to those who ought, but are not willing, to do it, then great matters must be spoken
of with power, and in a manner calculated to sway the mind. And sometimes the same
important matter is treated in all these ways at different times, quietly when it is being taught,
temperately when its importance is being urged, and powerfully when we are forcing a mind
that is averse to the truth to turn and embrace it. For is there anything greater than God
Himself? Is nothing, then, to be learnt about Him? Or ought he who is teaching the Trinity
in unity to speak of it otherwise than in the method of calm discussion, so that in regard to
a subject which it is not easy to comprehend, we may understand as much as it is given us
to understand? Are we in this case to seek out ornaments instead of proofs? Or is the
hearer to be moved to do something instead of being instructed so that he may learn
something? But when we come to praise God, either in Himself, or in His works, what a
field for beauty and splendor of language opens up before man, who can task his powers to
the utmost in praising Him whom no one can adequately praise, though there is no one
who does not praise Him in some measure! But if He be not worshipped, or if idols,
whether they be demons or any created being whatever, be worshipped with Him or in
preference to Him, then we ought to speak out with power and impressiveness, show how
great a wickedness this is, and urge men to flee from it.</p>

<pb n="1345"/>
<head>Chapter 20.—Examples of the Various Styles Drawn from Scripture.</head>
<p>39. But now to come to something more definite. We have an example of the calm,
subdued style in the Apostle Paul, where he says: “Tell me, ye that desire to be under the
law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; the one by a bond
maid, the other by a free woman. But he who was of the bond woman was born after the
flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise. Which things are an allegory: for these are
the two covenants; the one from the Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is
Hagar. For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is,
and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the
mother of us all;”1975 and so on. And in the same way where he reasons thus: “Brethren,
I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed,
no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises
made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
Christ. And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the
law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make
the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
but God gave it to Abraham by promise.”1976 And because it might possibly occur to the
hearer to ask, If there is no inheritance by the law, why then was the law given? he himself
anticipates this objection and asks, “Wherefore then serveth the law?” And the answer is
given: “It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the
promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator
is not a mediator of one; but God is one.” And here an objection occurs which he
himself has stated: “Is the law then against the promises of God?” He answers: “God forbid.”
And he also states the reason in these words: “For if there had been a law given which could
have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the Scripture hath
concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them
that believe.”1977 It is part, then, of the duty of the teacher not only to interpret what is
obscure, and to unravel the difficulties of questions, but also, while doing this, to meet other
questions which may chance to suggest themselves, lest these should cast doubt or discredit
on what we say. If, however, the solution of these questions suggest itself as soon as the
questions themselves arise, it is useless to disturb what we cannot remove. And besides,
when out of one question other questions arise, and out of these again still others; if these
be all discussed and solved, the reasoning is extended to such a length, that unless the
memory be exceedingly powerful and active the reasoner finds it impossible to return to

<pb n="1346"/>
the original question from which he set out. It is, however, exceedingly desirable that
whatever occurs to the mind as an objection that might be urged should be stated and refuted,
lest it turn up at a time when no one will be present to answer it, or lest, if it should occur
to a man who is present but says nothing about it, it might never be thoroughly removed.</p>
<p>40. In the following words of the apostle we have the temperate style: “Rebuke not an
elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; the elder women as
mothers, the younger as sisters.”1978 And also in these: “I beseech you, therefore, brethren,
by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
God, which is you reasonable service.”1979 And almost the whole of this hortatory passage
is in the temperate style of eloquence; and those parts of it are the most beautiful in which,
as if paying what was due, things that belong to each other are gracefully brought together.
For example: “Having then gifts, differing according to the grace that is given to us,
whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us
wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation:
he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is
evil, cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love;
in honor preferring one another; not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; distributing to the
necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse
not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind
one toward another.”1980 And how gracefully all this is brought to a close in a period of
two members: “Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate!” And a little
afterwards: “Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to
whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.”1981 And these also, though expressed
in single clauses, are terminated by a period of two members: “Owe no man anything,
but to love one another.” And a little farther on: “The night is far spent, the day is at hand:
let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let us
walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness,
not in strife and envying: but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.”1982 Now if the passage were translated thus,
“et carnis providentiam ne in concupiscentiis feceritis,”1983 the ear would no doubt be gratified

with a more harmonious ending; but our translator, with more strictness, preferred to retain
even the order of the words. And how this sounds in the Greek language, in which the
apostle spoke, those who are better skilled in that tongue may determine. My opinion,
however, is, that what has been translated to us in the same order of words does not run
very harmoniously even in the original tongue.</p>
<p>41. And, indeed, I must confess that our authors are very defective in that grace of
speech which consists in harmonious endings. Whether this be the fault of the translators,
or whether, as I am more inclined to believe, the authors designedly avoided such ornament,
I dare not affirm; for I confess I do not know. This I know, however, that if any one who
is skilled in this species of harmony would take the closing sentences of these writers and
arrange them according to the law of harmony (which he could very easily do by changing
some words for words of equivalent meaning, or by retaining the words he finds and altering
their arrangement), he will learn that these divinely-inspired men are not defective in any
of those points which he has been taught in the schools of the grammarians and rhetoricians
to consider of importance; and he will find in them many kinds of speech of great
beauty,—beautiful even in our language, but especially beautiful in the original,—none of
which can be found in those writings of which they boast so much. But care must be taken
that, while adding harmony, we take away none of the weight from these divine and authoritative
utterances. Now our prophets were so far from being deficient in the musical training
from which this harmony we speak of is most fully learnt, that Jerome, a very learned man,
describes even the metres employed by some of them,1984 in the Hebrew language at least;
though, in order to give an accurate rendering of the words, he has not preserved these in
his translation. I, however (to speak of my own feeling, which is better known to me than
it is to others, and than that of others is to me), while I do not in my own speech, however
modestly I think it done, neglect these harmonious endings, am just as well pleased to find
them in the sacred authors very rarely.</p>
<p>42. The majestic style of speech differs from the temperate style just spoken of, chiefly
in that it is not so much decked out with verbal ornaments as exalted into vehemence by
mental emotion. It uses, indeed, nearly all the ornaments that the other does; but if they
do not happen to be at hand, it does not seek for them. For it is borne on by its own vehemence;
and the force of the thought, not the desire for ornament, makes it seize upon any
beauty of expression that comes in its way. It is enough for its object that warmth of feeling
should suggest the fitting words; they need not be selected by careful elaboration of speech.
If a brave man be armed with weapons adorned with gold and jewels, he works feats of valor
with those arms in the heat of battle, not because they are costly, but because they are arms;
and yet the same man does great execution, even when anger furnishes him with a weapon

that he digs out of the ground.1985 The apostle in the following passage is urging that, for
the sake of the ministry of the gospel, and sustained by the consolations of God’s grace, we
should bear with patience all the evils of this life. It is a great subject, and is treated with
power, and the ornaments of speech are not wanting: “Behold,” he says, “now is the accepted
time; behold, now is the day of salvation. Giving no offence in anything, that the ministry
not blamed: but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience,
in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in strifes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors,
in watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the
Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of
righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and
good report: as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and,
behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet
making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.”1986 See him still
burning: “O ye Corinthians, our mouth is opened unto you, our heart is enlarged,” and so
on; it would be tedious to go through it all.</p>
<p>43. And in the same way, writing to the Romans, he urges that the persecutions of this
world should be overcome by charity, in assured reliance on the help of God. And he treats
this subject with both power and beauty: “We know,” he says, “that all things work together
for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose. For
whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son,
that He might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate,
them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified,
them He also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall
He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s
elect? It is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather,
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for
us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written, For Thy sake we are killed all
the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are
more than conquerors, through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”1987</p>

<p>44. Again, in writing to the Galatians, although the whole epistle is written in the subdued
style, except at the end, where it rises into a temperate eloquence, yet he interposes
one passage of so much feeling that, notwithstanding the absence of any ornaments such
as appear in the passages just quoted, it cannot be called anything but powerful: “Ye observe
days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you
labor in vain. Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured
me at all. Ye know how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel unto you at
the first. And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received
me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for
I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes,
and have given them to me. Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the
truth? They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might
affect them. But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only
when I am present with you. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
be formed in you, I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand
in doubt of you.”1988 Is there anything here of contrasted words arranged antithetically, or
of words rising gradually to a climax, or of sonorous clauses, and sections, and periods?
Yet, notwithstanding, there is a glow of strong emotion that makes us feel the fervor of eloquence.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Examples of the Various Styles, Drawn from the Teachers of the
Church, Especially Ambrose and Cyprian.</head>
<p>45. But these writings of the apostles, though clear, are yet profound, and are so written
that one who is not content with a superficial acquaintance, but desires to know them
thoroughly, must not only read and hear them, but must have an expositor. Let us, then,
study these various modes of speech as they are exemplified in the writings of men who, by
reading the Scriptures, have attained to the knowledge of divine and saving truth, and have
ministered it to the Church. Cyprian of blessed memory writes in the subdued style in his
treatise on the sacrament of the cup. In this book he resolves the question, whether the cup
of the Lord ought to contain water only, or water mingled with wine. But we must quote a
passage by way of illustration. After the customary introduction, he proceeds to the discussion
of the point in question. “Observe” he says, “that we are instructed, in presenting the
cup, to maintain the custom handed down to us from the Lord, and to do nothing that our
Lord has not first done for us: so that the cup which is offered in remembrance of Him
should be mixed with wine. For, as Christ says, ‘I am the true vine,’1989 it follows that the
blood of Christ is wine, not water; and the cup cannot appear to contain His blood by which
we are redeemed and quickened, if the wine be absent; for by the wine is the blood of Christ
typified, that blood which is foreshadowed and proclaimed in all the types and declarations
of Scripture. For we find that in the book of Genesis this very circumstance in regard to the
sacrament is foreshadowed, and our Lord’s sufferings typically set forth, in the case of Noah,
when he drank wine, and was drunken, and was uncovered within his tent, and his nakedness
was exposed by his second son, and was carefully hidden by his elder and his younger
sons.1990 It is not necessary to mention the other circumstances in detail, as it is only necessary
to observe this point, that Noah, foreshadowing the future reality, drank, not water,
but wine, and thus showed forth our Lord’s passion. In the same way we see the sacrament
of the Lord’s supper prefigured in the case of Melchizedek the priest, according to the
testimony of the Holy Scriptures, where it says: ‘And Melchizedek king of Salem brought
forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed Abraham.’
1991 Now, that Melchizedek was a type of Christ, the Holy Spirit declares in the Psalms,
where the Father addressing the Son says, ‘Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek.’1992”1993 In this passage, and in all of the letter that follows, the subdued style
is maintained, as the reader may easily satisfy himself.</p>

<p>46. St. Ambrose also, though dealing with a question of very great importance, the
equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son, employs the subdued style, because
the object he has in view demands, not beauty of diction, nor the swaying of the mind by
the stir of emotion, but facts and proofs. Accordingly, in the introduction to his work, we
find the following passage among others: “When Gideon was startled by the message he
had heard from God, that, though thousands of the people failed, yet through one man God
would deliver His people from their enemies, he brought forth a kid of the goats, and by
direction of the angel laid it with unleavened cakes upon a rock, and poured the broth over
it; and as soon as the angel of God touched it with the end of the staff that was in his hand,
there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the offering.1994 Now this sign seems to
indicate that the rock was a type of the body of Christ, for it is written, ‘They drank of that
spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ;’1995 this, of course, referring
not to Christ’s divine nature but to His flesh, whose ever-flowing fountain of blood has ever
satisfied the hearts of His thirsting people. And so it was at that time declared in a mystery
that the Lord Jesus, when crucified, should abolish in His flesh the sins of the whole world,
and not their guilty acts merely, but the evil lusts of their hearts. For the kid’s flesh refers
to the guilt of the outward act, the broth to the allurement of lust within, as it is written,
‘And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also
wept again and again and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?’1996 When the angel, then,
stretched out his staff and touched the rock, and fire rose out of it, this was a sign that our
Lord’s flesh, filled with the Spirit of God, should burn up all the sins of the human race.
Whence also the Lord says ‘I am come to send fire on the earth.’”1997 And in the same style
he pursues the subject, devoting himself chiefly to proving and enforcing his point.1998</p>
<p>47. An example of the temperate style is the celebrated encomium on virginity from
Cyprian: “Now our discourse addresses itself to the virgins, who, as they are the objects of
higher honor, are also the objects of greater care. These are the flowers on the tree of the
Church, the glory and ornament of spiritual grace, the joy of honor and praise, a work unbroken
and unblemished, the image of God answering to the holiness of the Lord, the
brighter portion of the flock of Christ. The glorious fruitfulness of their mother the Church
rejoices in them, and in them flourishes more abundantly; and in proportion as bright virginity
adds to her numbers, in the same proportion does the mother’s joy increase.1999 And

at another place in the end of the epistle, ‘As we have borne,’ he says, ‘the image of the
earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.’2000 Virginity bears this image, integrity
bears it, holiness and truth bear it; they bear it who are mindful of the chastening of the
Lord, who observe justice and piety, who are strong in faith, humble in fear, steadfast in the
endurance of suffering, meek in the endurance of injury, ready to pity, of one mind and of
one heart in brotherly peace. And every one of these things ought ye, holy virgins, to observe,
to cherish, and fulfill, who having hearts at leisure for God and for Christ, and having chosen
the greater and better part, lead and point the way to the Lord, to whom you have pledged
your vows. Ye who are advanced in age, exercise control over the younger. Ye who are
younger, wait upon the elders, and encourage your equals; stir up one another by mutual
exhortations; provoke one another to glory by emulous examples of virtue; endure bravely,
advance in spirituality, finish your course with joy; only be mindful of us when your virginity
shall begin to reap its reward of honor.”2001</p>
<p>48. Ambrose also uses the temperate and ornamented style when he is holding up before
virgins who have made their profession a model for their imitation, and says: “She was a
virgin not in body only, but also in mind; not mingling the purity of her affection with any
dross of hypocrisy; serious in speech; prudent in disposition; sparing of words; delighting
in study; not placing her confidence in uncertain riches, but in the prayer of the poor; diligent
in labor; reverent in word; accustomed to look to God, not man, as the guide of her conscience;
injuring no one, wishing well to all; dutiful to her elders, not envious of her equals;
avoiding boastfulness, following reason, loving virtue. When did she wound her parents
even by a look? When did she quarrel with her neighbors? When did she spurn the humble,
laugh at the weak, or shun the indigent? She is accustomed to visit only those haunts of
men that pity would not blush for, nor modesty pass by. There is nothing haughty in her
eyes, nothing bold in her words, nothing wanton in her gestures: her bearing is not voluptuous,
nor her gait too free, nor her voice petulant; so that her outward appearance is an
image of her mind, and a picture of purity. For a good house ought to be known for such
at the very thres hold, and show at the very entrance that there is no dark recess within, as
the light of a lamp set inside sheds its radiance on the outside. Why need I detail her sparingness
in food, her superabundance in duty,—the one falling beneath the demands of
nature, the other rising above its powers? The latter has no intervals of intermission, the
former doubles the days by fasting; and when the desire for refreshment does arise, it is
satisfied with food such as will support life, but not minister to appetite.”2002 Now I have
cited these latter passages as examples of the temperate style, because their purpose is not

<pb n="1353"/>
to induce those who have not yet devoted themselves to take the vows of virginity, but to
show of what character those who have taken vows ought to be. To prevail on any one to
take a step of such a nature and of so great importance, requires that the mind should be
excited and set on fire by the majestic style. Cyprian the martyr, however, did not write
about the duty of taking up the profession of virginity, but about the dress and deportment
of virgins. Yet that great bishop urges them to their duty even in these respects by the power
of a majestic eloquence.</p>
<p>49. But I shall select examples of the majestic style from their treatment of a subject
which both of them have touched. Both have denounced the women who color, or rather
discolor, their faces with paint. And the first, in dealing with this topic, says: “Suppose a
painter should depict in colors that rival nature’s the features and form and complexion of
some man, and that, when the portrait had been finished with consummate art, another
painter should put his hand over it, as if to improve by his superior skill the painting already
completed; surely the first artist would feel deeply insulted, and his indignation would be
justly roused. Dost thou, then, think that thou wilt carry off with impunity so audacious
an act of wickedness, such an insult to God the great artificer? For, granting that thou art
not immodest in thy behavior towards men, and that thou art not polluted in mind by these
meretricious deceits, yet, in corrupting and violating what is God’s, thou provest thyself
worse than an adulteress. The fact that thou considerest thyself adorned and beautified by
such arts is an impeachment of God’s handiwork, and a violation of truth. Listen to the
warning voice of the apostle: ‘Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye
are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the
feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.’2003 Now can sincerity and truth continue to exist
when what is sincere is polluted, and what is true is changed by meretricious coloring and
the deceptions of quackery into a lie? Thy Lord says, ‘Thou canst not make one hair white
or black;’2004 and dost thou wish to have greater power so as to bring to nought the words
of thy Lord? With rash and sacrilegious hand thou wouldst fain change the color of thy
hair: I would that, with a prophetic look to the future, thou shouldst dye it the color of
flame.”2005 It would be too long to quote all that follows.</p>
<p>50. Ambrose again, inveighing against such practices, says: “Hence arise these incentives
to vice, that women, in their fear that they may not prove attractive to men, paint their faces
with carefully-chosen colors, and then from stains on their features go on to stains on their
chastity. What folly it is to change the features of nature into those of painting, and from

<pb n="1354"/>
fear of incurring their husband’s disapproval, to proclaim openly that they have incurred
their own! For the woman who desires to alter her natural appearance pronounces condemnation
on herself; and her eager endeavors to please another prove that she has first been
displeasing to herself. And what testimony to thine ugliness can we find, O woman, that is
more unquestionable than thine own, when thou art afraid to show thyself? If thou art
comely why dost thou hide thy comeliness? If thou art plain, why dost thou lyingly pretend
to be beautiful, when thou canst not enjoy the pleasure of the lie either in thine own consciousness
or in that of another? For he loves another woman, thou desirest to please another
man; and thou art angry if he love another, though he is taught adultery in thee. Thou art
the evil promptress of thine own injury. For even the woman who has been the victim of a
pander shrinks from acting the pander’s part, and though she be vile, it is herself she sins
against and not another. The crime of adultery is almost more tolerable than thine; for
adultery tampers with modesty, but thou with nature.”2006 It is sufficiently clear, I think,
that this eloquence calls passionately upon women to avoid tampering with their appearance
by deceitful arts, and to cultivate modesty and fear. Accordingly, we notice that the style is
neither subdued nor temperate, but majestic throughout. Now in these two authors whom
I have selected as specimens of the rest, and in other ecclesiastical writers who both speak
the truth and speak it well,—speak it, that is, judiciously, pointedly, and with beauty and
power of expression,—many examples may be found of the three styles of speech, scattered
through their various writings and discourses; and the diligent student may by assiduous
reading, intermingled with practice on his own part, become thoroughly imbued with them
all.</p>

<head>Chapter 22.—The Necessity of Variety in Style.</head>
<p>51. But we are not to suppose that it is against rule to mingle these various styles: on
the contrary, every variety of style should be introduced so far as is consistent with good
taste. For when we keep monotonously to one style, we fail to retain the hearer’s attention;
but when we pass from one style to another, the discourse goes off more gracefully, even
though it extend to greater length. Each separate style, again, has varieties of its own which
prevent the hearer’s attention from cooling or becoming languid. We can bear the subdued
style, however, longer without variety than the majestic style. For the mental emotion which
it is necessary to stir up in order to carry the hearer’s feelings with us, when once it has been
sufficiently excited, the higher the pitch to which it is raised, can be maintained the shorter
time. And therefore we must be on our guard, lest, in striving to carry to a higher point the
emotion we have excited, we rather lose what we have already gained. But after the interposition
of matter that we have to treat in a quieter style, we can return with good effect to
that which must be treated forcibly, thus making the tide of eloquence to ebb and flow like
the sea. It follows from this, that the majestic style, if it is to be long continued, ought not
to be unvaried, but should alternate at intervals with the other styles; the speech or writing
as a whole, however, being referred to that style which is the prevailing one.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
<pb n="1356"/>
<head>Chapter 23.—How the Various Styles Should Be Mingled.</head>
<p>52. Now it is a matter of importance to determine what style should be alternated with
what other, and the places where it is necessary that any particular style should be used. In
the majestic style, for instance, it is always, or almost always, desirable that the introduction
should be temperate. And the speaker has it in his discretion to use the subdued style even
where the majestic would be allowable, in order that the majestic when it is used may be the
more majestic by comparison, and may as it were shine out with greater brilliance from the
dark background. Again, whatever may be the style of the speech or writing, when knotty
questions turn up for solution, accuracy of distinction is required, and this naturally demands
the subdued style. And accordingly this style must be used in alternation with the other
two styles whenever questions of that sort turn up; just as we must use the temperate style,
no matter what may be the general tone of the discourse, whenever praise or blame is to be
given without any ulterior reference to the condemnation or acquittal of any one, or to obtaining
the concurrence of any one in a course of action. In the majestic style, then, and in
the quiet likewise, both the other two styles occasionally find place. The temperate style,
on the other hand, not indeed always, but occasionally, needs the quiet style; for example,
when, as I have said, a knotty question comes up to be settled, or when some points that are
susceptible of ornament are left unadorned and expressed in the quiet style, in order to give
greater effect to certain exuberances (as they may be called) of ornament. But the temperate
style never needs the aid of the majestic; for its object is to gratify, never to excite, the mind.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
<pb n="1357"/>
<head>Chapter 24.—The Effects Produced by the Majestic Style.</head>
<p>53. If frequent and vehement applause follows a speaker, we are not to suppose on that
account that he is speaking in the majestic style; for this effect is often produced both by
the accurate distinctions of the quiet style, and by the beauties of the temperate. The
majestic style, on the other hand, frequently silences the audience by its impressiveness, but
calls forth their tears. For example, when at Cæsarea in Mauritania I was dissuading the
people from that civil, or worse than civil, war which they called Caterva (for it was not
fellow-citizens merely, but neighbors, brothers, fathers and sons even, who, divided into
two factions and armed with stones, fought annually at a certain season of the year for several
days continuously, every one killing whomsoever he could), I strove with all the vehemence
of speech that I could command to root out and drive from their hearts and lives an
evil so cruel and inveterate; it was not, however, when I heard their applause, but when I
saw their tears, that I thought I had produced an effect. For the applause showed that they
were instructed and de lighted, but the tears that they were subdued. And when I saw their
tears I was confident even before the event proved it, that this horrible and barbarous custom
(which had been handed down to them from their fathers and their ancestors of generations
long gone by and which like an enemy was besieging their hearts, or rather had complete
possession of them) was overthrown; and immediately that my sermon was finished I called
upon them with heart and voice to give praise and thanks to God. And, lo, with the blessing
of Christ, it is now eight years or more since anything of the sort was attempted there. In
many other cases besides I have observed that men show the effect made on them by the
powerful eloquence of a wise man, not by clamorous applause so much as by groans,
sometimes even by tears, finally by change of life.</p>
<p>54. The quiet style, too, has made a change in many; but it was to teach them what they
were ignorant of, or to persuade them of what they thought incredible, not to make them
do what they knew they ought to do but were unwilling to do. To break down hardness of
this sort, speech needs to be vehement. Praise and censure, too, when they are eloquently
expressed, even in the temperate style, produce such an effect on some, that they are not
only pleased with the eloquence of the encomiums and censures, but are led to live so as
themselves to deserve praise, and to avoid living so as to incur blame. But no one would
say that all who are thus delighted change their habits in consequence, whereas all who are
moved by the majestic style act accordingly, and all who are taught by the quiet style know
or believe a truth which they were previously ignorant of.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
<pb n="1358"/>
<head>Chapter 25.—How the Temperate Style is to Be Used.</head>
<p>55. From all this we may conclude, that the end arrived at by the two styles last mentioned
is the one which it is most essential for those who aspire to speak with wisdom and
eloquence to secure. On the other hand, what the temperate style properly aims at, viz., to
please by beauty of expression, is not in itself an adequate end; but when what we have to
say is good and useful, and when the hearers are both acquainted with it and favorably disposed
towards it, so that it is not necessary either to instruct or persuade them, beauty of
style may have its influence in securing their prompter compliance, or in making them adhere
to it more tenaciously. For as the function of all eloquence, whichever of these three forms
it may assume, is to speak persuasively, and its object is to persuade, an eloquent man will
speak persuasively, whatever style he may adopt; but unless he succeeds in persuading, his
eloquence has not secured its object. Now in the subdued style, he persuades his hearers
that what he says is true; in the majestic style, he persuades them to do what they are aware
they ought to do, but do not; in the temperate style, he persuades them that his speech is
elegant and ornate. But what use is there in attaining such an object as this last? They may
desire it who are vain of their eloquence and make a boast of panegyrics, and such-like
performances, where the object is not to instruct the hearer, or to persuade him to any course
of action, but merely to give him pleasure. We, however, ought to make that end subordinate
to another, viz., the effecting by this style of eloquence what we aim at effecting when we
use the majestic style. For we may by the use of this style persuade men to cultivate good
habits and give up evil ones, if they are not so hardened as to need the vehement style; or if
they have already begun a good course, we may induce them to pursue it more zealously,
and to persevere in it with constancy. Accordingly, even in the temperate style we must use
beauty of expression not for ostentation, but for wise ends; not contenting ourselves merely
with pleasing the hearer, but rather seeking to aid him in the pursuit of the good end which
we hold out before him.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
<pb n="1359"/>
<head>Chapter 26.—In Every Style the Orator Should Aim at Perspicuity, Beauty, and
Persuasiveness.</head>
<p>55. Now in regard to the three conditions I laid down a little while ago2007 as necessary
to be fulfilled by any one who wishes to speak with wisdom and eloquence, viz., perspicuity,
beauty of style, and persuasive power, we are not to understand that these three qualities
attach themselves respectively to the three several styles of speech, one to each, so that perspicuity
is a merit peculiar to the subdued style, beauty to the temperate, and persuasive
power to the majestic. On the contrary, all speech, whatever its style, ought constantly to
aim at, and as far as possible to display, all these three merits. For we do not like even what
we say in the subdued style to pall upon the hearer; and therefore we would be listened to,
not with intelligence merely, but with pleasure as well. Again, why do we enforce what we
teach by divine testimony, except that we wish to carry the hearer with us, that is, to com
pel his assent by calling in the assistance of Him of whom it is said, “Thy testimonies are
very sure”?2008 And when any one narrates a story, even in the subdued style, what does
he wish but to be believed? But who will listen to him if he do not arrest attention by some
beauty of style? And if he be not intelligible, is it not plain that he can neither give pleasure
nor enforce conviction? The subdued style, again, in its own naked simplicity, when it unravels
questions of very great difficulty, and throws an unexpected light upon them; when
it worms out and brings to light some very acute observations from a quarter whence
nothing was expected; when it seizes upon and exposes the falsity of an opposing opinion,
which seemed at its first statement to be unassailable; especially when all this is accompanied
by a natural, unsought grace of expression, and by a rhythm and balance of style which is
not ostentatiously obtruded, but seems rather to be called forth by the nature of the subject:
this style, so used, frequently calls forth applause so great that one can hardly believe it to
be the subdued style. For the fact that it comes forth without either ornament or defense,
and offers battle in its own naked simplicity, does not hinder it from crushing its adversary
by weight of nerve and muscle, and overwhelming and destroying the falsehood that opposes
it by the mere strength of its own right arm. How explain the frequent and vehement applause
that waits upon men who speak thus, except by the pleasure that truth so irresistibly
established, and so victoriously defended, naturally affords? Wherefore the Christian
teacher and speaker ought, when he uses the subdued style, to endeavor not only to be clear
and intelligible, but to give pleasure and to bring home conviction to the hearer.</p>
<p>57. Eloquence of the temperate style, also, must, in the case of the Christian orator, be
neither altogether without ornament, nor unsuitably adorned, nor is it to make the giving
of pleasure its sole aim, which is all it professes to accomplish in the hands of others; but in
<note type="footnote">2007 Chaps. xv. and xvii.</note>
<note type="footnote">2008 Ps. xciii. 5.</note>

<pb n="1360"/>
its encomiums and censures it should aim at inducing the hearer to strive after or avoid or
renounce what it condemns. On the other hand, without perspicuity this style cannot give
pleasure. And so the three qualities, perspicuity, beauty, and persuasiveness, are to be sought
in this style also; beauty, of course, being its primary object.</p>
<p>58. Again, when it becomes necessary to stir and sway the hearer’s mind by the
majestic style (and this is always necessary when he admits that what you say is both true
and agreeable, and yet is unwilling to act accordingly), you must, of course, speak in the
majestic style. But who can be moved if he does not understand what is said? and who will
stay to listen if he receives no pleasure? Wherefore, in this style, too, when an obdurate
heart is to be persuaded to obedience, you must speak so as to be both intelligible and
pleasing, if you would be heard with a submissive mind.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">
<pb n="1361"/>
<head>Chapter 27.—The Man Whose Life is in Harmony with His Teaching Will Teach
with Greater Effect.</head>
<p>59. But whatever may be the majesty of the style, the life of the speaker will count for
more in securing the hearer’s compliance. The man who speaks wisely and eloquently, but
lives wickedly, may, it is true, instruct many who are anxious to learn; though, as it is written,
he “is unprofitable to himself.”2009 Wherefore, also, the apostle says: “Whether in pretence
or in truth Christ is preached.”2010 Now Christ is the truth; yet we see that the truth can be
preached, though not in truth,—that is, what is right and true in itself may be preached by
a man of perverse and deceitful mind. And thus it is that Jesus Christ is preached by those
that seek their own, and not the things that are Jesus Christ’s. But since true believers obey
the voice, not of any man, but of the Lord Himself, who says, “All therefore whatsoever they
bid you observe, that observe and do: but do not ye after their works; for they say and do
not;”2011 therefore it is that men who themselves lead unprofitable lives are heard with profit
by others. For though they seek their own objects, they do not dare to teach their own
doctrines, sitting as they do in the high places of ecclesiastical authority, which is established
on sound doctrine. Wherefore our Lord Himself, before saying what I have just quoted
about men of this stamp, made this observation: “The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’
seat.”2012 The seat they occupied, then, which was not theirs but Moses’, compelled them
to say what was good, though they did what was evil. And so they followed their own course
in their lives, but were prevented by the seat they occupied, which belonged to another,
from preaching their own doctrines.</p>
<p>60. Now these men do good to many by preaching what they themselves do not perform;
but they would do good to very many more if they lived as they preach. For there are
numbers who seek an excuse for their own evil lives in comparing the teaching with the
conduct of their instructors, and who say in their hearts, or even go a little further, and say
with their lips: Why do you not do yourself what you bid me do? And thus they cease to
listen with submission to a man who does not listen to himself, and in despising the
preacher they learn to despise the word that is preached. Wherefore the apostle, writing to
Timothy, after telling him, “Let no man despise thy youth,” adds immediately the course
by which he would avoid contempt: “but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in
conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”2013</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Truth is More Important Than Expression. What is Meant by Strife
About Words.</head>
<p>61. Such a teacher as is here described may, to secure compliance, speak not only quietly
and temperately, but even vehemently, without any breach of modesty, because his life
protects him against contempt. For while he pursues an upright life, he takes care to
maintain a good reputation as well, providing things honest in the sight of God and men,2014
fearing God, and caring for men. In his very speech even he prefers to please by matter
rather than by words; thinks that a thing is well said in proportion as it is true in fact, and
that a teacher should govern his words, not let the words govern him. This is what the
apostle says: “Not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none
effect.”2015 To the same effect also is what he says to Timothy: “Charging them before the
Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.”2016
Now this does not mean that, when adversaries oppose the truth, we are to say nothing in
defence of the truth. For where, then, would be what he says when he is describing the sort
of man a bishop ought to be: “that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and
convince the gainsayers?”2017 To strive about words is not to be careful about the way to
overcome error by truth, but to be anxious that your mode of expression should be preferred
to that of another. The man who does not strive about words, whether he speak quietly,
temperately, or vehemently, uses words with no other purpose than to make the truth plain,
pleasing, and effective; for not even love itself, which is the end of the commandment and
the fulfilling of the law,2018 can be rightly exercised unless the objects of love are true and
not false. For as a man with a comely body but an ill-conditioned mind is a more painful
object than if his body too were deformed, so men who teach lies are the more pitiable if
they happen to be eloquent in speech. To speak eloquently, then, and wisely as well, is just
to express truths which it is expedient to teach in fit and proper words,—words which in
the subdued style are adequate, in the temperate, elegant, and in the majestic, forcible. But
the man who cannot speak both eloquently and wisely should speak wisely without eloquence,
rather than eloquently without wisdom.</p>

others, and commit it to memory, and deliver it to the people, they cannot be blamed, supposing
them to do it without deception. For in this way many become preachers of the
truth (which is certainly desirable), and yet not many teachers; for all deliver the discourse
which one real teacher has composed, and there are no divisions among them. Nor are such
men to be alarmed by the words of Jeremiah the prophet, through whom God denounces
those who steal His words every one from his neighbor.2019 For those who steal take what
does not belong to them, but the word of God belongs to all who obey it; and it is the man
who speaks well, but lives badly, who really takes the words that belong to another. For the
good things he says seem to be the result of his own thought, and yet they have nothing in
common with his manner of life. And so God has said that they steal His words who would
appear good by speaking God’s words, but are in fact bad, as they follow their own ways.
And if you look closely into the matter, it is not really themselves who say the good things
they say. For how can they say in words what they deny in deeds? It is not for nothing that
the apostle says of such men: “They profess that they know God, but in works they deny
Him.”2020 In one sense, then, they do say the things, and in another sense they do not say
them; for both these statements must be true, both being made by Him who is the Truth.
Speaking of such men, in one place He says, “Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
and do; but do not ye after their works;”—that is to say, what ye hear from their lips, that
do; what ye see in their lives, that do ye not;—“for they say and do not.”2021 And so, though
they do not, yet they say. But in another place, upbraiding such men, He says, “O generation
of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?”2022 And from this it would appear
that even what they say, when they say what is good, it is not themselves who say, for in will
and in deed they deny what they say. Hence it happens that a wicked man who is eloquent
may compose a discourse in which the truth is set forth to be delivered by a good man who
is not eloquent; and when this takes place, the former draws from himself what does not
belong to him, and the latter receives from another what really belongs to himself. But when

true believers render this service to true believers, both parties speak what is their own, for
God is theirs, to whom belongs all that they say; and even those who could not compose
what they say make it their own by composing their lives in harmony with it.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—The Preacher Should Commence His Discourse with Prayer to God.</head>
<p>63. But whether a man is going to address the people or to dictate what others will deliver
or read to the people, he ought to pray God to put into his mouth a suitable discourse.
For if Queen Esther prayed, when she was about to speak to the king touching the temporal
welfare of her race, that God would put fit words into her mouth,2023 how much more ought
he to pray for the same blessing who labors in word and doctrine for the eternal welfare of
men? Those, again, who are to deliver what others compose for them ought, before they
receive their discourse, to pray for those who are preparing it; and when they have received
it, they ought to pray both that they themselves may deliver it well, and that those to whom
they address it may give ear; and when the discourse has a happy issue, they ought to render
thanks to Him from whom they know such blessings come, so that all the praise may be His
“in whose hand are both we and our words.”2024</p>

<head>Chapter 31.—Apology for the Length of the Work.</head>
<p>64. This book has extended to a greater length than I expected or desired. But the
reader or hearer who finds pleasure in it will not think it long. He who thinks it long, but
is anxious to know its contents, may read it in part. He who does not care to be acquainted
with it need not complain of its length. I, however, give thanks to God that with what little
ability I possess I have in these four books striven to depict, not the sort of man I am myself
(for my defects are very many), but the sort of man he ought to be who desires to labor in
sound, that is, in Christian doctrine, not for his own instruction only, but for that of others
also.</p>

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:</head>
<head>Summa Theologica by St. Thomas Aquinas</head>
<p>Written from 1265-1274, the Summa Theologica is St. Thomas Aquinas' greatest work.
Originally written for the "instruction of beginners," time has shown that all believers can
come to learn from this enriching book. Organized systemically for the clearest way of
"setting forth" the "sacred doctrine," Aquinas addresses many of Christianity's most pertinent
questions in this multi-volume work. The First Part of the Summa begins with the existence
and nature of God, before moving to creation and the nature of man. The Second Part
contains his examination of morality and law; it also provides his account of the theological
virtues, the cardinal virtues, and the seven deadly sins. The Third Part, uncompleted due
to Aquinas' death, treats the incarnation and the sacraments. Taken together, the three parts
compose one of the most impressive works of Christianity. Indeed, countless people from
many centuries have studied and learned from the Summa; it has been widely influential
from Aquinas' own day to the present. Hence, those with a passing inquiry or a serious
question, an existential concern or a philosophical problem, can learn much from reading
and studying St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica.</p>

<head>Confessions of Saint Augustine by St. Augustine</head>
<p>In his Confessions, Saint Augustine reflects upon his life in the light of scripture and the
presence of God. He begins with his infancy, pondering the many sins of his life before his
conversion, and he confesses not only his sins but even more the greatness of God. This
work presents a wonderful contrast between the Holy God who created all things and whom
heaven and earth cannot contain, and a commonly sinful man who has joyfully received
God's loving salvation and mercy.
Many scholars consider Saint Augustine to be among the greatest and most influential
fathers of the early church. And as you read his Confessions, you will find the confident
humility that is common among those whom Jesus calls "great in the kingdom of heaven."
Augustine writes as a common man, and so his words span time and tradition. May his
Confessions guide you to the One whom he confesses.</p>

<head>NPNF2-14. The Seven Ecumenical Councils</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series, each with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses
on a variety of important Church Fathers, ranging from
the fourth century to the eighth century.This volume contains
the writings of the Seven Ecumenical Councils. Spanning
four centuries, they are: the First Council of Nicaea, the First
Council of Constantinople, the Council of Ephesus, the
Council of Chalcedon, the Second Council of Constantinople,
the Third Council of Constantinople, and the Second Council
of Nicaea.The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers are comprehensive
in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive
and illuminating texts from some of the great theologians of
the Christian church.These spiritually enlightening texts have
aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive
and fruitful even today!

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>The work intrusted to me of preparing this volume evidently can be divided into two
separate parts. The first, the collecting of the material needed and the setting of it before
the reader in the English tongue; the other, the preparation of suitable introductions and
notes to the matter thus provided. Now in each of these departments two courses were
open to the editor: the one, to be original; the other, to be a copyist. I need hardly say that
of these the former offered many temptations. But I could not fail to recognize the fact that
such a course would greatly take from the real value of the work, and therefore without any
hesitation I have adopted the other alternative, and have endeavoured, so far as was at all
possible, to keep myself out of the question altogether; and as a general rule even the translation
of the text (as distinguished from the notes) is not mine but that of some scholar of
well-established reputation.</p>
<p>In the carrying out of this method of procedure I have availed myself of all the translations
which I could find, and where, after comparing them with the original, I have thought
them substantially accurate, I have adopted them and reproduced them. Where I have
thought that the translation was misleading, I have amended it from some other translation,
and, I think, in no case have I ventured a change of translation which rests upon my own
judgment alone. A very considerable portion, however, of the matter found in this volume
is now translated into English for the first time. For some of this I am indebted to my friends,
who have most kindly given me every assistance in their power, but even here no translation
has been made from the Greek without careful reference being had to the traditional understanding,
as handed down in the Latin versions, and wherever the Latin and Greek texts
differ on material points the difference has been noted. I have not thought it necessary nor
desirable to specify the source of each particular translation, but I have provided for the use
of the reader a list of all the translations which I have used. I should also add that I have
not considered any one text sufficiently well established as to command any deference being
paid to it, and that I have usually followed (for my own convenience rather than for any
other reason) the text contained in Labbe and Cossart’s Concilia. No doubt Hardouin and
Mansi are in some respects superior, but old prejudices are very strong, and the reader will
remember that these differing Concilia gave rise to a hard-fought battle in the history of the
Gallican Church. I should add, however, that where more recent students of the subject
have detected errors of importance in Labbe’s text, I have corrected them, usually noting
the variety of reading. With regard then to the text I entirely disclaim any responsibility,
and the more so as on such a matter my opinion would be entirely valueless. And with regard
to the translation my responsibility goes no further than the certifying the reader that, to
all intents and purposes, the meaning of the original is presented to him in the English lan-

<pb n="4"/>
guage and without interpretation being introduced under the specious guise of translation.
Some portions are mere literal translations, and some are done into more idiomatic English,
but all—so far as I am able to judge—are fair renderings of the original, its ambiguities being
duly preserved. I have used as the foundation of the translation of the canons of the first
four synods and of the five Provincial Synods that most convenient book, Index Canonum,
by the Rev. John Fulton, D.D., D.C.L., in which united to a good translation is a Greek text,
very well edited and clearly printed.</p>
<p>In preparing the other division of the book, that is to say, the Introduction and Notes,
I have been guided by the same considerations. Here will be found no new and brilliant
guesses of my own, but a collection of the most reliable conclusions of the most weighty
critics and commentators. Where the notes are of any length I have traced the source and
given the exact reference, but for the brief notes, where I have not thought this necessary,
the reader may feel the greatest confidence that he is not reading any surmises of mine, but
that in every particular what he reads rests upon the authority of the greatest names who
have written on the subject. In the bibliographical table already referred to I have placed
the authorities most frequently cited.</p>
<p>I think it necessary to make a few remarks upon the rule which I have laid down for
myself with regard to my attitude on controverted questions bearing upon doctrine or ecclesiastical
discipline. It seems to me that in such a work as the present any expression of
the editor’s views would be eminently out of place. I have therefore confined myself to a
bare statement of what I conceive to be the facts of the case, and have left the reader to draw
from them what conclusions he pleases. I hope that this volume may be equally acceptable
to the Catholic and to the Protestant, to the Eastern and to the Western, and while I naturally
think that the facts presented are clearly in accordance with my own views, I hope that those
who draw from the same premises different conclusions will find these premises stated to
their satisfaction in the following pages. And should such be the case this volume may well
be a step toward “the union of all” and toward “the peace of all the holy churches of God,”
for which the unchanging East has so constantly prayed in her liturgy.</p>
<p>I wish to explain to the reader one other principle on which I have proceeded in preparing
this volume. It professes to be a translation of the decrees and canons of certain ecclesiastical
synods. It is not a history of those synods, nor is it a theological treatise upon the truth
or otherwise of the doctrines set forth by those synods in their legislation. I have therefore
carefully restricted my own historical introductions to a bare statement of such facts as
seemed needed to render the meaning of the matter subsequently presented intelligible to
the reader. And with regard to doctrine I have pursued the same course, merely explaining
what the doctrine taught or condemned was, without entering into any consideration of its
truth or falsity. For the history of the Church and its Councils the reader must consult the
great historians; for a defence of the Church’s faith he must read the works of her theologians.</p>

<pb n="5"/>
<p>I need hardly say that the overwhelming majority of the references found in this volume
I have had no opportunity of verifying, no copy of many of the books being (so far as I
know) to be found in America. I have, however, taken great pains to insure accuracy in reproducing
the references as given in the books from which I have cited them; this, however,
does not give me any feeling of confidence that they may be relied on, especially as in some
cases where I have been able to look them up, I have found errors of the most serious kind.</p>
<p>It now only remains that I thank all those who have assisted me in this work, and especially
I must mention his Excellency the High Procurator of the Holy Governing Synod of
Russia, who directed the bibliographical table of Russian editions of the Canons, etc., which
is found in this volume, to be prepared for me by Professor Glubokoffski of the Ecclesiastical
Academy at St. Petersburgh. My special thanks are due to the learned professor just named
for the very admirable manner in which he has performed the work, and to Mr. W. J. Birkbeck,
who has added one more to his numerous labours for making the West better acquainted
with the East by translating the Russian ms. into English. I cannot but pause here to
remark how deep my regret is that my ignorance of the Russian and Slavic tongues has
prevented me from laying before my readers the treasures of learning and the stores of tradition
and local illustration which these volumes must contain. I am, however, extremely
well pleased in being able to put those, who are more fortunate than myself in this respect,
in the way of investigating the matter for themselves, by supplying them with the titles of
the books on the subject. I desire also to offer my thanks to Professor Bolotoff for the
valuable information he sent me as well as for a copy of his learned (and often most just)
strictures upon Professor Lauchert’s book, “Die Kanones der wichtigsten altkirchlichen
Concilien nebst den Apostolischen Kanones.” (Freiburg in B. und Leipzig, 1896.)</p>
<p>The Rev. Wm. McGarvey has helped me most kindly by translating parts of the Second
Council of Nice, and one or more of the African Canons; and by looking over the translation
of the entire African Code.</p>
<p>The Rev. F. A. Sanborn translated two of St. Cyril’s letters, and the Rev. Leighton Hoskins
the Sardican Canons. To these and many other of my friends, who in one way or another
helped me, I wish to return my deep thanks; also to the Nashotah Theological Seminary
and to the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Mt. Airy, Philadelphia, for having placed their
libraries entirely at my disposal; nor can I end this list without mention of my sister, who
has assisted me most materially through the entire progress of the work, and without whom
I never could have undertaken it.</p>
<p>When I think of the great number of authors cited, of the rapidity with which most of
the translation has had to be done, of the difficulty of getting access to the necessary books,
and of the vast range of subjects touched upon (including almost every branch of ecclesiastical
and theological learning), I feel I must throw myself and my work upon the reader’s
indulgence and beg him to take all this in consideration in making his estimate of the value

<pb n="6"/>
of the work done. As for me, now that it is all finished, I feel like crying out with the reader,
in deep shame at the recollection of the many blunders he has made in reading the lesson,—“
Tu autem, Domine, miserere nobis!”</p>
<p>In conclusion I would add that nothing I have written must be interpreted as meaning
that the editor personally has any doubt of the truth of the doctrines set forth by the Ecumenical
Councils of the Christian Church, and I wish to declare in the most distinct manner
that I accept all the doctrinal decrees of the Seven Ecumenical Synods as infallible and irreformable.

<head>General Introduction.</head>

<head>I. Method of Treatment.</head>
<p>It is absolutely necessary that a few words should be said on the general arrangement
of the work. The reader will find given him in the English tongue, so far as they have come
down to us, all the doctrinal definitions of the Seven Ecumenical Councils (councils which
have always, and still do, receive the unqualified acceptance of both East and West), and all
the canons, disciplinary and doctrinal, which were enacted by them. To these has been added
a translation in full of all the canons of the local synods which received the approval and
sanction of the aforesaid Ecumenical Councils. Besides this, as throwing light upon the
subject, large extracts from the Acta have been given, in fact all that seemed to illustrate the
decrees; and, that nothing might be lacking, in an appendix has been placed a collection of
all the non-synodal canons which have received the sanction of the Ecumenical Synods, the
“Canons of the Apostles” (so called) being given in full, and the others in a shortened form,
for the most part in the words of the admirable and learned John Johnson.</p>
<p>This then is the text of the volume; but it is manifest that it stood in need of much
comment to make its meaning clear to the reader, even if well informed on ordinary matters.
To provide for this, to each synodal canon there has been added the Ancient Epitome.</p>
<p>Of this Epitome Bishop Beveridge treats with great learning in section xxvi. of his
“Prolegomena” to his Synodicon, and shows that while some attributed this epitome to the
Greek mediæval scholiast Aristenus, it cannot be his, as he has taken it for the text of his
commentaries, and has in more than one instance pointed out that whoever he was who
made it had, in his judgment, missed the sense.1</p>
<p>The Epitome must indeed be much older, for Nicholas Hydruntinus, who lived in the
times of Alexis Angelus, when intending to quote one of the canons of Ephesus, actually
quotes words which are not in that canon, but which are in the Epitome. “Wherefore,” says
Beveridge, “it is manifest that the Epitome is here cited, and that under the name of the
whole canon.” This being established we may justly look upon the Ancient Epitome as
supplying us with a very ancient gloss upon the canons.</p>
<p>To this Epitome have been added Notes, taken from most of the great commentators,
and Excursuses, largely made up from the writings of the greatest theologians, canonists,
archæologists, etc., with regard to whom and their writings, all the information that seems
necessary the reader will find in the Bibliographical Introduction.</p>

<head>II. Concerning Ecumenical Councils in General.</head>
<p>An Ecumenical Synod may be defined as a synod the decrees of which have found acceptance
by the Church in the whole world.2 It is not necessary to make a council ecumenical
that the number of bishops present should be large, there were but 325 at Nice, and 150
at I. Constantinople; it is not necessary that it should be assembled with the intention of its
being ecumenical, such was not the case with I. Constantinople; it is not necessary that all
parts of the world should have been represented or even that the bishops of such parts should
have been invited. All that is necessary is that its decrees find ecumenical acceptance afterwards,
and its ecumenical character be universally recognized.</p>
<p>The reader will notice that in the foregoing I have not proceeded from the theological
foundation of what an Ecumenical Synod should be (with this question the present volume
has nothing to do), but from a consideration of the historical question as to what the Seven
Councils have in common, which distinguishes them from the other councils of the Christian
Church.</p>
<p>And here it is well to note that there have been many “General Councils” which have
not been “Ecumenical.” It is true that in ordinary parlance we often use the expressions as
interchangeable, but such really is not the case. There are but seven universally recognized
and undisputed “Ecumenical Councils”; on the other hand, the number of “General Councils”
is very considerable, and as a matter of fact of these last several very large ones fell into
heresy. It is only necessary to mention as examples the Latrocinium and the spurious
“Seventh Council,” held by the iconoclastic heretics. It is therefore the mere statement of
an historical fact to say that General Councils have erred.</p>
<p>The Ecumenical Councils claimed for themselves an immunity from error in their
doctrinal and moral teaching, resting such claim upon the promise of the presence and
<note type="footnote">2 This was until the division of the East and West the definition accepted by all the whole Christian world.
But since the Church has been divided, while the East has kept to the old definition and has not pretended to
have held any Ecumenical Councils, the Roman Church has made a new definition of the old term and has then
proceeded to hold a very considerable number of synods which she recognizes as Ecumenical. I say “a very
considerable number,” for even among Roman Catholic theologians there is much dispute as to the number of
these “Ecumenical Synods,” the decrees of which, like those of Trent and the Vatican, have never been received
by about half of the Christian world, including four of the five patriarchates and of the fifth patriarchate all the
Anglican communion. According to modern Roman writers the definition of these non-ecumenically received
Ecumenical Synods is “Ecumenical councils are those to which the bishops and others entitled to vote are convoked
from the whole world under the Presidency of the Pope or his legates, and the decrees of which, having
received Papal confirmation, bind all Christians.” Addis and Arnold, A Catholic Dictionary, s. v. Councils. The
reader will notice that by this definition one at least (I. Constantinople), probably three, of the seven undisputed
Ecumenical Synods cease to be such.</note>

<pb n="9"/>
guidance of the Holy Ghost. The Council looked upon itself, not as revealing any new truth,
but as setting forth the faith once for all delivered to the Saints, its decisions therefore were
in themselves ecumenical, as being an expression of the mind of the whole body of the
faithful both clerical and lay, the sensus communis of the Church. And by the then teaching
of the Church that ecumenical consensus was considered free from the suspicion of error,
guarded, (as was believed,) by the Lord’s promise that the gates of hell should not prevail
against his Church. This then is what Catholics mean when they affirm the infallibility of
Ecumenical Councils. Whether this opinion is true or false is a question outside the scope
of the present discussion. It was necessary, however, to state that these Councils looked
upon themselves as divinely protected in their decisions from error in faith and morals, lest
the reader should otherwise be at a loss to understand the anathematisms which follow the
decrees, and which indeed would be singularly out of place, if the decrees which they thus
emphatically affirm were supposed to rest only upon human wisdom and speculation, instead
of upon divine authority.</p>
<p>Theologians consider that the decisions of Ecumenical Councils, like all juridical decrees,
must be construed strictly, and that only the point at issue must be looked upon as decided.
The obiter dicta of so august a body are no doubt of the greatest weight, but yet they have
no claim to be possessed of that supreme authority which belongs to the definition of the
particular point under consideration.3</p>
<p>The Seven Ecumenical Councils were all called together at the commandment and will
of Princes; without any knowledge of the matter on the part of the Pope in one case at least
(1st Constantinople)4; without any consultation with him in the case of I. Nice, so far as we
know5; and contrary to his expressed desire in at least the case of Chalcedon, when he only
gave a reluctant consent after the Emperor Marcian had already convoked the synod. From
this it is historically evident that Ecumenical Councils can be summoned without either the
knowledge or consent of the See of Rome.</p>
<p>In the history of the Christian Church, especially at a later period in connection with
the Great Schism, much discussion has taken place among the learned as to the relative
powers of a General Council and of the Pope. It will be remembered by everyone that the
<note type="footnote">3 Vide Vasquez, P. III., Disp. 181, c. 9; Bellarmin., De Concil., Lib. II., cap. xvij.; Veron, Rule of the Cath. Faith,

<pb n="10"/>
superior authority of the council was not only taught, but on one occasion acted on, by a
council, but this is outside of the period covered by the Seven Ecumenical Synods, and I
shall therefore only discuss the relations of these seven synods to the Roman See. And in
the first place it is evident that no council has ever been received as ecumenical which has
not been received and confirmed by the Roman Pontiff. But, after all, this is only saying
that no council has been accepted as ecumenical which has not been ecumenically received,
for it must be remembered that there was but one Patriarchate for the whole West, that of
Rome; and this is true to all intents and purposes, whether or no certain sections had extrapatriarchal
privileges, and were “auto-cephalous.”</p>
<p>But it would be giving an entirely unfair impression of the matter to the reader were he
left to suppose that this necessity for Rome’s confirmation sprang necessarily from any idea
of Rome’s infallibility. So far as appears from any extant document, such an idea was as
unknown in the whole world then as it is in four of the five patriarchates to-day. And it
should be borne in mind that the confirmation by the Emperor was sought for and spoken
of in quite as strong, if not stronger, terms. Before passing to a particular examination of
what relation each of the Councils bore to the Roman See, it may be well to note that while
as an historical fact each of the Seven Ecumenical Councils did eventually find acceptance
at Rome, this fact does not prove that such acceptance is necessary in the nature of things.
If we can imagine a time when Rome is not in communion with the greater part of the West,
then it is quite possible to imagine that an Ecumenical Council could be held whose decrees
would (for the time being) be rejected by the unworthy occupant of the Apostolic See. I am
not asserting that such a state of affairs is possible from a theological standpoint, but merely
stating an historical contingency which is perfectly within the range of imagination, even
if cut off from any practical possibility by the faith of some.</p>
<p>We now come to a consideration of how, by its acts, each of the Seven Synods intimated
its relation to the Roman See:</p>
<p>1. The First Council of Nice passed a canon in which some at least of the Roman rights
are evidently looked upon as being exactly on the same plane as those of other metropolitans,
declaring that they rest upon “custom.”</p>
<p>It was the Emperor who originated this council and called it together, if we may believe
his own words and those of the council; and while indeed it is possible that when the Emperor
did not preside in person, Hosius of Cordova may have done so (even uniting the two
Roman Presbyters who were the legates of the Roman See with him), yet there is no evidence
that anything of the kind ever took place, and a pope, Felix III. (a.d. 483–492), in his Fifth
Epistle (ad Imp. Zen.) declares that Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, presided at this council.6
<note type="footnote">6 Cf. Theod. H. E., Lib. I., e. 6.</note>

<pb n="11"/>
The matter, however, is of little moment as no one would deny the right of the See of
Rome to preside in a council of the whole Church.</p>
<p>2. The Second Ecumenical Council was called together by the Emperor without the
knowledge of the Roman Pontiff. Nor was he invited to be present. Its first president was
not in communion at the time of its session with the Roman Church. And, without any
recourse to the first of all the patriarchs, it passed a canon changing the order of the patriarchates,
and setting the new see of Constantinople in a higher place than the other ancient
patriarchates, in fact immediately after Rome. Of course Protestants will consider this a
matter of very minor importance, looking upon all patriarchal divisions and rank and priority
(the Papacy included) as of a disciplinary character and as being jure ecclesiastico, and
in no way affecting doctrine, but any fair reading of the third canon of this synod would
seem plainly to assert that as the first rank of Rome rested upon the fact of its being the
capital city, so the new capital city should have the second rank. If this interpretation is
correct it affects very materially the Roman claim of jure divino primacy.</p>
<p>3. Before the third of the Ecumenical Synods was called to meet, Pope Celestine had
already convicted Nestorius of heresy and deposed and excommunicated him. When subsequently
the synod was assembled, and before the papal legates had arrived, the Council
met, treated Nestorius as in good standing, entirely ignoring the sentence already given by
Rome, and having examined the case (after summoning him three times to appear that he
might be heard in his own defence), proceeded to sentence Nestorius, and immediately
published the sentence. On the 10th of July (more than a fortnight later), the papal legates
having arrived, a second session was held, at which they were told what had been done, all
of which they were good enough to approve of.7</p>
<note type="footnote">7 Protestant Controversialists, as well as others, have curious ways of stating historical events without any
regard to the facts of the case. A notable instance of this is found in Dr. Salmon’s Infallibility of the Church (p.
426 of the 2d Edition) where we are told that “the only one of the great controversies in which the Pope really
did his part in teaching Christians what to believe was the Eutychian controversy. Leo the Great, instead of
waiting, as Popes usually do, till the question was settled, published his sentiments at the beginning, and his
letter to Flavian was adopted by the Council of Chalcedon. This is what would have always happened if God
had really made the Pope the guide to the Church. But this case is quite exceptional, resulting from the accident
that Leo was a good theologian, besides being a man of great vigour of character. No similar influence was exercised
either by his predecessors or successors.” This sentence is not pleasant reading, for it is an awe-inspiring
display of one of two things, neither of which should be in the author of such a book. We need only remind the
reader that Celestine had condemned Nestorius and his teaching before the Council of Ephesus; that Honorius
had written letters defining the question with regard to the will or wills of the Incarnate Son before the III.
Council of Constantinople (which excommunicated him as a heretic for these very letters); that Pope Vigilius
condemned the “Three Chapters” before the II. Council of Constantinople; and that Gregory II. condemned
the iconoclastic heresy before the Seventh Synod, if the letters attributed to him be genuine (which is not quite</note>

<pb n="12"/>
<p>4. The Council of Chalcedon refused to consider the Eutychian matter as settled by
Rome’s decision or to accept Leo’s Tome without examination as to whether it was orthodox.
Moreover it passed a canon at a session which the Papal legates refused to attend, ratifying
the order of the Patriarchates fixed at I. Constantinople, and declaring that “the Fathers had
very properly given privileges to Old Rome as the imperial city, and that now they gave the
same (τὰ ἴσα πρεσβεῖα) privileges” to Constantinople as the seat of the imperial government
at that time.</p>
<p>5. The fifth of the Ecumenical Synods refused to receive any written doctrinal communication
from the then pope (Vigilius), took his name from the diptychs, and refused him
communion.</p>
<p>6. The Third Council of Constantinople, the sixth of the Ecumenical Synods, excommunicated
Pope Honorius, who had been dead for years, for holding and teaching the
Monothelite heresy.</p>
<p>7. It is certain that the Pope had nothing to do with the calling of the Seventh Synod,8
and quite possible that it was presided over by Tarasius and not by the Papal legates.</p>
<p>Such is, in brief, the evidence which the Ecumenical Councils give on the subject of
what, for lack of a better designation, may be called the Papal claims. Under these circumstances
it may not be deemed strange that some extreme ultramontanists have arrived at
the conclusion that much of the acts and decisions as we have them is spurious, or at least
corrupted in an anti-papal direction. Vincenzi, who is the most learned of these writers,
argues somewhat thus “if the members of the Ecumenical Synods believed as we do to-day
with regard to the Papacy it is impossible that they should have acted and spoken as they
did, but we know they must have believed as we do, ergo they did not so act or speak.” The
logic is admirable, but the truth of the conclusion depends upon the truth of the minor
premise. The forgeries would have been very extensive, and who were they done by? Forgeries,
as the false decretals, to advance papal claims we are unfortunately familiar with, but
it is hard to imagine who could have forged in Greek and Latin the acts of the Ecumenical
Synods. It is not necessary to pursue the matter any further, perhaps its very mention was
uncalled for, but I wish to be absolutely fair, that no one may say that any evidence has been
suppressed.9</p>

by the See of Rome before the meeting of a General Council were Arianism and Macedonianism, and some have
held (though mistakenly as is generally thought) that Arius was condemned by a synod held at Rome before
that of Nice.</note>

<head>III. The Number of the Ecumenical Synods.</head>
<p>It may not be unjustly expected that some reasons should be assigned for limiting the
number of the Ecumenical Synods to seven. There is no need here to enter into any proof
that Nice, I. Constantinople, Ephesus and Chalcedon are Ecumenical, since so long ago as
the time of St. Gregory the Great, that Saint and Doctor said of them: “I venerate the first
four Ecumenical Councils equally with the Four Gospels (sicut quatuor Evangelia),”10 and
no one has been found to question that in so saying he gave expression to the mind of the
Church of his day. Of the fifth and sixth synods there never was any real doubt, although
there was trouble at first about the reception of the fifth in some places. The ecumenical
character of the seventh is not disputed by East or West and has not been for near a thousand
years, and full proof of its ecumenicity will be found in connection with that council. There
is therefore no possible doubt that these seven must be included, but it may be asked why
certain others are not here also.</p>
<p>The following is a list of those that might seem to have a claim: Sardica (343 circa),
Quinisext (692), Constantinople (869), Lyons (1274), and Florence (1439).</p>
<p>The reasons for rejecting the claims of Sardica will be found in connection with the
canons set forth by that council. The same is the case with regard to the claims of the Synod
in Trullo. It is true that IV. Constantinople, holden in a.d. 869, was for a short while held
as Ecumenical by both East and West, and continues to be held as such by the Latin Church
down to this day, but it was soon rejected by the East and another synod of Constantinople
(879), which undid much of its work, has for the Greeks taken its place. However the
Easterns do not claim for this synod an ecumenical character, but confine the number to
seven.</p>
<p>The Councils of Lyons and Florence both fail of ecumenicity for the same reason. At
both the East was represented, and at each an agreement was arrived at, but neither agreement
was subsequently accepted in the East, and the decrees therefore have failed, as yet, of receiving
ecumenical acceptance.</p>
<p>We are left therefore with Seven Ecumenical Councils, neither more nor less, and these
are fully treated of in the pages that follow.</p>

<head>Bibliographical Introduction.</head>
<p>To the student of the ancient synods of the Church of Christ, the name of William
Beveridge must ever stand most illustrious; and his work on the canons of the undivided
Church as received by the Greeks, published at Oxford in 1672, will remain a lasting glory
to the Anglican Church, as the “Concilia” of Labbe and Cossart, which appeared in Paris
about the same time, must ever redound to the glory of her sister, the Gallican Church.</p>
<p>Of the permanent value of Beveridge’s work there can be no greater evidence than that
to-day it is quoted all the world over, and not only are Anglicans proud of the bishop of St.
Asaph, but Catholics and Protestants, Westerns and Easterns alike quote him as an authority.
In illustration of this it will be sufficient to mention two examples, the most extensive and
learned work on the councils of our own day, that by the Roman Catholic bishop Hefele,
and the “Compendium of Canon Law,” by the Metropolitan of the Orthodox Greek Hungarian
Church,11 in both of which the reader will find constant reference to Beveridge’s
“Synodicon.”</p>
<p>This great work appeared in two volumes full folio, with the Greek text, beautifully
printed, but of course with the ligatures so perplexing to the ordinary Greek reader of today.
It should however be noted that the most learned and interesting Prolegomena in
Συνοδικὸν sive Pandectæ Canonum, as well as the Præfationem ad annotationes in Canones
Apostolicos, is reprinted as an Appendix to Vol. XII. of “The Theological Works of William
Beveridge, sometime lord bishop of St. Asaph,” in the “Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology,”
(published at Oxford, 1848), which also contains a reprint of the “Codex Canonum Ecclesiæ
Primitivæ vindicatus ac illustratus,” of which last work I shall have something to say in
connection with the Apostolical Canons in the Appendix to this volume.</p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the value of the Prolegomena and it is greatly to be wished that
this most unique preface were more read by students. It contains a fund of out-of-the-way
information which can be found nowhere else collected together, and while indeed later
research has thrown some further light upon the subject, yet the main conclusions of Bishop
Beveridge are still accepted by the learned with but few exceptions. I have endeavoured, as
far as possible to incorporate into this volume the most important part of the learned bishop’s
notes and observations, but the real student must consult the work itself. The reader will
be interested to know that the greatest English scholars of his day assisted Bishop Beveridge
in his work, among whom was John Pearson, the defender of the Ignatian Epistles.</p>

<p>I think I cannot do better than set out in full the contents of the Synodicon so that the
student may know just what he will find in its pages:</p>

<pb n="17"/>
<p>An Index Rerum et Verborum of the Notes.</p>
<p>Such are the contents of Bishop Beveridge’s great work, and it is impossible to exaggerate
its value. But it will be noticed that it only covers the disciplinary action of the Councils,
and does not give the dogmatic decrees, these being excluded from the author’s plan.</p>
<p>Before leaving the collections of the canons we must mention the great work of Justellus
(the Preface and notes of which are found reprinted in Migne’s Pat. Lat., Tom. LXVII.);
Canonum Ecclesiæ Universæ Gr. et Lat. cum Præfatione Notisque Christoph. Justelli.</p>
<p>The author was counsellor and secretary to the King of France, was born in Paris 1580,
and died in 1649. After his death there appeared at Paris in 1661 a work in 2 volumes folio,
with the following title: Bibliotheca juris canonici vetus…ex antiquis codicibus mss. Bibliothecæ
Christopheri Justelli.…Opera et studio Gul. Voelli et Henrici Justelli.</p>
<p>The Church in Paris had the honour of having among its Cathedral clergy the first
scholar who published a collection of the Acts of the councils. James Merlin was Canon
and Grand Penitentiary of the Metropolitan Church, and the first edition of his work he
put out in 1523 in one volume folio. This work passed through several editions within a
few years, but soon gave place to fuller collections.14</p>
<p>In 1538, the Belgian Franciscan Peter Crabbe (Pierre Grable) issued at Cologne an enlarged
collection in two volumes, and the second edition in 1551 was enlarged to three folio
volumes. Besides these, there was Lawrence Surius’s still more complete collection, published
in 1557 (4 vols. folio), and the Venice collection compiled by Domenick Bollanus, O. P.,
and printed by Dominic Nicolini, 1585 (5 vols. folio).</p>
<p>But the renowned collection of Professor Severin Binius surpassed all its predecessors,
and its historical and critical notes are quoted with respect even to-day. The first edition,
in four volumes folio, was issued at Cologne in 1606, and later editions, better than the first,
in 1618 and 1636. This last edition was published at Paris in nine volumes, and made use
of the Roman collection.</p>
<p>To the learned Jesuit Sirmond belongs the chief glory of having compiled this Roman
collection, and the “Introduction” is from his pen. The work was undertaken by the authority
of Pope Paul V., and much of the Greek text, copied from mss. in the Vatican Library, was
now for the first time given to the reading public. This collection contains only the Ecumenical
Councils according to the Roman method of reckoning, and its compilation took from
1608 to 1612.</p>
<note type="footnote">14 I am indebted to Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. I., p. 67 et seqq., for this account of Merlin’s Collection,
as also for most of the statements that follow. Hefele says (footnote to page 67): “The longest details on Merlin’s
edition are found in a work of Salmon, Doctor and Librarian of the Sorbonne, Traité de l’Etude des Conciles et
de leurs Collections, etc. Paris, 1726.”</note>

<pb n="18"/>
<p>No collection appeared from this date until the “Collectio Regia,” a magnificent series
of thirty-seven volumes folio, at the royal press at Paris in 1644. But while it was superb in
get up, it left much to be desired when looked at critically, for many faults of the Roman
edition already pointed out by Sirmond were not corrected.</p>
<p>And now we have reached the time when the first really great Concilia appeared, which
while only filling seventeen volumes in folio was yet far more complete —Hefele says twentyfive
per cent. more complete—than the great Collectio Regia just described. This edition
was the work of Philip Labbe (Labbeus in Latin), S. J., and was completed after his death in
1667, by Father Gabriel Cossart of the same Society—“Almost all the French savants quote
from this edition of Labbe’s with Baluze’s supplement,”15 and I have followed their lead,
availing myself of the corrections made by later editors. The title of the edition used in this
work is: “Sacrasancta Concilia ad Regiam Editionem exacta. Studio Philip. Labbei et Gabr.
Cossartii, Soc. Jesu Presbyterorum. Lutetiæ Parisiorum. MDCLXXI. Cum Privilegio Regis
Christianissimi.”</p>
<p>Anything more perfect than these precious volumes it would be hard to conceive of,
and while of course they contain the errors of chronology et cetera of their age, yet their
general accuracy and marvellous completeness leave them even to-day as the greatest of the
great, although the later edition of Hardouin is more often used by English and American
scholars, and is the one quoted by Pope Benedict XIV. in his famous work De Synodo
Diæcesana. Hardouin’s edition did certainly correct many of the faults of Labbe and Cossart,
yet had itself many faults and defects which are pointed out by Salmon16 in a long list, although
he fully acknowledges the value of Hardouin’s improvements and additions. Perhaps,
not unnaturally, as a Professor at the Sorbonne, he preferred Labbe and Cossart. It may not
be amiss to add that Hardouin was very anti-Gallican and ultramontane.</p>
<p>The Dominican Archbishop of Lucca, Mansi, in 1759, put out his “Concilia” in thirtyone
volumes folio at Florence, styled on the title-page “the most ample” edition ever printed,
and claiming to contain all the old and much new matter. It was never finished, only
reaching to the XVth century, has no indices, and (says Hefele) “is very inferior to Hardouin
in accuracy. The order of the subjects in the later volumes is sometimes not sufficiently
methodical, and is at variance with the chronology.”17</p>
<p>I shall now present the reader with some bibliographical notes which I extract verbatim
from Hefele (Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. I., p. 74).</p>

history of the councils. Salmon, l. c., p. 387, and Walch in his Historie der Kirchenversammlungen,

councils. There are also very valuable dissertations on the same subject in—</p>

to the Study of the Councils, in his Traité de l’Étude des Conciles et de leurs collections, Paris,
1724, in 4to, which has often been reprinted.</p>
<p>To these I would add the following:</p>
<p>1. Fleury, Histoire Ecclesiastique. This work in many volumes, part of which has been
translated into English, is most useful and accurate, and contains a resumé of the separate
canons and definitions as well as the history of the proceedings.</p>
<p>2. Denziger, Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum quæ de rebus fidei et morum a
Conciliis OEcumenicis et Summis Pontificibus emanarunt. A most useful handbook in the
original.</p>
<p>3. Hefele, Conciliengeschicte. This, the most recent work upon the subject, is also in
some respects the most satisfactory, and it is a matter of real regret that only the first part
of the work, down to the end of the Seventh OEcumenical Council, has been translated into
English. The last volume of the author’s revised edition appeared in 1890. The first volume
of the first edition was published in 1855, and the seventh and last in 1874. The entire book
was translated into French some years ago (with full indices) by M. l’abbé Goschlerand and
M. l’abbé Delarc (Paris, Adrien le Clere et Cie). It should in fairness, however, be remarked
that Bishop Hefele was one of the minority who opposed the opportuneness of the definition
of Papal infallibility at the Vatican Council, and while indeed afterwards he submitted to
the final decree, yet he has been a somewhat suspected person since to those who held extreme
views on this doctrine.</p>
<p>So far as I am aware no serious work has been done upon the councils by any writer
using the English tongue in recent times, with the exception of the useful Notes on the
Canons of the First Four General Councils, by Canon Wm. Bright.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the English translations which I have consulted or followed:

<p>It only remains that I mention two other works.

the Council of Constantinople, 381 (1857) should not be omitted, and certainly the reader’s

<head>Appended Note on the Eastern Editions of Synodical Literature.</head>
<p>From the presses of the East, especially those at Athens, a number of editions more or
less complete of the Greek text of the Canons of the Ecumenical and of the Local Councils
have been issued, and the notes of Balsamon, Zonaras, and Aristenus have been added in
some cases. Professor Bolotoff writes however that so far as Greek literature on the subject
is concerned, with the exception of purely topographical researches in the environs of
Constantinople, it is simply putting into Greek what was originally in German.</p>
<p>The Russian Church has done somewhat more and as will be seen from the following
table, some attempts have been made at providing scholia, but when the scheme of this
present work was shewn him, Professor Bolotoff said: “We have nothing analogous to this
undertaking in Russia.” The learned professor remarks that all the best Russian literature
upon the subject is contained in magazine articles, especially those of Professor Zaozersky
of the Moscow Theological Academy, and of Professor A. S. Pavloff, of the University of
Moscow; he mentions also the latter’s article in the Orthodox Review, and adds that “An
Essay on a Course of Church Legislation,” by Joann Smolensk (St. Petersburg, 1851) should
be referred to.</p>

<head>A Bibliographical Index of the Printed Editions of the Canons of the
Apostles and of the Councils in the Slavonic and Russian Languages.</head>
<p>(Prepared by Nicolas Glubokoffski, Professor of the Chair of the Holy Scriptures of the
New Testament in the Ecclesiastical Academy of St. Petersburgh.)21</p>
<p>In the orthodox Russian Church, editions of the Conciliar Canons and Decrees have
only been issued under the immediate disposition and sanction of the supreme ecclesiastical
authority, and, in fact, are amongst those things which it is not within the competence of
private scholars to undertake. Such editions therefore have been published in Russia only
in accordance with practical requirements.</p>
<p>1. The earliest printed edition of the afore-mentioned canons appeared in the Slavonic
“Kormchaja Kniga”22 (=Gk. πηδάλιον), the printing of which was commenced at Moscow,
on October 7th, 1649, under the Patriarch Joseph of Moscow, and was finished on July 1,
1650; but the Patriarch Nicon caused it to be submitted to a Council for revision, in consequence
of which certain pages were reprinted and inserted afresh into it.23 Thereupon
copies of this “Kormchaja” were distributed for use amongst the churches, and came into
general circulation not earlier than the year 1653. The second edition of the “Kormchaja”
appeared in 1787, after a revision under the Metropolitan Gabriel of Novgorod and St.
Petersburgh,24 and was followed by others (e.g., those of 1804, 1816, and 1823) without any
alterations of importance. The latest editions differ from that of Nicon in certain particulars,
but these particulars do not concern the ecclesiastical Canons, which are placed in the first
part of the “Kormchaja” and include the 85 Apostolic Canons, the decrees of the sixteen
councils (of Nicæa, Ancyra, Neocæsarea, Gangra, Antioch, Laodicea, the 2d, 3d, and 4th
Ecumenical, Sardica, Carthage, Constantinople under Nectarius, in Trullo, a.d. 692, the 7th
Ecumenical, the First-and-Second [council of Constantinople] and that in the church of St.
Sophia) and the Canons of the 13 Holy Fathers.</p>
<p>2. In the printed “Kormchaja” the canons are set forth, not in their full text, but in a
shortened form which sometimes gives but a very insufficient representation of the contents
of the original. On this account attempts at full translations were made many years back,
<note type="footnote">21 Translated into English by W. J. Birkbeck, Esq., F.S.A.</note>
<note type="footnote">22 Steering-Book. W.J.B.</note>
<note type="footnote">23 Accordingly some bibliographers correctly reckon this as two editions, of which that of 1653 in folio consists
of 37 + 1 + 60 + 1 + 16 + 679 pages, and was reprinted by the “Old Ritualists” (Rascolniki*), in 1785 at Warsaw.
*Rascolniki, lit. Schismatics; i.e., the Russian Dissenting sects which in the 17th century left the Church rather
than accept the service-books as corrected by the Patriarch Nicon.—W.J.B.
24 This edition was published at Moscow in folio in two parts and volumes, in the 1st there are 2 unnumbered
+ 38 + 5 – 60 + 300 + 39 numbered pages; in the 2d 1 + 2 + 235 + 16 + 37 pages.</note>

<pb n="27"/>
but these never appeared in print. It was not until 1839 that such an edition as this was put
forth by the Holy Synod at St. Petersburgh, under the title: “The Book of the Canons of the
Holy Apostles, of the Holy Ecumenical and local Councils, and of the Holy Fathers,” printed
in large folio in “the Imperial city of St. Peter, the first impression in the 7347th year from
the creation of the world, and the 1839th from the Birth in the flesh of God the Word, indict.
12.” In this edition there are 4 unnumbered leaves and 455 numbered pages. On each page
there are two columns, for the original text and the new translation of the whole text into
the Slavonic respectively, but without the commentaries of the Byzantine Canonists; occasionally,
but rarely, notes based upon Zonaras or Balsamon are given, which are not always
historically accurate (for instance, that to the 10th Canon of Ancyra, the 3d of Sardica, the
4th of Carthage, and the one which deals with the First-and-Second Council of a.d. 861)
while in some places the text itself is not correct (for instance, in the 13th Canon of the 1st
Ecumenical Council). This “Book of the Canons” subsequently went through the following
editions: the 2d, printed in Moscow at the Synodal Press in 1862, in folio 8 leaves + 672 +
74 numbered pages, with Greek and Slavonic texts; the 3d ibid. in 1866, in quarto, 3 leaves
+ 373 pages + 1 leaf + 59 pages, with the Slavonic text only; the 4th, ibid. in 1874, in octavo,
4 leaves 4 + 455 pages + 2 leaves + 104 + 4 pages, also with the Slavonic text only; the 5th,
ibid. in 1886, in folio, 3 leaves + 395 + 42 pages + 1 leaf, again with Slavonic text only.</p>
<p>3. The “Book of Canons” by no means represents an authorized textus receptus, and
after its publication, the Holy Synod itself not unfrequently introduced the Canons as given
in the Slavonic edition of the “Kormchaja Kniga” into its edicts, and moreover recommended
the Athenian Edition of the “Syntagma” for all the ecclesiastico-educational establishments.
This opened the way for a new work, which, with the permission of the supreme ecclesiastical
authority, was undertaken by the Moscow “Society of Amateurs of Spiritual Enlightenment.”
The announcement of this was made in No. 3 of the “Moscow Diocesan Church
Gazette” of the year 1875, whilst in the same year in the January number of the Moscow
Journal, “Lectures delivered in the Society of Amateurs of Spiritual Enlightenment,” the
“programe” of the edition itself was printed (pages 79–90 in the section devoted to bibliography).
In criticism of it the Professor of Canonical Law in the University of Novorossiisk,
Alexis Stepanovich Pavloff (who died on August 16, 1898, as Professor of the University of
Moscow) wrote “Notes on the programme of an edition, in a Russian translation of the
Canons of the Church with Commentaries” in the sixteenth volume of “Memoirs of the
Imperial University of Novorossiisk” (Odessa, 1875), pages 1–17 of the Appendix (and in
a separate pamphlet), which was afterwards reprinted with certain additions in the Moscow
Journal, “Orthodox Review,” of April, 1876 (pages 730–746), under the title: “A new
translation of the Commentaries upon the canons of the church.” To these criticisms the

<pb n="28"/>
Professor of Ecclesiastical Law in the Moscow Ecclesiastical Academy, Alexander
Theodorovich Lavroff, wrote a reply in “Lectures delivered in the Society of Amateurs of
Spiritual Enlightenment” (for the year 1877, part 2, pages 158–194), entitled “A printed
letter to Alexis Stepanovich Pavloff.” Thus the plan of the edition gradually took shape. It
was first printed in the Appendices to the Journal “Lectures in the Society, etc.,” and subsequently
was published separately in octavo in the following parts (A) I. “The Canons of
the Holy Apostles with Commentaries” in two editions—Moscow, 1876, (from “Lectures,”
1875, pages 1–163) 4 + 12 + 175 pages, and ibid., 1887, 5–12 + 163 pages; II. “Canons of the
Holy Ecumenical Councils with Commentaries” (from “Lectures” 1875, pages 165–325;
1876, pages 329–680; 1877, pages 891–900), in two parts: 1st “The Canons of the Councils
I.–IV.,” Moscow, 1877, 260 pages; 2d. “The Canons of Councils V.–VII.,” ibid., 736 pages;
(B) “The Canons of the Holy Local Councils with Commentaries,” also in two parts (from
“Lectures” 1877, pages 900–1066; 1878, pages 1067–1306; 1879, pages 1307–1410): the 1st
(The Canons of the Councils of Ancyra, Neocæsarea, Gangra, Antioch, Laodicea, and
Sardica) Moscow, 1880, 359 pages; the 2d (The Canons of the Councils of Carthage [with
the letters to Pope Boniface and to Pope Celestine], Constantinople, the First-and-Second,
and that in the Temple of the Wisdom of the Word of God) ibid., 1881, 876 pages; (C) “The
Canons of the Holy Fathers with Commentaries,” ibid., 1884, 626 pages. Together with
these is a separate “Index of subjects contained in the edition of the Canons of the Apostles,
Councils and Holy Fathers with Commentaries,” Moscow, 1888, 58 pages in octavo. The
Greek text of the canons follows the edition Σύνταγμα τῶν θείων καὶ ὶερῶν κανόνων…ὑπὸ
Γ. Α. Ράλλη καὶ Μ. Πότλη, Αθήνησιν 1852–1854, and alongside of it is placed a literal
Slavonic translation, after which follows a Russian translation of the Commentaries of the
Byzantine Canonists (Zonaras, Aristenus, Balsamon), and the text and commentaries of the
Slavonic “Kormchaja;” all this is accompanied by introductions and explanations of all sorts
(historical, philological, etc.). This edition is rightly considered by specialists to be of very
great value from a scientific point of view. Professor A. Th. Lavroff (who became a monk
under the name Alexis, and died Archbishop of Lithuania and Vilna) was its chief editor
and had most to do with it, but many others took part in the work, and amongst these Professor
A. S. Pavloff.</p>
<p>4. The only Russian translation of the canons which exists is contained in the publications
of the Ecclesiastical Academy of Kazan: (a) “The Acts of the Ecumenical Councils
translated into Russian,” 7 volumes. Kazan, 1859–1878 (some of these volumes have run
into a second edition) and (b) “Acts of the nine local councils translated into Russian,” 1
volume, Kazan, 1878. This translation was made under the direction of the Holy Synod,
and the Canons are reproduced in it according to the text of the Acts of the Councils.</p>
<p>From the outline here presented of the printed editions of the Canons of the Councils,
it will be seen that, within the limits of their practical applicability, they are reverenced as

the source of the operative law in the Russian orthodox church, and therefore for her it is
only the authoritative Byzantine commentaries which have any particular importance.
There are works upon these by V. Demidoff, “The character and significance of the commentaries
upon the Canonical Codex of the Greek Church—of Aristenus, Zonaras, and
Balsamon,” in the “Orthodox Review,” vol. ii. of 1888, and of Professor V. A. Narbekoff, of
Kazan, “The commentaries of Balsamon upon the Nomocanon of Photius,” Kazan, 1889,
and of Professor M. E. Krasnozhen, of Jurieff (Dorpat) “The Commentators of the Canonical
Codex of the Eastern Church: Aristenus, Zonaras, and Balsamon.” Moscow, 1892.</p>
<p>No separate scientific commentaries upon all the canons of the councils exist in Russian
literature, but they are described, and explained in courses of Ecclesiastical law (of the
Archimandrite John <del>who, when he died, was Bishop of Smolensk</del> of Professors N. S. Suxxviii
voroff, T. S. Berdnikoff, N. A. Lashkareff, M. A. Ostroümoff) in our works upon the history
of the Ecumenical Councils (by Bishop John, and Professor Alexis Petrovich Lebedeff), and
in monographs dealing with Canon Law and Church History. As far as a critical edition of
the original text of the canons is concerned, there is a learned and useful article (upon a
book by Fr. Lauchert, Die Kanones usw., Freiberg i. Br. und Leipsig, 1896), by Vasili Vasilievich
Bolotoff, Professor of Ecclesiastical History in the St. Petersburgh Ecclesiastical
Academy in the “Christian Reading,” vol. iv. for 1896, pp. 178–195.</p>

<head>Excursus on the History of the Roman Law and Its Relation
to the Canon Law.</head>
<p>The foregoing bibliographical outline would be entirely incomplete did I not give the
reader at least a sketch of how those canons adopted by the various councils gradually won
admission to the law-code of the Empire, and how that code itself came into being. For
those wishing to study the matter in detail I would name as the most recent authorities upon
the Roman Law, Mr. Muirhead, who has published with additions and notes his article on
the subject in the “Encyclopædia Britannica,” and Mr. Bury’s new edition of Gibbon’s Rome
just being issued with most learned notes.</p>
<p>But neither of these writers has put the matter exactly as I desire for this purpose, and
I have therefore been forced to seek elsewhere the information I now lay before the reader.
The study of Jurisprudence did not form a separate department among the ancient
Greeks, but among the Romans it was quite otherwise, and a very elaborate system was developed,
so elaborate as to demand the care of a special class of men, who devoted themselves
to this business alone and handed down to their successors a constantly increasing mass of
legal matter.</p>
<p>When Greece fell under the Roman yoke the laws of the victor were imposed upon the
vanquished, but even then the Greeks did not take to legal studies. In fact not until the seat
of the Empire was removed to Constantinople did the East become a centre of jurisprudence
or the residence of the chief legal experts. In the whole period before the fourth century of
our era we know of but one barrister who wrote in Greek, and he came from the West,
Herennius Modestinus. He was a disciple of Ulpian and preceptor to the Emperor Maximian
the Younger.</p>
<p>From the time of Hadrian to that of Alexander Severus the influence of the legal schools
of Rome had been paramount. The Emperors consulted them and asked them to decide
difficult points. But after the death of Alexander this custom fell into entire disuse, and the
Emperors themselves decided the matters formerly entrusted to the lawyers. After this time
the Imperial Constitutions became the chief sources of Roman law. It is only in the time of
Constantine the Great that we find once again the lawyers rising into prominence and a
flourishing school at Beyroot in Syria. It was at this time that the Imperial Constitutions
or Edicts were first collected, for until then they existed only in detached documents. This
collection was made by two lawyers, Gregory or Gregorian, and Hermogenes. Gregory’s
collection contains the laws set forth from the time of Hadrian to Constantine, and Hermogenes
wrote a supplement. Although this was but a private enterprise, yet it was cited in
the courts of law, just as Lord Lyndwood’s Provinciale is with us to-day.</p>

<pb n="31"/>
<p>It is interesting to note that it was about this same time that the first attempt was made
to collect the ecclesiastical canons, and so the Civil Law and the Canon Law (as we know
them in after times) had their rise about the same period.</p>
<p>The law of the Empire was not, however, to be left to private and unofficial action, but
by the care of Theodosius the Younger its first official collection was made. This prince
directed eight men learned in the law to gather into one body of laws all the Imperial Constitutions
published since the last included in the collections of Gregory and Hermogenes.
This is the “Theodosian Code,” and contains the laws set forth by Constantine and his successors.
It was promulgated in 438 in the East, and received by the then Emperor of the
West, Valentinian III. To this were subsequently added such laws as each set forth, under
the title of “New Constitutions.”</p>
<p>The Emperor Justinian determined still further to simplify the attaining of judicial decisions.
It is true that the making of the legal collections referred to had added greatly to
the ease of determining the law in any given case, but there was a source of great confusion
in the endless number of legal decisions which by custom had acquired the force of law, and
which were by no means always consistent between themselves; these were the famous responsa
jurisperitorum. To clear up this difficulty was no small task, but the Emperor went
about it in the most determined fashion and appointed a commission, consisting of
Tribonian and ten other experts, to make a new collection of all the imperial constitutions
from Hadrian to his own day. This is the famous Justinian Code, which was promulgated
in 529, and abrogated all previous collections.25</p>
<p>This, however, was not sufficient to remove the difficulty, and Tribonian next, together
with sixteen lawyers, spent three years in making extracts from the great mass of decisions
of the ancient jurists, filling as they did nearly two thousand volumes. These they digested
and did their best to clear away the contradictions. When the work was finished it appeared
to the world as the “Pandects,” because it was intended to contain all there was to be said
upon the subject. It is also known as the “Digest.” This work was set forth in 533 and from
that time such of the former decisions as were not incorporated ceased to have any force.</p>
<p>It must however be remembered that, while this was the case, all the decisions contained
in the Pandects did not obtain the force of law. The Pandects are not a code of laws, but a
system of public jurisprudence composed by public authority. To the Pandects were added
by the Emperor two ordinances, the first to forbid any copyist to write them in an abbreviated

after its publication in Latin, issued (perhaps incompletely) in a Greek form (cf. Zacharia Von Lingenthal, Gr.
Röm. Recht, p. 6). Most of the later Novels are Greek, and Novel vij. [15, ed. Zach.] expressly recognizes the
necessity of using ‘the common Greek tongue.’”</note>

form; and the second forbidding commentators to treat them in anything but their literal
sense.</p>
<p>While this work was in progress some points were so complicated and obscure that the
Emperor had to be appealed to, and his writings in these particulars are the origin of the
“Fifty Decisions.”</p>
<p>At the same time was prepared the “Institutes,” containing the elements of the whole
Roman law.26</p>
<p>Later, new laws having been made, the Code had to be revised; the former edition was
abrogated in 534, and a new one set forth with the title “Codex repetitæ prælectionis.”</p>
<p>The last of Justinian’s labours in the field of jurisprudence (if indeed they were not collected
after his death) are his “Novels,” a series of imperial constitutions issued between 535
and 559 (Νεαραὶ Διατάξεις). There are one hundred and sixty-eight of these Novels, but
the ancient glosses only know ninety-seven, and the rest have been added since, as they have
been found.</p>
<p>Such is the origin of the Corpus Juris Civilis, and its history needed to be set forth in
this place on account of its close connection with the Corpus Juris Canonici. In the foregoing
I have followed M. Schoell in his admirable Histoire de la Littérature Grecque Profane, to
which I am also chiefly indebted for the following notes upon the jurists of the sixth and
ensuing centuries.</p>
<p>A work which is often looked upon as the origin of the Canon Law was composed by a
lawyer of Antioch, somewhere near the middle of the sixth century. This jurist was John
of Antioch, surnamed Scholasticus. He was representative or apocrisiarius of the Church
of Antioch at Constantinople, and afterward was made Patriarch of that see, over which he
ruled from 564 until his death in 578. While still a simple priest at Antioch he made his
Collection of the Canons of the Councils.</p>
<p>“He was not the first who conceived the idea of such a work. Some writers, resting upon
a passage in Socrates, have been of opinion that this honour belonged to Sabinus, bishop of
Heraclea, in Thrace, at the beginning of the fifth century; but Socrates is not speaking of a
collection of canons at all, but of the synodal acts, of the letters written by or addressed to
the synods. If, however, Sabinus did not make a collection of canons, it is certain nevertheless
that before John of Antioch there existed one, for he himself cites it many times, although
he does not name the authors.”27</p>
<p>“In gathering together thus the canons of the councils John of Antioch did not form a
complete body of ecclesiastical law. By his Novel CXLI., Justinian had indeed given to the

of the Institutes.</note>

<pb n="33"/>
canons of the Church the force of law, but he himself published a great number of constitutions
upon Church matters. Now it was necessary to harmonize these constitutions and
canons, and to accomplish this feat was the object of a second work undertaken by John of
Antioch, to which he gave the title of Nomocanon (Νομοκάνων ),28 a word which from
that time has served to designate any collection of this sort.”29</p>
<p>Bury says, “In the troubles of the VIIth century the study of law, like many other things,
declined, and in the practical administration of justice the prescriptions of the Code and
Digest were often ignored or modified by the alien precepts of Christianity. The religion
of the Empire had exerted but very slight influence—no fundamental influence, we may
say—on the Justinian law. Leo III., the founder of the Syrian (vulgarly called Isaurian)
dynasty, when he restored the Empire after a generation of anarchy, saw the necessity of
legislation to meet the changed circumstances of the time. The settlements of foreigners—
Slavs and Mardaites—in the provinces of the Empire created an agrarian question,
which he dealt with in his Agrarian Code. The increase of Slavonic and Saracenic piracy
demanded increased securities for maritime trade, and this was dealt with in a Navigation
Code. But it was not only for special relations that Leo made laws; he legislated also, and
in an entirely new way, for the general relations of life. He issued a law book (in a.d. 740 in
the name of himself and his son Constantine), which changed and modified the Roman
law, as it had been fixed by Justinian. The Ecloga,30 as it is called, may be described as a
Christian law book. It is a deliberate attempt to change the legal system of the Empire by
an application of Christian principles. Examples, to illustrate its tendency, will be given
below. The horror in which the iconoclasts were held on account of their heresy by the
image-worshippers, cast discredit upon all their works. This feeling had something to do
with the great reaction, which was inaugurated by Basil I., against their legal reforms. The
Christian Code of Leo prevailed in the empire for less than a century and a half; and then,
under the auspices of Basil, the Roman law of Justinian was (partially) restored. In legal
activity the Basilian epoch faintly reflected the epoch of Justinian itself. A handbook of extracts
from the Institutes, Digest, Code, and Novels, was published in a.d. 879, entitled the
Prochiron, to diffuse a knowledge of the forgotten system. But the great achievement of
the Basilian epoch is the ‘Basilica’—begun under Basil, completed under Leo VI.—a huge
collection of all the laws of the Empire, not only those still valid, but those which had become
obsolete. It seems that two commissions of experts were appointed to prepare the material
for this work. One of these commissions compiled the Prochiron by the way, and planned

out the Basilica in sixty Books. The other commission also prepared a handbook called the
Epanagoge, which was never actually published (though a sketch of the work is extant), and
planned out the Basilica in forty Books. The Basilica, as actually published, are arranged in
sixty Books, compiled from the materials prepared by both commissions.</p>
<p>“The Basilian revival of Justinianean law was permanent; and it is outside our purpose
to follow the history further, except to note the importance of the foundation of a school of
law at Constantinople in the 11th century by the Emperor Constantine IX. The law enacting
the institution of this school, under the direction of a salaried Nomophylax, is extant. John
Xiphilin (see above) was the first director. This foundation may have possibly had some
influence on the institution of the school at Bologna half a century later.”31</p>
<p>I take from Schoell the following description of the “Basilica”:</p>
<p>“The ‘Basilica’ are a body of Roman law in the Greek language, extracted from the Instixxxii
tutes, the Pandects, the Codes and the Novels of Justinian as well as from the Imperial
Constitutions posterior to that prince; also extracts from the interpretations of such jurists
as had won a fixed authority in the courts, and the canons of the councils. Here is found
together the civil and the ecclesiastical law of the Greeks, these two laws having been in an
intimate union by reason of the authority which the Emperors exercised over the Church;
on the other hand, in the West there was formed step by step a canon law separate from the
civil law, and having a different source.”32</p>
<p>Such, then, were the “Basilica,” but what is most singular is that this collection was not
given the force of law, neither by Leo VI. nor by Constantine VI., although it was prepared
at their order, under their authority, and was written in the language which was spoken by
their subjects. The Justinian code of law, although in Latin, still continued to be the only
authority in the entire East. An anonymous writer prepared an Epitome of the Basilica, digested
into Alphabetical order, and beginning with “Of the Orthodox faith of Christians.”</p>
<p>In 883 Photius published a “Syntagma canonum” and a “Nomocanon” with the title
Προκανὼν, because it was placed before the canons. This last work at the command of
Constantine VI. was revised and soon took the place of the Nomocanon of John of Antioch,
over which work it had the advantage of being more recent and of being digested in better
order. In citing the canons, only the titles are given; but the text of the civil laws appears in
full. “As in the Eastern Church the influence of the imperial authority increased at the expense
of that of the councils, and as these princes made ecclesiastical affairs a principal part
of their government, it came to pass that the Nomocanon of Photius became of more frequent
and more necessary use than his Syntagma, [which contained the actual text of the canons
of the councils down to 880]. Many commentators busied themselves with it, while the
<note type="footnote">31 Appendix to Vol. V. of Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, pp. 525 and 526.</note>
<note type="footnote">32 Schoell, ut supra, p. 229. The best edition of the Basilica is by W. E. Heimbach in 6 vols. (1833–70).</note>

<pb n="35"/>
collection of the councils was neglected. Thus it has happened that the Nomocanon has
become the true foundation of the ecclesiastical law of the East.”33</p>
<p>But while this is true, yet there were not lacking commentators upon the Canon law,
and of the three chiefest of these some notice must be taken in this place. As I have already
pointed out it is to Bishop Beveridge that we owe the publication not only of Photius’s
Collection of Canons which are found in his “Συνοδικὸν sive Pandectæ,” but also of the
scholia of all three of these great commentators, Zonaras, Aristenus, and Balsamon, and
from his most learned Prolegomena to the same work I have chiefly drawn the following
facts, referring the curious reader to the introduction34 itself for further particulars.</p>
<p>John Zonaras was probably the same person who wrote the Byzantine History which
bears his name. He flourished under Alexis Comnenus, and enjoyed the high office of Grand
Drungarius Viglæ (Δρουγγαριος τῆς Βίγλης) and Chief of the Clerks. After some years of
secular life he retired to a monastery and devoted himself to literary pursuits. While here,
at the command of his superiors, and moved by the persuasion of his friends, he wrote that
great book which has made his fame, which he entitled “An Exposition of the Sacred and
Divine Canons, as well those of the holy and venerable Apostles, as also those of the sacred
OEcumenical Synods, and those of the local or particular councils, and those of the rest of
the Holy Fathers; by the labour of John Zonaras the monk, who was formerly Grand
Drungarius Viglæ and Chief of the Clerks.”35</p>
<p>One of the greatest peculiarities of this work, and one which distinguishes it very
markedly from the later work of Balsamon upon the same subject, is that Zonaras confines
himself strictly to the canon law and rarely makes any references to the civil law whatever;
and in such canons as bear no relation to the civil law Balsamon often adopts Zonaras’s
notes without change or addition.</p>
<p>These commentaries were first brought to light by John Quintin, a professor of canon
law at Paris, who published a Latin translation of the scholia upon the Apostolic Canons.
This was in 1558. In 1618 Antonius Salmatia edited his commentaries on the canons of the
Councils done into Latin. To this Latin version the Paris press added the Greek text from
the ms. codex in the Royal Library and printed it in 1618. In 1622 the same press issued his
commentaries upon the Epistles of the Holy Fathers, together with those of St. Gregory
Thaumaturgus, Macarius of Egypt, and Basil. But Beveridge collected them in his Oxford
Edition for the first time into one work; preparing a somewhat critical text by collation with
some manuscripts he found at home.</p>

<pb n="36"/>
<p>The second of these great Greek scholiasts is Alexis Aristenus. As Beveridge points out,
he must have flourished before or at the same time as Balsamon, for this latter speaks of
him in high terms of commendation in his scholion on the Sixth of the Apostolic Canons,
describing him as τον ὑπέρτιμον. Aristenus was Nomophylax, Orphanotrophe and Protecdekas,
or chief of the Syndics of the Communes, called Ecdics (῎Εκδικοι). He wrote the
excellent series of notes upon the Epitomes of the Canons which are given the reader in
Beveridge’s Pradects. Schoell says that it is an error to attribute to him the “Extract of the
Ancient Ecclesiastical Laws,” “which is none of his.”36 Aristenus was Grand Economus of
the Church of Constantinople and a man of great distinction; and his opinion was sought
after and his decision followed even when in opposition to one of the Patriarchs, viz.:
Nicephorus of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Beveridge was the first to print Aristenus’s Scholia, and he did so from four mss., in
England, for a description of which I refer the reader to the bishop’s prolegomena.37
Theodore Balsamon is the last of the three great Greek scholiasts. He flourished in the
time of the Emperor Isaac Angelus and bore the title of Patriarch of Antioch, although at
that time the city was in the hands of the Latins and had been so since 1100. He was looked
upon as the greatest jurist of his times both in ecclesiastical and civil matters. Somewhere
about the year 1150, he wrote by the order of Manuel Comnenus a series of “Scholia upon
the Nomocanon of Photius,” and another set styled “Scholia upon the Canons of the Apostles,
of the Councils and of the Fathers of the Church;” he also prepared a “Collection of [imperial]
Constitutions upon ecclesiastical matters,”38 in three books, which has been published
(by Loewenklaw) at Frankfort, 1595, under the title “Paratitles.” There remains also a great
number of his opinions on cases presented to him, notably his “answers to sixty-four canonical
questions by Mark, Patriarch of Alexandria.”</p>
<p>These most learned writings were unknown and forgotten, at least in the West, until
they were set forth in a Latin translation during the time the Council of Trent was sitting,
in 1561, and not till 1620 did the Greek text appear in the Paris edition of that date. But
this text was imperfect and corrupt, and Beveridge produced a pure text from an Oxford
ms., with which he compared several others. Moreover in his Pandects he amended the
Latin text as well in numberless particulars. For further, particulars of the bibliography of
the matter see Beveridge.39</p>
<p>It may not be amiss to add that abundant proof of the high esteem in which Balsamon
was held is found in contemporary authors, and no words can give an exaggerated idea of

the weight of his opinion on all legal matters, religious and profane; his works were undertaken
at the command of the Emperor and of the Patriarch, and were received with an unmixed
admiration.40</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century a certain Chumnus who had been Nomophylax and was afterwards
elevated to the Archiepiscopal chair of Thessalonica wrote a little book on the “Degrees
of Relationship.”41</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century we find Matthew Blastares writing “An Alphabetical Table”42
of the contents of the canons of the councils, and of the laws of the Emperors.</p>
<p>And in the same century we find Constantine Harmenopulus, who was born in 1320.
He was, when thirty years of age, a member of the first court of civil justice (Judex Dromi).
Subsequently he was appointed Counsellor of the Emperor, John Cantacuzene, and finally
Sebastos and Curopalatos under John Paleologus. In the year 1345 he published a “Manual
of Jurisprudence.”43 This work is of great value to the student of Roman law as he completes
the work of the Emperor Basil by adding the imperial constitutions since that time. But our
chief concern with him is as the author of an “Epitome of the Divine and Sacred Canons.”44</p>
<p>Constantine Harmenopulus was the last Greek jurist, and then Constantinople fell, to
the everlasting disgrace of a divided Christendom, into the hands of the Infidel, and the law
of the false Prophet supplanted the Roman Law, the Code of Civilization and Christianity.</p>
<p>I pass now to the history of the growth of the canon law in the West. No one reading
even cursorily the canons contained in the present volume can fail to notice that, with the
exception of those of the African code, they are primarily intended for the government of
the East and of persons more immediately under the shadow of the imperial city. In fact in
the canons of the Council in Trullo and in those of the Seventh Synod there are places which
not even covertly are attacks, or at least reflections, upon the Western customs of the time.
And it does not seem to be an unjust view of the matter to detect in the Council of Chalcedon
and its canon on the position of the See of Rome, a beginning of that unhappy spirit which
found its full expression in that most lamentable breaking off of communion between East
and West.</p>

appeared an edition in Greek and Latin.</note>

<pb n="38"/>
<p>While, then, as I have pointed out, in the East the Canon Law was developed and digested
side by side and in consonance with the civil law, in the West the state of things was wholly
different, and while in secular matters the secular power was supposed to be supreme, there
grew up a great body of Ecclesiastical Law, often at variance with the secular decrees upon
the subject. To trace this, step by step, is no part of my duty in this excursus, and I shall
only give so brief an outline that the reader may be able to understand the references in the
notes which accompany the Canons in the text.</p>
<p>Somewhere about the year 500 Dionysius Exiguus, who was Abbot of a Monastery in
Rome, translated a collection of Greek Canons into Latin for Bishop Stephen of Salona. At
the head of these he placed fifty of what we now know as the “Canons of the Apostles,” but
it must not be supposed that he was convinced of their Apostolic origin, for in the Preface
to his translation he expressly styles them “Canons which are said to be by the Apostles,”
and adds “quibus plurimi consensum non proebuere facilem.”45 To these he added the
canons of Chalcedon with those that council had accepted, viz., those of Sardica, and a large
number passed by African Synods, and lastly the Papal Decretals from Siricius to Anastasius
II.</p>
<p>The next collection is that of St. Isidore of Seville, or which is supposed to have been
made by him, early in the seventh century.</p>
<p>About the middle of the ninth century there appeared a collection bearing the name of
Isidore Mercator, and containing the “false decretals” which have been so fruitful a theme
of controversial writing. This collection was made somewhere about the year 850, and
possibly at Mayence. Many writers in treating of these decretals, which are undoubtedly
spurious, seem to forget that they must have expressed the prevailing opinions of the day
in which they were forged, of what those early Popes would have been likely to have said,
and that therefore even forgeries as they certainly are, they have a great historical value
which no sound scholar can properly neglect.</p>
<p>After the collection of St. Isidore we have no great collection till that of Gratian in 1151.
Gratian was a Benedictine monk, and he styled his work “A Reconciling of contradictory
canons” (Concordantia discordantium Canonum), which well sets forth what his chief object
in view was, but his work had a great future before it, and all the world knows it as “Gratian’s
Decretum,” and with it begins the “collections” of Canon law, if we consider it as a system
in present force.</p>
<note type="footnote">45 Hefele points out that Dr. von Drey’s contention that “plurimi” refers to the Greeks cannot be sustained
if it is pushed so far as to exclude from the West an acquaintance with these canons in their Greek form, for, as
he well points out, Greek was a perfectly well understood language at this time in the West, especially in Italy,
where it was largely spoken. (A Hist. Christ. Councils, Vol. I. Appendix, p. 449.)</note>

<pb n="39"/>
<p>“This great work is divided into three parts. The first part, in 101 ‘Distinctions,’ treats
of ecclesiastical law, its origin, principles, and authority, and then of the different ranks and
duties of the clergy. The second part, in thirty-six ‘Causes,’ treats of ecclesiastical courts
and their forms of procedure. The third part, usually called ‘De Consecratione,’ treats of
things and rites employed in the service of religion. From its first appearance the Decretum
obtained a wide popularity, but it was soon discovered that it contained numerous errors,
which were corrected under the directions of successive Popes down to Gregory XIII. Nor,
although every subsequent generation has resorted to its pages, is the Decretum an authority
to this day—that is, whatever canons or maxims of law are found in it possess only that degree
of legality which they would possess if they existed separately; their being in the Decretum
gives them no binding force. In the century after Gratian, several supplementary collections
of Decretals appeared. These, with many of his own, were collected by the orders of Gregory
IX., who employed in the work the extraordinary learning and acumen of St. Raymond of
Pennafort, into five books, known as the Decretals of Gregory IX. These are in the fullest
sense authoritative, having been deliberately ratified and published by that Pope (1234).
The Sext, or sixth book of the Decretals, was added by Boniface VIII. (1298). The Clementines
are named after Clement V., who compiled them out of the canons of the Council of Vienne
(1316) and some of his own constitutions. The Extravagantes of John XXII., who succeeded
Clement V., and the Extravagantes Communes, containing the decretals of twenty-five Popes,
ending with Sixtus IV. (1484), complete the list. Of these five collections—namely the Decretals,
the Sext, the Clementines, the Extravagants of John XXII. and the Extravagants
Common—the ‘Corpus Juris Ecclesiastici’ of the West is made up.”46</p>
<p>Into this body of canon law of course many of the canons we shall have to treat of in
the following pages have been incorporated and so far as possible I shall give the reader a
reference which will help his research in this particular.</p>

<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>The history of the Council of Nice has been so often written by so many brilliant historians,
from the time of its sitting down to to-day, that any historical notice of the causes
leading to its assembling, or account of its proceedings, seems quite unnecessary. The editor,
however, ventures to call the attention of the reader to the fact that in this, as in every other
of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, the question the Fathers considered was not what they
supposed Holy Scripture might mean, nor what they, from à priori arguments, thought
would be consistent with the mind of God, but something entirely different, to wit, what
they had received. They understood their position to be that of witnesses, not that of exegetes.
They recognized but one duty resting upon them in this respect—to hand down to
other faithful men that good thing the Church had received according to the command of
God. The first requirement was not learning, but honesty. The question they were called
upon to answer was not, What do I think probable, or even certain, from Holy Scripture?
but, What have I been taught, what has been intrusted to me to hand down to others? When
the time came, in the Fourth Council, to examine the Tome of Pope St. Leo, the question
was not whether it could be proved to the satisfaction of the assembled fathers from Holy
Scripture, but whether it was the traditional faith of the Church. It was not the doctrine of
Leo in the fifth century, but the doctrine of Peter in the first, and of the Church since then,
that they desired to believe and to teach, and so, when they had studied the Tome, they cried
out:47</p>
<p>“This is the faith of the Fathers! This is the faith of the Apostles!…Peter hath thus
spoken by Leo! The Apostles thus taught! Cyril thus taught!” etc.</p>
<p>No Acts of either of the first two Ecumenical Councils have been handed down.48</p>
<note type="footnote">47 This is clearly set forth by Pope Vigilius as follows: “No one can doubt that our fathers believed that they
should receive with veneration the letter of blessed Leo if they declared it to agree with the doctrines of the
Nicene and Constantinopolitan Councils, as also with those of blessed Cyril, set forth in the first of Ephesus.
And if that letter of so great a Pontiff, shining with so bright a light of the orthodox Faith, needed to be approved
by these comparisons, how can that letter to Maris the Persian, which specially rejects the First Council of
Ephesus and declares to be heretics the expressed doctrines of the blessed Cyril, be believed to have been called
orthodox by these same Fathers, condemning as it does those writings, by comparison with which, as we have
said, the doctrine of so great a Pontiff deserved to be commended?”—Vigil., Constitutum pro dammatione Trium

<head>Excursus on the Word Homousios.52</head>
<p>The Fathers of the Council at Nice were at one time ready to accede to the request of
some of the bishops and use only scriptural expressions in their definitions. But, after several
attempts, they found that all these were capable of being explained away. Athanasius
describes with much wit and penetration how he saw them nodding and winking to each
other when the orthodox proposed expressions which they had thought of a way of escaping
from the force of. After a series of attempts of this sort it was found that something clearer
and more unequivocal must be adopted if real unity of faith was to be attained; and accord-
ingly the word homousios was adopted. Just what the Council intended this expression to
mean is set forth by St. Athanasius as follows: “That the Son is not only like to the Father,
but that, as his image, he is the same as the Father; that he is of the Father; and that the resemblance
of the Son to the Father, and his immutability, are different from ours: for in us
they are something acquired, and arise from our fulfilling the divine commands. Moreover,
they wished to indicate by this that his generation is different from that of human nature;
that the Son is not only like to the Father, but inseparable from the substance of the Father,
that he and the Father are one and the same, as the Son himself said: ‘The Logos is always
in the Father, and, the Father always in the Logos,’ as the sun and its splendour are inseparable.”
53</p>
<p>The word homousios had not had, although frequently used before the Council of Nice,
a very happy history. It was probably rejected by the Council of Antioch,54 and was suspected
of being open to a Sabellian meaning. It was accepted by the heretic Paul of Samosata and
this rendered it very offensive to many in the Asiatic Churches.</p>
<p>On the other hand the word is used four times by St. Irenæus, and Pamphilus the Martyr
is quoted as asserting that Origen used the very word in the Nicene sense. Tertullian also
uses the expression “of one substance” (unius substantiæ) in two places, and it would seem
that more than half a century before the meeting of the Council of Nice, it was a common
one among the Orthodox.</p>
<note type="footnote">52 Our older English writers usually wrote this word “homoousion,” and thus spoke of the doctrine as “the
doctrine of the homoousion.” For the Arian word they wrote “homoiousion.” Later writers have used the nominative
masculine, “homoousios” and “homoiousios.” The great Latin writers did not thus transliterate the word,
but, wrote “homousios,” and for the heretical word “homooesios” or “homoesios.” I have kept for the noun signifying
the doctrine, our old English “Homoousion,” but for the adjective, I have used the ordinary latinized form
“homousios,” in this copying Smith and Wace, Dict. Christian Antiquities</note>

<note type="footnote">54 Vide Swainson, in Smith and Wace, Dict. Christ. Biog., sub voce Homousios, p. 134.</note>

<pb n="45"/>
<p>Vasquez treats this matter at some length in his Disputations,55 and points out how well
the distinction is drawn by Epiphanius between Synousios and Homousios, “for synousios
signifies such an unity of substance as allows of no distinction: wherefore the Sabellians
would admit this word: but on the contrary homousios signifies the same nature and substance
but with a distinction between persons one from the other. Rightly, therefore, has
the Church adopted this word as the one best calculated to confute the Arian heresy.”56</p>
<p>It may perhaps be well to note that these words are formed like ὁμόβιος and ὁμοιόβιος,
ὁμογνώμων and ὁμοιογνώμων, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The reader will find this whole doctrine treated at great length in all the bodies of divinity;
and in Alexander Natalis (H. E. t. iv., Diss. xiv.); he is also referred to Pearson, On the Creed;
Bull, Defence of the Nicene Creed; Forbes, An Explanation of the Nicene Creed; and especially

<head>Excursus on the Words γεννηθέντα οὐ ποιηθέντα .</head>
<p>(J. B. Lightfoot. The Apostolic Fathers—Part II. Vol. ii. Sec. I. pp. 90, et seqq.)</p>
<p>The Son is here [Ignat. Ad. Eph. vii.] declared to be γεννητὸς as man and ἀγέννητος as
God, for this is clearly shown to be the meaning from the parallel clauses. Such language
is not in accordance with later theological definitions, which carefully distinguished between
γενητός and γεννητός between ἀγένητος and ἀγέννητος; so that γενητός, ἀγένητος respectively
denied and affirmed the eternal existence, being equivalent to κτιστός, ἄκτιστος, while
γεννητός, ἀγέννητος described certain ontological relations, whether in time or in eternity.
In the later theological language, therefore, the Son was γεννητός even in his Godhead. See
esp. Joann. Damasc. de Fid. Orth. i. 8 <del>where he draws the conclusion that only the Father
is ἀγέννητος, and only the Son γεννητός</del>.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt however, that Ignatius wrote γεννητός καὶ ἀγέννητος, though
his editors frequently alter it into γενητὸς καὶ ἀγένητος. For (1) the Greek ms. still retains
the double [Greek nun] ν, though the claims of orthodoxy would be a temptation to scribes
to substitute the single ν. And to this reading also the Latin genitus et ingenitus points. On
the other hand it cannot be concluded that translators who give factus et non factus had the
words with one ν, for this was after all what Ignatius meant by the double ν, and they would
naturally render his words so as to make his orthodoxy apparent. (2) When Theodoret
writes γεννητὸς ἐξ ἀγεννήτου, it is clear that he, or the person before him who first substituted
this reading, must have read γεννητὸς καὶ ἀγέννητος, for there would be no temptation
to alter the perfectly orthodox γενητὸς καὶ ἀγένητος, nor (if altered) would it have taken
this form. (3) When the interpolator substitutes ὁ μόνος ἄληθινὸς Θεὸς ὁ ἀγέννητος…τοῦ
δὲ μονογονοῦς πατῂρ καὶ γεννήτωρ, the natural inference is that he too, had the forms in
double ν, which he retained, at the same time altering the whole run of the sentence so as
not to do violence to his own doctrinal views; see Bull Def. Fid. Nic. ii. 2 § 6. (4) The quotation
in Athanasius is more difficult. The mss. vary, and his editors write γενητὸς καὶ
ἀγένητος. Zahn too, who has paid more attention to this point than any previous editor of
Ignatius, in his former work (Ign. v. Ant. p. 564), supposed Athanasius to have read and
written the words with a single ν, though in his subsequent edition of Ignatius (p. 338) he
declares himself unable to determine between the single and double ν. I believe, however,
that the argument of Athanasius decides in favour of the νν. Elsewhere he insists repeatedly
on the distinction between κτίζειν and γεννᾶν, justifying the use of the latter term as applied
to the divinity of the Son, and defending the statement in the Nicene Creed γεννητὸν ἐκ
τῆς οὐσίας τοῦ πατρὸς τὸν υἱὸν ὁμοούσιον (De Synod. 54, 1, p. 612). Although he is not
responsible for the language of the Macrostich (De Synod. 3, 1, p. 590), and would have regarded
it as inadequate without the ὁμοούσιον, yet this use of terms entirely harmonizes

<pb n="47"/>
with his own. In the passage before us, ib. §§ 46, 47 (p. 607), he is defending the use of
homousios at Nicæa, notwithstanding that it had been previously rejected by the council
which condemned Paul of Samosata, and he contends that both councils were orthodox,
since they used homousios in a different sense. As a parallel instance he takes the word
ἀγέννητος which like homousios is not a scriptural word, and like it also is used in two ways,
signifying either (1) Τὸ ὂν μεν, μήτε δὲ γεννηθὲν μήτε ὅλως ἔχον τὸν αἴτιον, or (2) Τὸ
ἄκτιστον. In the former sense the Son cannot be called ἀγέννητος, in the latter he may be
so called. Both uses, he says, are found in the fathers. Of the latter he quotes the passage
in Ignatius as an example; of the former he says, that some writers subsequent to Ignatius
declare ἕν τὸ ἀγέννητον ὁ πατὴρ, καὶ εἶς ὁ ἐξ αὐτου υἱὸς γνήσιος, γέννημα αληθίνον κ.τ.λ.
[He may have been thinking of Clem. Alex. Strom. vi. 7, which I shall quote below.] He
maintains that both are orthodox, as having in view two different senses of the word
ἀγέννητον , and the same, he argues, is the case with the councils which seem to take opposite
sides with regard to homousios. It is clear from this passage, as Zahn truly says, that Athanasius
is dealing with one and the same word throughout; and, if so, it follows that this
word must be ἀγέννητον, since ἀγένητον would be intolerable in some places. I may add
by way of caution that in two other passages, de Decret. Syn. Nic. 28 (1, p. 184), Orat. c.
Arian. i. 30 (1, p. 343), St. Athanasius gives the various senses of ἀγένητον (for this is plain
from the context), and that these passages ought not to be treated as parallels to the present
passage which is concerned with the senses of ἀγέννητον . Much confusion is thus created,
e.g. in Newman’s notes on the several passages in the Oxford translation of Athanasius (pp.
51 sq., 224 sq.), where the three passages are treated as parallel, and no attempt is made to
discriminate the readings in the several places, but “ingenerate” is given as the rendering of
both alike. If then Athanasius who read γεννητὸς καὶ ἀγέννητος in Ignatius, there is absolutely
no authority for the spelling with one ν. The earlier editors (Voss, Ussher, Cotelier,
etc.), printed it as they found it in the ms.; but Smith substituted the forms with the single
ν, and he has been followed more recently by Hefele, Dressel, and some other. In the Cas-
anatensian copy of the ms., a marginal note is added, ἀναγνωστέον ἀγένητος τοῦτ᾽ ἔστι μὴ
ποιηθείς. Waterland (Works, III., p. 240 sq., Oxf. 1823) tries ineffectually to show that the
form with the double ν was invented by the fathers at a later date to express their theological
conception. He even “doubts whether there was any such word as ἀγέννητος so early as
the time of Ignatius.” In this he is certainly wrong.</p>
<p>The mss. of early Christian writers exhibit much confusion between these words spelled
with the double and the single ν. See e.g. Justin Dial. 2, with Otto’s note; Athenag. Suppl. 4
with Otto’s note; Theophil, ad Autol. ii. 3, 4; Iren. iv. 38, 1, 3; Orig. c. Cels. vi. 66; Method.
de Lib. Arbitr., p. 57; Jahn (see Jahn’s note 11, p. 122); Maximus in Euseb. Præp. Ev. vii. 22;
Hippol. Hær. v. 16 (from Sibylline Oracles); Clem. Alex. Strom. v. 14; and very frequently
in later writers. Yet notwithstanding the confusion into which later transcribers have thus

<pb n="48"/>
thrown the subject, it is still possible to ascertain the main facts respecting the usage of the
two forms. The distinction between the two terms, as indicated by their origin, is that
ἀγένητος denies the creation, and ἀγέννητος the generation or parentage. Both are used at
a very early date; e.g. ἀγένητος by Parmenides in Clem. Alex. Strom. v. 14, and by Agothon
in Arist. Eth. Nic. vii. 2 (comp. also Orac. Sibyll. prooem. 7, 17); and ἀγέννητος in Soph.
Trach. 61 (where it is equivalent to δυσγενῶν. Here the distinction of meaning is strictly
preserved, and so probably it always is in Classical writers; for in Soph. Trach. 743 we should
after Porson and Hermann read ἀγένητον with Suidas. In Christian writers also there is
no reason to suppose that the distinction was ever lost, though in certain connexions the
words might be used convertibly. Whenever, as here in Ignatius, we have the double ν
where we should expect the single, we must ascribe the fact to the indistinctness or incorrectness
of the writer’s theological conceptions, not to any obliteration of the meaning of
the terms themselves. To this early father for instance the eternal γέννησις of the Son was
not a distinct theological idea, though substantially he held the same views as the Nicene
fathers respecting the Person of Christ. The following passages from early Christian writers
will serve at once to show how far the distinction was appreciated, and to what extent the
Nicene conception prevailed in ante-Nicene Christianity; Justin Apol. ii. 6, comp. ib. § 13;
Athenag. Suppl. 10 (comp. ib. 4); Theoph. ad. Aut. ii. 3; Tatian Orat. 5; Rhodon in Euseb.
H. E. v. 13; Clem. Alex. Strom. vi. 7; Orig. c. Cels. vi. 17, ib. vi. 52; Concil. Antioch (a.d. 269)
in Routh Rel. Sacr. III., p. 290; Method. de Creat. 5. In no early Christian writing, however,
is the distinction more obvious than in the Clementine Homilies, x. 10 (where the distinction
is employed to support the writer’s heretical theology): see also viii. 16, and comp. xix. 3,
4, 9, 12. The following are instructive passages as regards the use of these words where the
opinions of other heretical writers are given; Saturninus, Iren. i. 24, 1; Hippol. Hær. vii. 28;
Simon Magus, Hippol. Hær. vi. 17, 18; the Valentinians, Hippol. Hær. vi. 29, 30; the
Ptolemæus in particular, Ptol. Ep. ad. Flor. 4 (in Stieren’s Irenæus, p. 935); Basilides, Hippol.
Hær. vii. 22; Carpocrates, Hippol. Hær. vii. 32.</p>
<p>From the above passages it will appear that Ante-Nicene writers were not indifferent
to the distinction of meaning between the two words; and when once the orthodox Christology
was formulated in the Nicene Creed in the words γεννηθέντα οὐ ποιηθέντα, it became
henceforth impossible to overlook the difference. The Son was thus declared to be γεννητός
but not γενητός. I am therefore unable to agree with Zahn (Marcellus, pp. 40, 104, 223, Ign.
von Ant. p. 565), that at the time of the Arian controversy the disputants were not alive to
the difference of meaning. See for example Epiphanius, Hær. lxiv. 8. But it had no especial
interest for them. While the orthodox party clung to the homousios as enshrining the doctrine
for which they fought, they had no liking for the terms ἀγέννητος and γεννητός as applied
to the Father and the Son respectively, though unable to deny their propriety, because they
were affected by the Arians and applied in their own way. To the orthodox mind the Arian

<pb n="49"/>
formula οὐκ ἦν πρὶν γεννηθήναι or some Semiarian formula hardly less dangerous, seemed
always to be lurking under the expression Θεὸς γεννητός as applied to the Son. Hence the
language of Epiphanius Hær. lxxiii. 19: “As you refuse to accept our homousios because
though used by the fathers, it does not occur in the Scriptures, so will we decline on the
same grounds to accept your ἀγέννητος .” Similarly Basil c. Eunom. i., iv., and especially
ib. further on, in which last passage he argues at great length against the position of the
heretics, εἰ ἀγέννητος, φασὶν, ὁ πατήρ, γεννητὸς δὲ ὁ υἱός, οὐ τῆς αὐτῆς οὐσίας. See also
the arguments against the Anomoeans in [Athan.] Dial. de Trin. ii. passim. This fully explains
the reluctance of the orthodox party to handle terms which their adversaries used to endanger
the homousios. But, when the stress of the Arian controversy was removed, it became convenient
to express the Catholic doctrine by saying that the Son in his divine nature was
γέννητος but not γένητος. And this distinction is staunchly maintained in later orthodox
writers, e.g. John of Damascus, already quoted in the beginning of this Excursus.</p>

<p>The feeling that one devoted to the sacred ministry should be unmutilated was strong
in the Ancient Church.…This canon of Nice, and those in the Apostolic Canons and a later
one in the Second Council of Arles (canon vii.) were aimed against that perverted notion
of piety, originating in the misinterpretation of our Lord’s saying (Matt. xix. 12) by which
Origen, among others, was misled, and their observance was so carefully enforced in later
times that not more than one or two instances of the practice which they condemn are noticed
by the historian. The case was different if a man was born an eunuch or had suffered mutil-

is mentioned by Eusebius (H. E. vii., c. 32); of the latter, Tigris, presbyter of Constantinople,
is referred to both by Socrates (H. E. vi. 15) and Sozomen (H. E. vi. 24) as the victim of a
barbarian master.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>We know, by the first apology of St. Justin (Apol. c. 29) that a century before Origen, a
young man had desired to be mutilated by physicians, for the purpose of completely refuting
the charge of vice which the heathen brought against the worship of Christians. St. Justin
neither praises nor blames this young man: he only relates that he could not obtain the
permission of the civil authorities for his project, that he renounced his intention, but nevertheless
remained virgo all his life. It is very probable that the Council of Nice was induced
by some fresh similar cases to renew the old injunctions; it was perhaps the Arian bishop,
Leontius, who was the principal cause of it.58</p>
<p>Lambert.</p>
<p>Constantine forbade by a law the practice condemned in this canon. “If anyone shall
anywhere in the Roman Empire after this decree make eunuchs, he shall be punished with

fact, his goods shall be confiscated.” (Const. M. Opera. Migne Patrol. vol. viii., 396.)</p>

<p>The Nicene fathers in this canon make no new enactment but only confirm by the authority
of an Ecumenical synod the Apostolic Canons, and this is evident from the wording
of this canon. For there can be no doubt that they had in mind some earlier canon when
they said, “such men the canon admits to the clergy.” Not, ὁυτος ὁ κανὼν, but ὁ κανὼν,
as if they had said “the formerly set forth and well-known canon” admits such to the clergy.
But no other canon then existed in which this provision occurred except apostolical canon

<head>Excursus on the Use of the Word “Canon.”</head>
<p>(Bright: Notes on the Canons, pp. 2 and 3.)</p>
<p>Κανών, as an ecclesiastical term, has a very interesting history. See Westcott’s account
of it, On the New Testament Canon, p. 498 ff. The original sense, “a straight rod” or “line,”
determines all its religious applications, which begin with St. Paul’s use of it for a prescribed
sphere of apostolic work (2 Cor. x. 13, 15), or a regulative principle of Christian life (Gal.
vi. 16). It represents the element of definiteness in Christianity and in the order of the
Christian Church. Clement of Rome uses it for the measure of Christian attainment (Ep.
Cor. 7). Irenæus calls the baptismal creed “the canon of truth” (i. 9, 4): Polycrates (Euseb.
v. 24) and probably Hippolytus (ib. v. 28) calls it “the canon of faith;” the Council of Antioch
in a.d. 269, referring to the same standard of orthodox belief, speaks with significant absoluteness
of “the canon” (ib. vii. 30). Eusebius himself mentions “the canon of truth” in iv.
23, and “the canon of the preaching” in iii. 32; and so Basil speaks of “the transmitted canon
of true religion” (Epist. 204–6). Such language, like Tertullian’s “regula fidei,” amounted
to saying, “We Christians know what we believe: it is not a vague ‘idea’ without substance
or outline: it can be put into form, and by it we ‘test the spirits whether they be of God.’”
Thus it was natural for Socrates to call the Nicene Creed itself a “canon,” ii. 27. Clement of
Alexandria uses the phrase “canon of truth” for a standard of mystic interpretation, but
proceeds to call the harmony between the two Testaments “a canon for the Church,” Strom.
vi. 15, 124, 125. Eusebius speaks of “the ecclesiastical canon” which recognized no other
Gospels than the four (vi. 25). The use of the term and its cognates in reference to the
Scriptures is explained by Westcott in a passive sense so that “canonized” books, as Athanasius
calls them (Fest. Ep. 39), are books expressly recognized by the Church as portions of
Holy Scripture. Again, as to matters of observance, Clement of Alexandria wrote a book
against Judaizers, called “The Churches Canon” (Euseb. vi. 13); and Cornelius of Rome, in
his letter to Fabius, speaks of the “canon” as to what we call confirmation (Euseb. vi. 43),
and Dionysius of the “canon” as to reception of converts from heresy (ib. vii. 7). The Nicene
Council in this canon refers to a standing “canon” of discipline (comp. Nic. 2, 5, 6, 9, 10,
15, 16, 18), but it does not apply the term to its own enactments, which are so described in
the second canon of Constantinople (see below), and of which Socrates says “that it passed
what are usually called ‘canons’” (i. 13); as Julius of Rome calls a decree of this Council a
“canon” (Athan. Apol. c. Ari. 25); so Athanasius applies the term generally to Church laws
(Encycl. 2; cp. Apol. c. Ari. 69). The use of κανών for the clerical body (Nic. 16, 17, 19;
Chalc. 2) is explained by Westcott with reference to the rule of clerical life, but Bingham
traces it to the roll or official list on which the names of clerics were enrolled (i. 5, 10); and
this appears to be the more natural derivation, see “the holy canon” in the first canon of the
Council of Antioch, and compare Socrates (i. 17), “the Virgins enumerated ἐν τῷ τῶν

<pb n="53"/>
ἐκκλησιῶν κανόνι,” and (ib. v. 19) on the addition of a penitentiary “to the canon of the
church;” see also George of Laodicea in Sozomon, iv. 13. Hence any cleric might be called
κανονικός , see Cyril of Jerusalem, Procatech. 4; so we read of “canonical singers.” Laodicea,
canon xv. The same notion of definiteness appears in the ritual use of the word for a series
of nine “odes” in the Eastern Church service (Neale, Introd. East. Ch. ii. 832), for the central
and unvarying element in the Liturgy, beginning after the Tersanctus (Hammond, Liturgies
East and West, p. 377); or for any Church office (Ducange in v.); also in its application to a
table for the calculation of Easter (Euseb. vi. 29; vii. 32); to a scheme for exhibiting the
common and peculiar parts of the several Gospels (as the “Eusebian canons”) and to a prescribed
or ordinary payment to a church, a use which grew out of one found in Athanasius’
Apol. c. Ari. 60.</p>
<p>In more recent times a tendency has appeared to restrict the term Canon to matters of
discipline, but the Council of Treat continued the ancient use of the word, calling its doctrinal
and disciplinary determinations alike “Canons.”</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>Forasmuch as, either from necessity, or through the urgency of individuals, many things
have been done contrary to the Ecclesiastical canon, so that men just converted from heathenism
to the faith, and who have been instructed but a little while, are straightway brought
to the spiritual laver, and as soon as they have been baptized, are advanced to the episcopate
or the presbyterate, it has seemed right to us that for the time to come no such thing shall
be done. For to the catechumen himself there is need of time and of a longer trial after
baptism. For the apostolical saying is clear, “Not a novice; lest, being lifted up with pride,
he fall into condemnation and the snare of the devil.” But if, as time goes on, any sensual
sin should be found out about the person, and he should be convicted by two or three witnesses,
let him cease from the clerical office. And whoso shall transgress these [enactments]
will imperil his own clerical position, as a person who presumes to disobey the great Synod.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</p>
<p>Those who have come from the heathen shall not be immediately advanced to the presbyterate.
For without a probation of some time a neophyte is of no advantage (κακός). But if
after ordination it be found out that he had sinned previously, let him then be expelled from
the clergy. </p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>It may be seen by the very text of this canon, that it was already forbidden to baptize,
and to raise to the episcopate or to the priesthood anyone who had only been a catechumen
for a short time: this injunction is in fact contained in the eightieth (seventy-ninth)
apostolical canon; and according to that, it would be older than the Council of Nicæa. There
have been, nevertheless, certain cases in which, for urgent reasons, an exception has been
made to the rule of the Council of Nicæa—for instance, that of S. Ambrose. The canon of
Nicæa does not seem to allow such an exception, but it might be justified by the apostolical
canon, which says, at the close: “It is not right that any one who has not yet been proved
should be a teacher of others, unless by a peculiar divine grace.” The expression of the
canon of Nicæa, ψυχικὸν τι ἁμάρτημα, is not easy to explain: some render it by the Latin
words animale peccatam, believing that the Council has here especially in view sins of the
flesh; but as Zonaras has said, all sins are ψυχικὰ ἁμαρτήματα. We must then understand
the passage in question to refer to a capital and very serious offence, as the penalty of deposition
annexed to it points out.</p>

<pb n="55"/>
<p>These words have also given offence, εἰ δὲ προϊόντος τοῦ χρόνον; that is to say, “It is
necessary henceforward,” etc., understanding that it is only those who have been too quickly
ordained who are threatened with deposition in case they are guilty of crime; but the canon
is framed, and ought to be understood, in a general manner: it applies to all other clergymen,
but it appears also to point out that greater severity should be shown toward those who have
been too quickly ordained.</p>
<p>Others have explained the passage in this manner: “If it shall become known that any
one who has been too quickly ordained was guilty before his baptism of any serious offence,
he ought to be deposed.” This is the interpretation given by Gratian, but it must be confessed
that such a translation does violence to the text. This is, I believe, the general sense of the
canon, and of this passage in particular: “Henceforward no one shall be baptized or ordained
quickly. As to those already in orders (without any distinction between those who have
been ordained in due course and those who have been ordained too quickly), the rule is that
they shall be deposed if they commit a serious offence. Those who are guilty of disobedience
to this great Synod, either by allowing themselves to be ordained or even by ordaining others
prematurely, are threatened with deposition ipso facto, and for this fault alone.” We consider,
in short, that the last words of the canon may be understood as well of the ordained as of
the ordainer.</p>

<p>The great Synod has stringently forbidden any bishop, presbyter, deacon, or any one

sister, or aunt, or such persons only as are beyond all suspicion.</p>

<p>Who these mulieres subintroductæ were does not sufficiently appear…but they were
neither wives nor concubines, but women of some third kind, which the clergy kept with
them, not for the sake of offspring or lust, but from the desire, or certainly under the pretence,
of piety.</p>
<p>Johnson.</p>
<p>For want of a proper English word to render it by, I translate “to retain any woman in
their houses under pretence of her being a disciple to them.”</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Translates: And his sisters and aunts cannot remain unless they be free from all suspicion.</p>
<p>Fuchs in his Bibliothek der kirchenver sammlungen confesses that this canon shews that
the practice of clerical celibacy had already spread widely. In connexion with this whole
subject of the subintroductæ the text of St. Paul should be carefully considered. 1 Cor. ix.
5.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>It is very certain that the canon of Nice forbids such spiritual unions, but the context
shows moreover that the Fathers had not these particular cases in view alone; and the expression
συνείσακτος should be understood of every woman who is introduced (συνείσακτος)
into the house of a clergyman for the purpose of living there. If by the word συνείσακτος
was only intended the wife in this spiritual marriage, the Council would not have said, any
συνείσακτος, except his mother, etc.; for neither his mother nor his sister could have formed

<pb n="57"/>
this spiritual union with the cleric. The injunction, then, does net merely forbid the
συνείσακτος in the specific sense, but orders that “no woman must live in the house of a
cleric, unless she be his mother,” etc.</p>

<head>Canon IV.</head>
<p>It is by all means proper that a bishop should be appointed by all the bishops in the
province; but should this be difficult, either on account of urgent necessity or because of
distance, three at least should meet together, and the suffrages of the absent [bishops] also
being given and communicated in writing, then the ordination should take place. But in
every province the ratification of what is done should be left to the Metropolitan.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</p>
<p>A bishop is to be chosen by all the bishops of the province, or at least by three, the rest
giving by letter their assent; but this choice must be confirmed by the Metropolitan.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>The present Canon might seem to be opposed to the first canon of the Holy Apostles,
for the latter enjoins that a bishop ordained by two or three bishops, but this by three, the
absent also agreeing and testifying their assent by writing. But they are not contradictory;
for the Apostolical canon by ordination (χειροτονίαν) means consecration and imposition
of hands, but the present canon by constitution (κατάστασιν) and ordination means the
election, and enjoins that the election of a bishop do not take place unless three assemble,
having the consent also of the absent by letter, or a declaration that they also will acquiesce
in the election (or vote, ψήφῳ) made by the three who have assembled. But after the election
it gives the ratification or completion of the matter—the imposition of hands and consecration—
to the metropolitan of the province, so that the election is to be ratified by him. He
does so when with two or three bishops, according to the apostolical canon, he consecrates
with imposition of hands the one of the elected persons whom he himself selects.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>Also understands καθίστασθαι to mean election by vote.
Bright.</p>
<p>The Greek canonists are certainly in error when they interpret χειροτονία of election.
The canon is akin to the 1st Apostolic canon which, as the canonists admit, must refer to
the consecration of a new bishop, and it was cited in that sense at the Council of
Chalcedon—Session xiii. (Mansi., vii. 307). We must follow Rufinus and the old Latin
translators, who speak of “ordinari,” “ordinatio” and “manus impositionem.”</p>

<pb n="59"/>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The Council of Nice thought it necessary to define by precise rules the duties of the
bishops who took part in these episcopal elections. It decided (a) that a single bishop of the
province was not sufficient for the appointment of another; (b) three at least should meet,
and (c) they were not to proceed to election without the written permission of the absent
bishops; it was necessary (d) to obtain afterward the approval of the metropolitan. The
Council thus confirms the ordinary metropolitan division in its two most important points,
namely, the nomination and ordination of bishops, and the superior position of the metropolitan.
The third point connected with this division—namely, the provincial synod—will
be considered under the next canon.</p>
<p>Meletius was probably the occasion of this canon. It may be remembered that he had
nominated bishops without the concurrence of the other bishops of the province, and
without the approval of the metropolitan of Alexandria, and had thus occasioned a schism.
This canon was intended to prevent the recurrence of such abuses. The question has been
raised as to whether the fourth canon speaks only of the choice of the bishop, or whether it
also treats of the consecration of the newly elected. We think, with Van Espen, that it treats
equally of both,—as well of the part which the bishops of the province should take in an
episcopal election, as of the consecration which completes it.</p>
<p>This canon has been interpreted in two ways. The Greeks had learnt by bitter experience
to distrust the interference of princes and earthly potentates in episcopal elections. Accordingly,
they tried to prove that this canon of Nice took away from the people the right of
voting at the nomination of a bishop, and confined the nomination exclusively to the bishops
of the province.</p>
<p>The Greek Commentators, Balsamon and others, therefore, only followed the example
of the Seventh and [so-called] Eighth OEcumenical Councils in affirming that this fourth
canon of Nice takes away from the people the right previously possessed of voting in the
choice of bishops and makes the election depend entirely on the decision of the bishops of
the province.</p>
<p>The Latin Church acted otherwise. It is true that with it also the people have been removed
from episcopal elections, but this did not happen till later, about the eleventh century;
and it was not the people only who were removed, but the bishops of the province as well,
and the election was conducted entirely by the clergy of the Cathedral Church. The Latins
then interpreted the canon of Nice as though it said nothing of the rights of the bishops of
the province in the election of their future colleague (and it does not speak of it in a very
explicit manner), and as though it determined these two points only; (a) that for the ordination
of a bishop three bishops at least are necessary; (b) that the right of confirmation rests
with the metropolitan.</p>

<pb n="60"/>
<p>The whole subject of episcopal elections is treated fully by Van Espen and by Thomassin,
in Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l’ Église, P. II. l. 2.

<head>Canon V.</head>
<p>Concerning those, whether of the clergy or of the laity, who have been excommunicated
in the several provinces, let the provision of the canon be observed by the bishops which
provides that persons cast out by some be not readmitted by others. Nevertheless, inquiry
should be made whether they have been excommunicated through captiousness, or contentiousness,
or any such like ungracious disposition in the bishop. And, that this matter may
have due investigation, it is decreed that in every province synods shall be held twice a year,
in order that when all the bishops of the province are assembled together, such questions
may by them be thoroughly examined, that so those who have confessedly offended against
their bishop, may be seen by all to be for just cause excommunicated, until it shall seem fit
to a general meeting of the bishops to pronounce a milder sentence upon them. And let
these synods be held, the one before Lent, (that the pure Gift may be offered to God after
all bitterness has been put away), and let the second be held about autumn.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</p>
<p>Such as have been excommunicated by certain bishops shall not be restored by others,
unless the excommunication was the result of pusillanimity, or strife, or some other similar
cause. And that this may be duly attended to, there shall be in each year two synods in every
province—the one before Lent, the other toward autumn.
There has always been found the greatest difficulty in securing the regular meetings of
provincial and diocesan synods, and despite the very explicit canonical legislation upon the
subject, and the severe penalties attached to those not answering the summons, in large
parts of the Church for centuries these councils have been of the rarest occurrence. Zonaras
complains that in his time “these synods were everywhere treated with great contempt,”
and that they had actually ceased to be held.</p>
<p>Possibly the opinion of St. Gregory Nazianzen had grown common, for it will be remembered
that in refusing to go to the latter sessions of the Second Ecumenical he wrote,
“I am resolved to avoid every meeting of bishops, for I have never seen any synod end well,
nor assuage rather than aggravate disorders.”59</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Gelasius has given in his history of the Council of Nice, the text of the canons passed
by the Council; and it must be noticed that there is here a slight difference between his text
<note type="footnote">59 Greg. Naz. Ep. ad Procop., Migne, Pat. Græc., No. cxxx.</note>

<pb n="62"/>
and ours. Our reading is as follows: “The excommunication continues to be in force until
it seem good to the assembly of bishops (τῳ κοινῷ) to soften it.” Gelasius, on the other
hand, writes: μέχρις ἄν τῷ κοινῷ ἢ τῷ ἐπισκόπῳ, κ.τ.λ., that is to say, “until it seem good
to the assembly of bishops, or to the bishop (who has passed the sentence),” etc.…Dionysius
the Less has also followed this variation, as his translation of the canon shows. It does not
change the essential meaning of the passage; for it may be well understood that the bishop
who has passed the sentence of excommunication has also the right to mitigate it. But the
variation adopted by the Prisca alters, on the contrary, the whole sense of the canon: the
Prisca has not τῳ κοινῳ, but only ἐπισκόπῳ : it is in this erroneous form that the canon
has passed into the Corpus jurisc an.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Word Προσφέρειν .</head>
<p>(Dr. Adolph Harnack: Hist. of Dogma [Eng. Tr.] Vol. I. p. 209.)</p>
<p>The idea of the whole transaction of the Supper as a sacrifice, is plainly found in the
Didache, (c. 14), in Ignatius, and above all, in Justin (I. 65f.) But even Clement of Rome
presupposes it, when (in cc. 40–44) he draws a parallel between bishops and deacons and
the Priests and Levites of the Old Testament, describing as the chief function of the former
(44.4) προσφέρειν τὰ δῶρα. This is not the place to enquire whether the first celebration
had, in the mind of its founder, the character of a sacrificial meal; but, certainly, the idea,
as it was already developed at the time of Justin, had been created by the churches. Various
reasons tended towards seeing in the Supper a sacrifice. In the first place, Malachi i. 11,
demanded a solemn Christian sacrifice: see my notes on Didache, 14.3. In the second place,
all prayers were regarded as a sacrifice, and therefore the solemn prayers at the Supper must
be specially considered as such. In the third place, the words of institution τοῦτο ποιεῖτε,
contained a command with regard to a definite religious action. Such an action, however,
could only be represented as a sacrifice, and this the more, that the Gentile Christians might
suppose that they had to understand ποιεῖν in the sense of θύειν. In the fourth place, payments
in kind were necessary for the “agapæ” connected with the Supper, out of which were
taken the bread and wine for the Holy celebration; in what other aspect could these offerings
in the worship be regarded than as προσφοραί for the purpose of a sacrifice? Yet the spiritual
idea so prevailed that only the prayers were regarded as the θυσία proper, even in the
case of Justin (Dial. 117). The elements are only δῶρα, προσφοραί, which obtain their value
from the prayers, in which thanks are given for the gifts of creation and redemption, as well
as for the holy meal, and entreaty is made for the introduction of the community into the
Kingdom of God (see Didache, 9. 10). Therefore, even the sacred meal itself is called
εὐχαριστία (Justin, Apol. I. 66: ἡ τροφὴ αὕτη καλεῖται παρ᾽ ἡμῖν εὐχαριστία . Didache, 9.
1: Ignat.), because it is τραφὴ εὐχαριστηθεῖσα. It is a mistake to suppose that Justin already
understood the body of Christ to be the object of ποιεῖν,60 and therefore thought of a sacrifice
of this body (I. 66). The real sacrificial act in the Supper consists rather, according to Justin,
only in the εὐχαριστίαν ποιεῖν whereby the κοινὸς ἄρτος becomes the ἄρτος τῆς εὐχαριστίας
<note type="footnote">60 Harnack seems to know only the printed (and almost certainly incorrect) reading of the modern texts of
the I. Apology (Chapter LXVI) where τοῦτο ἐστι has taken the place of τούτεστι. The passage did read, τοῦτο
ποιεῖτε, εἰς τὴν ἀνάμνησίν μου, τούτεστι τὸ σῶμά μου; in which it is evident that the words “my body” are in
apposition with τοῦτο and the object of ποιεῖτε, which has its sacrificial sense “to offer,” as in the Dialogue with
Trypho, ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν παρέδωκε ποιεῖν (chapter xlj).</note>

<pb n="64"/>
.61 The sacrifice of the Supper in its essence, apart from the offering of alms, which in the
practice of the Church was closely united with it, is nothing but a sacrifice of prayer: the
sacrificial act of the Christian here also is nothing else than an act of prayer (See Apol. I. 14,
65–67; Dial. 28, 29, 41, 70, 116–118).</p>
<p>Harnack (lib. cit. Vol. II. chapter III. p. 136) says that “Cyprian was the first to associate
the specific offering, i.e. the Lord’s Supper with the specific priesthood. Secondly, he was
the first to designate the passio Domini, nay, the sanguis Christi and the dominica hostia as
the object of the eucharistic offering.” In a foot-note (on the same page) he explains that
“Sacrificare, Sacrificium celebrare in all passages where they are unaccompanied by any
qualifying words, mean to celebrate the Lord’s Supper.” But Harnack is confronted by the
very evident objection that if this was an invention of St. Cyprian’s, it is most extraordinary
that it raised no protest, and he very frankly confesses (note 2, on same page) that “the
transference of the sacrificial idea to the consecrated elements which in all probability
Cyprian already found in existence, etc.” Harnack further on (in the same note on p. 137)
notes that he has pointed out in his notes on the Didache that in the “Apostolic Church
Order” occurs the expression ἥ προσφορὰ τοῦ σώματος καὶ τοῦ αἵματος.</p>
<note type="footnote">61 Harnack evidently does not fully appreciate the Catholic doctrine of the Sacrifice in the Holy Eucharist.
No catholic theologian teaches that the essence of that sacrifice is to offer up the already present Body of Christ,
but that the essence of the Sacrifice is the act of consecration; the “making the Eucharistic Sacrifice,” as he accurately
says, “whereby the common bread becomes the Bread of the Eucharist.” Harnack says truly that “the sacrificial
act of the Christian here also is nothing else than an act of prayer,” but he does not seem to know that
this is the Catholic doctrine to-day, nor to appreciate at its Catholic value the “Prayer of Consecration.” The
act of consecration is the essence of the Christian Sacrifice according to the teaching of all Catholics.</note>

<p>Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the Bishop of Alexandria
have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also.
Likewise in Antioch and the other provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges. And
this is to be universally understood, that if any one be made bishop without the consent of
the Metropolitan, the great Synod has declared that such a man ought not to be a bishop.
If, however, two or three bishops shall from natural love of contradiction, oppose the common
suffrage of the rest, it being reasonable and in accordance with the ecclesiastical law,
then let the choice of the majority prevail.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Alexandria shall have jurisdiction over Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis. As
also the Roman bishop over those subject to Rome. So, too, the Bishop of Antioch and the rest
over those who are under them. If any be a bishop contrary to the judgment of the Metropolitan,
let him be no bishop. Provided it be in accordance with the canons by the suffrage of the
majority, if three object, their objection shall be of no force.</p>
<p>Many, probably most, commentators have considered this the most important and most
interesting of all the Nicene canons, and a whole library of works has been written upon it,
some of the works asserting and some denying what are commonly called the Papal claims.
If any one wishes to see a list of the most famous of these works he will find it in Phillips’s
Kirchenrecht (Bd. ii. S. 35). I shall reserve what I have to say upon this subject to the notes
on a canon which seems really to deal with it, confining myself here to an elucidation of the
words found in the canon before us.</p>
<p>Hammond, W. A.</p>
<p>The object and intention of this canon seems clearly to have been, not to introduce any
new powers or regulations into the Church, but to confirm and establish ancient customs
already existing. This, indeed, is evident from the very first words of it: “Let the ancient
customs be maintained.” It appears to have been made with particular reference to the case
of the Church of Alexandria, which had been troubled by the irregular proceedings of Miletius,
and to confirm the ancient privileges of that see which he had invaded. The latter part
of it, however, applies to all Metropolitans, and confirms all their ancient privileges.</p>
<p>Ffoulkes.</p>
<p>(Dict. Christ. Antiq. voce Council of Nicæa).</p>

<pb n="66"/>
<p>The first half of the canon enacts merely that what had long been customary with respect
to such persons in every province should become law, beginning with the province where
this principle had been infringed; while the second half declares what was in future to be
received as law on two points which custom had not as yet expressly ruled.…Nobody disputes
the meaning of this last half; nor, in fact, would the meaning of the first half have been
questioned, had it not included Rome.…Nobody can maintain that the bishops of Antioch
and Alexandria were called patriarchs then, or that the jurisdiction they had then was coextensive
with what they had afterward, when they were so called.…It is on this clause
[“since the like is customary for the Bishops of Rome also”] standing parenthetically between
what is decreed for the particular cases of Egypt and Antioch, and in consequence of the
interpretation given to it by Rufinus, more particularly, that so much strife has been raised.
Rufinus may rank low as a translator, yet, being a native of Aquileia, he cannot have been
ignorant of Roman ways, nor, on the other hand, had he greatly misrepresented them, would
his version have waited till the seventeenth century to be impeached.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The sense of the first words of the canon is as follows: “This ancient right is assigned
to the Bishop of Alexandria which places under his jurisdiction the whole diocese of Egypt.”
It is without any reason, then, that the French Protestant Salmasius (Saumaise), the
Anglican Beveridge, and the Gallican Launoy, try to show that the Council of Nice granted
to the Bishop of Alexandria only the rights of ordinary metropolitans.</p>
<p>Bishop Stillingfleet.</p>
<p>I do confess there was something peculiar in the case of the Bishop of Alexandria, for
all the provinces of Egypt were under his immediate care, which was Patriarchal as to extent,
but Metropolical in the administration.</p>
<p>Justellus.</p>
<p>This authority (ἐξουσία) is that of a Metropolitan which the Nicene Fathers decreed to
be his due over the three provinces named in this canon, Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, which
made up the whole diocese of Egypt, as well in matters civil as ecclesiastical.</p>
<p>On this important question Hefele refers to the dissertation of Dupin, in his work De
Antiqua Ecclesiæ Disciplina. Hefele says: “It seems to me beyond a doubt that in this canon
there is a question about that which was afterward called the patriarchate of the Bishop of
Alexandria; that is to say that he had a certain recognized ecclesiastical authority, not only
over several civil provinces, but also over several ecclesiastical provinces (which had their
own metropolitans);” and further on (p. 392) he adds: “It is incontestable that the civil

<pb n="67"/>
provinces of Egypt, Libya, Pentapolis and Thebaïs, which were all in subjection to the
Bishop of Alexandria, were also ecclesiastical provinces with their own metropolitans; and
consequently it is not the ordinary rights of metropolitans that the Sixth Canon of Nice
confers on the Bishop of Alexandria, but the rights of a superior Metropolitan, that is, of a
Patriarch.”</p>
<p>There only remains to see what were the bounds of the jurisdiction of the Bishop of
Antioch. The civil diocese of Oriens is shown by the Second Canon of Constantinople to
be conterminous with what was afterward called the Patriarchate of Antioch. The see of
Antioch had, as we know, several metropolitans subject to it, among them Cæsarea, under
whose jurisdiction was Palestine. Justellus, however, is of opinion that Pope Innocent I.
was in error when he asserted that all the Metropolitans of Oriens were to be ordained by
him by any peculiar authority, and goes so far as to stigmatize his words as “contrary to the
mind of the Nicene Synod.”62</p>

<head>Excursus on the Extent of the Jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome Over
the Suburbican Churches.</head>
<p>Although, as Hefele well says, “It is evident that the Council has not in view here the
primacy of the Bishop of Rome over the whole Church, but simply his power as a patriarch,”
yet it may not be unimportant to consider what his patriarchal limits may have been.</p>
<p>(Hefele, Hist. Councils, Vol. I., p. 397.)</p>
<p>The translation of this <del>VI.</del> canon by Rufinus has been especially an apple of discord.
Et ut apud Alexandriam et in urbe Roma vetusta consuetudo servetur, ut vel ille Egypti vel
hic suburbicariarum ecclesiarum sollicitudinem gerat. In the seventeenth century this sentence
of Rufinus gave rise to a very lively discussion between the celebrated jurist, Jacob
Gothfried (Gothofredus), and his friend, Salmasius, on one side, and the Jesuit, Sirmond,
on the other. The great prefecture of Italy, which contained about a third of the whole Roman
Empire, was divided into four vicariates, among which the vicariate of Rome was the first.
At its head were two officers, the proefectus urbi and the vicarius urbis. The proefectus urbi
exercised authority over the city of Rome, and further in a suburban circle as far as the
hundredth milestone. The boundary of the vicarius urbis comprised ten provinces—Campania,
Tuscia with Ombria, Picenum, Valeria, Samnium, Apulia with Calabria, Lucania and
that of the Brutii, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Gothfried and Salmasius maintained, that
by the regiones suburbicariæ the little territory of the proefectus urbi must be understood;
while, according to Sirmond, these words designate the whole territory of the vicarius urbis.
In our time Dr. Maasen has proved in his book,63 already quoted several times, that Gothfried
and Salmasius were right in maintaining that, by the regiones suburbicariæ, the little territory
of the proefectus urbi must be alone understood.</p>
<p>Hefele thinks that Phillips “has proved” that the Bishop of Rome had patriarchal rights
over places outside the limits of the ten provinces of the vicarius urbis; but does not agree
with Phillips in thinking Rufinus in error. As a matter of fact the point is a difficult one,
and has little to do with the gist of the meaning of the canon. One thing is certain: the early
Latin version of the canons, called the Prisca, was not satisfied with the Greek wording and
made the Canon read thus: “It is of ancient custom that the bishop of the city of Rome
should have a primacy (principatum), so that he should govern with care the suburban
places, and all his own province.”64 Another interesting reading is that found in several
mss. which begins, “The Church of Rome hath always had a primacy (primatum),” and as
<note type="footnote">63 Friedrich Maasen: Der Primat des Bischofs von Rom. und die alten Patriarchalkirchen. Bonn, 1853. §
100–110. Maasen goes on to express the opinion that the patriarchal power of Rome was much larger.</note>
<note type="footnote">64 Vide Labbe’s Observation. Tom. II., col. 47.</note>

<pb n="69"/>
a matter of fact the early date of this addition is evinced by the fact that the canon was actually
quoted in this shape by Paschasinus at the Council of Chalcedon.</p>
<p>Hefele further on says, “The Greek commentators Zonaras and Balsamon (of the twelfth
century) say very explicitly, in their explanation of the Canons of Nice, that this sixth canon
confirms the rights of the Bishop of Rome as patriarch over the whole West,” and refers to
Beveridge’s Synodicon, Tom. I., pp. 66 and 67. After diligent search I can find nothing to
warrant the great amplitude of this statement. Balsamon’s interpretation is very vague, being
simply that the Bishop of Rome is over the Western Eparchies (τῶν ἑσπερίων ἐπάρχιων)
and Zonaras still more vaguely says that τῶν ἑσπερίων ἄρχειν ἔθος ἐκράτησε. That the
whole West was in a general way understood to be in the Roman Patriarchate I have no
doubt, that the Greek scholiasts just quoted deemed it to be so I think most probably the
case, but it does not seem to me that they have said so in the particular place cited. It seems
to me that all they meant to say was that the custom observed at Alexandria and Antioch
was no purely Eastern and local thing, for a similar state of affairs was found in the West.</p>

<head>Canon VII.</head>
<p>Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the Bishop of Ælia [i.e., Jerusalem]
should be honoured, let him, saving its due dignity to the Metropolis, have the next place
of honour.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</p>
<p>Let the Bishop of Ælia be honoured, the rights of the Metropolis being preserved intact.</p>
<p>There would seem to be a singular fitness in the Holy City Jerusalem holding a very
exalted position among the sees of Christendom, and it may appear astonishing that in the
earliest times it was only a suffragan see to the great Church of Cæsarea. It must be remembered,
however, that only about seventy years after our Lord’s death the city of Jerusalem
was entirely destroyed and ploughed as a field according to the prophet. As a holy city Jerusalem
was a thing of the past for long years, and it is only in the beginning of the second
century that we find a strong Christian Church growing up in the rapidly increasing city,
called no longer Jerusalem, but Ælia Capitolina. Possibly by the end of the second century
the idea of the holiness of the site began to lend dignity to the occupant of the see; at all
events Eusebius65 tells us that “at a synod held on the subject of the Easter controversy in
the time of Pope Victor, Theophilus of Cæsarea and Narcissus of Jerusalem were presidents.”</p>
<p>It was this feeling of reverence which induced the passing of this seventh canon. It is
very hard to determine just what was the “precedence” granted to the Bishop of Ælia, nor
is it clear which is the metropolis referred to in the last clause. Most writers, including
Hefele, Balsamon, Aristenus and Beveridge consider it to be Cæsarea; while Zonaras thinks
Jerusalem to be intended, a view recently adopted and defended by Fuchs;66 others again
suppose it is Antioch that is referred to.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Rise of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem.</head>
<p>The narrative of the successive steps by which the See of Jerusalem rose from being
nothing but Ælia, a Gentile city, into one of the five patriarchal sees is sad reading for a
Christian. It is but the record of ambition and, worse still, of knavery. No Christian can
for a moment grudge to the Holy City of the old dispensation the honour shewn it by the
Church, but he may well wish that the honour had been otherwise obtained. A careful study
of such records as we possess shews that until the fifth century the Metropolitan of Cæsarea
as often took precedence of the Bishop of Jerusalem as vice versa, and Beveridge has taken
great pains to shew that the learned De Marca is in error in supposing that the Council of
Nice assigned to Jerusalem a dignity superior to Cæsarea, and only inferior to Rome, Alexandria,
and Antioch. It is true that in the signatures the Bishop of Jerusalem does sign before
his metropolitan, but to this Beveridge justly replies that the same is the case with the occupants
of two other of his suffragan sees. Bishop Beveridge’s opinion is that the Council assigned
Jerusalem the second place in the province, such as London enjoys in the Province
of Canterbury. This, however, would seem to be as much too little as De Marca’s contention
grants too much. It is certain that almost immediately after the Council had adjourned, the
Bishop of Jerusalem, Maximus, convoked a synod of Palestine, without any reference to
Cæsarea, which consecrated bishops and acquitted St. Athanasius. It is true that he was
reprimanded for doing so,67 but yet it clearly shews how he intended to understand the action
of Nice. The matter was not decided for a century more, and then through the chicanery
of Juvenal the bishop of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>(Canon Venables, Dict. Christ. Biography.)</p>
<p>Juvenalis succeeded Praylius as bishop of Jerusalem somewhere about 420 a.d. The
exact year cannot be determined. The episcopate of Praylius, which commenced in 417
a.d., was but short, and we can hardly give it at most more than three years. The statement
of Cyril of Scythopolis, in his Life of St. Euthymius (c. 96), that Juvenal died “in the fortyfourth
year of his episcopate,” 458 a.d., is certainly incorrect, as it would make his episcopate
begin in 414 a.d., three years before that of his predecessor. Juvenal occupies a prominent
position during the Nestorian and Eutychian troubles towards the middle of the fifth century.
But the part played by him at the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, as well as at the disgraceful
λῃστρικὴ σύνοδος of 449, was more conspicuous than creditable, and there are few
of the actors in these turbulent and saddening scenes who leave a more unpleasing impression.
The ruling object of Juvenal’s episcopate, to which everything else was secondary, and
which guided all his conduct, was the elevation of the see of Jerusalem from the subordinate
<note type="footnote">67 Socrates: Hist. Eccl., ii. 24.</note>

<pb n="72"/>
position it held in accordance with the seventh of the canons of the council of Nicæa, as
suffragan to the metropolitan see of Cæsarea, to a primary place in the episcopate. Not
content with aspiring to metropolitan rank, Juvenal coveted patriarchal dignity, and, in
defiance of all canonical authority, he claimed jurisdiction over the great see of Antioch,
from which he sought to remove Arabia and the two Phoenicias to his own province. At
the council of Ephesus, in 431, he asserted for “the apostolic see of Jerusalem the same rank
and authority with the apostolic see of Rome” (Labbe, Concil. iii. 642). These falsehoods he
did not scruple to support with forged documents (“insolenter ausus per commentitia scripta
firmare,” Leo. Mag. Ep. 119 [92]), and other disgraceful artifices. Scarcely had Juvenal been
consecrated bishop of Jerusalem when he proceeded to assert his claims to the metropolitan
rank by his acts. In the letter of remonstrance against the proceedings of the council of
Ephesus, sent to Theodosius by the Oriental party, they complain that Juvenal, whose “ambitious
designs and juggling tricks” they are only too well acquainted with, had ordained in
provinces over which he had no jurisdiction (Labbe, Concil. iii. 728). This audacious attempt
to set at nought the Nicene decrees, and to falsify both history and tradition was regarded
with the utmost indignation by the leaders of the Christian church. Cyril of Alexandria
shuddered at the impious design (“merito perhorrescens,” Leo. u. s.), and wrote to Leo, then
archdeacon of Rome, informing him of what Juvenal was undertaking, and begging that his
unlawful attempts might have no sanction from the apostolic See (“ut nulla illicitis conatibus
præberetur assensio,” u. s.). Juvenal, however, was far too useful an ally in his campaign
against Nestorius for Cyril lightly to discard. When the council met at Ephesus Juvenal was
allowed, without the slightest remonstrance, to take precedence of his metropolitan of
Cæsarea, and to occupy the position of vice-president of the council, coming next after Cyril
himself (Labbe, Concil. iii. 445), and was regarded in all respects as the second prelate in the
assembly. The arrogant assertion of his supremacy over the bishop of Antioch, and his
claim to take rank next after Rome as an apostolical see, provoked no open remonstrance,
and his pretensions were at least tacitly allowed. At the next council, the disgraceful Latrocinium,
Juvenal occupied the third place, after Dioscorus and the papal legate, having been
specially named by Theodosius, together with Thalassius of Cæsarea (who appears to have
taken no umbrage at his suffragan being preferred before him), as next in authority to Dioscorus
(Labbe, Concil. iv. 109), and he took a leading part in the violent proceedings of that
assembly. When the council of Chalcedon met, one of the matters which came before it for
settlement was the dispute as to priority between Juvenal and Maximus Bishop of Antioch.
The contention was long and severe. It ended in a compromise agreed on in the Seventh
Action, μετὰ πολλὴν φιλονεικίαν . Juvenal surrendered his claim to the two Phoenicias
and to Arabia, on condition of his being allowed metropolitical jurisdiction over the three
Palestines (Labbe, Concil. iv. 613). The claim to patriarchal authority over the Bishop of
Antioch put forward at Ephesus was discreetly dropped. The difficulty presented by the

<pb n="73"/>
Nicene canon does not appear to have presented itself to the council, nor was any one found
to urge the undoubted claims of the see of Cæsarea. The terms arranged between Maximus
and Juvenal were regarded as satisfactory, and received the consent of the assembled bishops
(ibid. 618). Maximus, however, was not long in repenting of his too ready acquiescence in
Juvenal’s demands, and wrote a letter of complaint to pope Leo, who replied by the letter
which has been already quoted, dated June 11, 453 a.d., in which he upheld the binding authority
of the Nicene canons, and commenting in the strongest terms on the greediness and
ambition of Juvenal, who allowed no opportunity of forwarding his ends to be lost, declared
that as far as he was concerned he would do all he could to maintain the ancient dignity of
the see of Antioch (Leo Magn. Ep. ad Maximum, 119 [92]). No further action, however,
seems to have been taken either by Leo or by Maximus. Juvenal was left master of the situation,
and the church of Jerusalem has from that epoch peaceably enjoyed the patriarchal
dignity obtained for it by such base means.</p>

<head>Canon VIII.</head>
<p>Concerning those who call themselves Cathari, if they come over to the Catholic and
Apostolic Church, the great and holy Synod decrees that they who are ordained shall continue
as they are in the clergy. But it is before all things necessary that they should profess
in writing that they will observe and follow the dogmas of the Catholic and Apostolic Church;
in particular that they will communicate with persons who have been twice married, and
with those who having lapsed in persecution have had a period [of penance] laid upon them,
and a time [of restoration] fixed so that in all things they will follow the dogmas of the
Catholic Church. Wheresoever, then, whether in villages or in cities, all of the ordained are
found to be of these only, let them remain in the clergy, and in the same rank in which they
are found. But if they come over where there is a bishop or presbyter of the Catholic Church,
it is manifest that the Bishop of the Church must have the bishop’s dignity; and he who was
named bishop by those who are called Cathari shall have the rank of presbyter, unless it
shall seem fit to the Bishop to admit him to partake in the honour of the title. Or, if this
should not be satisfactory, then shall the bishop provide for him a place as Chorepiscopus,
or presbyter, in order that he may be evidently seen to be of the clergy, and that there may
not be two bishops in the city.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</p>
<p>If those called Cathari come over, let them first make profession that they are willing to
communicate with the twice married, and to grant pardon to the lapsed. And on this condition
he who happens to be in orders, shall continue in the same order, so that a bishop shall still
be bishop. Whoever was a bishop among the Cathari let him, however, become a Chorepiscopus,
or let him enjoy the honour of a presbyter or of a bishop. For in one church there shall not be
two bishops.</p>
<p>The Cathari or Novatians were the followers of Novatian, a presbyter of Rome, who
had been a Stoic philosopher and was delivered, according to his own story, from diabolical
possession at his exorcising by the Church before his baptism, when becoming a Catechumen.
Being in peril of death by illness he received clinical baptism, and was ordained priest
without any further sacred rites being administered to him. During the persecution he
constantly refused to assist his brethren, and afterwards raised his voice against what he
considered their culpable laxity in admitting to penance the lapsed. Many agreed with him
in this, especially of the clergy, and eventually, in a.d. 251, he induced three bishops to
consecrate him, thus becoming, as Fleury remarks,68 “the first Anti-Pope.” His indignation
<note type="footnote">68 Fleury, Hist. Eccles. liv. VI., liij.</note>

<pb n="75"/>
was principally spent upon Pope Cornelius, and to overthrow the prevailing discipline of
the Church he ordained bishops and sent them to different parts of the empire as the disseminators
of his error. It is well to remember that while beginning only as a schismatic,
he soon fell into heresy, denying that the Church had the power to absolve the lapsed. Although
condemned by several councils his sect continued on, and like the Montanists they
rebaptized Catholics who apostatized to them, and absolutely rejected all second marriages.
At the time of the Council of Nice the Novatian bishop at Constantinople, Acesius, was
greatly esteemed, and although a schismatic, was invited to attend the council. After having
in answer to the emperor’s enquiry whether he was willing to sign the Creed, assured him
that he was, he went on to explain that his separation was because the Church no longer
observed the ancient discipline which forbade that those who had committed mortal sin
should ever be readmitted to communion. According to the Novatians he might be exhorted
to repentance, but the Church had no power to assure him of forgiveness but must leave
him to the judgment of God. It was then that Constantine said, “Acesius, take a ladder, and
climb up to heaven alone.”69</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>If any of them be bishops or chorepiscopi they shall remain in the same rank, unless
perchance in the same city there be found a bishop of the Catholic Church, ordained before
their coming. For in this case he that was properly bishop from the first shall have the
preference, and he alone shall retain the Episcopal throne. For it is not right that in the
same city there should be two bishops. But he who by the Cathari was called bishop, shall
be honoured as a presbyter, or (if it so please the bishop), he shall be sharer of the title
bishop; but he shall exercise no episcopal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Zonaras, Balsamon, Beveridge and Van Espen, are of opinion that χειροθετουμένους
does not mean that they are to receive a new laying on of hands at their reception into the
Church, but that it refers to their already condition of being ordained, the meaning being
that as they have had Novatian ordination they must be reckoned among the clergy. Dionysius
Exiguus takes a different view, as does also the Prisca version, according to which
the clergy of the Novatians were to receive a laying on of hands, χειροθετουμένους, but that
it was not to be a reordination. With this interpretation Hefele seems to agree, founding
his opinion upon the fact that the article is wanting before χειροθετουμένους, and that
αὐτοὺς is added. Gratian70 supposes that this eighth canon orders a re-ordination.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Chorepiscopi.</head>
<p>There has been much difference of opinion among the learned touching the status of
the Chorepiscopus in the early Church. The main question in dispute is as to whether they
were always, sometimes, or never, in episcopal orders. Most Anglican writers, including
Beveridge, Hammond, Cave, and Routh, have affirmed the first proposition, that they were
true bishops, but that, out of respect to the bishop of the City they were forbidden the exercise
of certain of their episcopal functions, except upon extraordinary occasions. With this view
Binterim71 also agrees, and Augusti is of the same opinion.72 But Thomassinus is of a different
mind, thinking, so says Hefele,73 that there were “two classes of chorepiscopi, of
whom the one were real bishops, while the other had only the title without consecration.”</p>
<p>The third opinion, that they were merely presbyters, is espoused by Morinus and Du
Cange, and others who are named by Bingham.74 This last opinion is now all but universally
rejected, to the other two we shall now devote our attention.</p>
<p>For the first opinion no one can speak more learnedly nor more authoritatively than
Arthur West Haddon, who writes as follows;</p>
<p>(Haddon, Dict. Christ. Antiq. s.v. Chorepiscopus.)</p>
<p>The chorepiscopus was called into existence in the latter part of the third century, and
first in Asia Minor, in order to meet the want of episcopal supervision in the country parts
of the now enlarged dioceses without subdivision. [They are] first mentioned in the
Councils of Ancyra and Neo-Cæsarea a.d. 314, and again in the Council of Nice (which is
subscribed by fifteen, all from Asia Minor or Syria). [They became] sufficiently important
to require restriction by the time of the Council of Antioch, a.d. 341; and continued to exist
in the East until at least the ninth century, when they were supplanted by ἔξαρχοι.
[Chorepiscopi are] first mentioned in the West in the Council of Riez, a.d. 439 (the Epistles
of Pope Damasus I. and of Leo. M. respecting them being forgeries), and continued there
(but not in Africa, principally in France) until about the tenth century, after which the name
occurs (in a decree of Pope Damasus II. ap. Sigeb. in an. 1048) as equivalent to archdeacon,
an office from which the Arabic Nicene canons expressly distinguish it. The functions of
chorepiscopi, as well as their name, were of an episcopal, not of a presbyterial kind, although
limited to minor offices. They overlooked the country district committed to them, “loco
episcopi,” ordaining readers, exorcists, subdeacons, but, as a rule, not deacons or presbyters
<note type="footnote">71 Binterim, Denkwürdigkeiten, vol. i. part ii. pp. 386–414.</note>

<pb n="77"/>
(and of course not bishops), unless by express permission of their diocesan bishop. They
confirmed in their own districts, and (in Gaul) are mentioned as consecrating churches
(vide Du Cange). They granted εἰρενικαὶ, or letters dimissory, which country presbyters
were forbidden to do. They had also the honorary privilege (τιμώμενοι ) of assisting at the
celebration of the Holy Eucharist in the mother city church, which country presbyters had
not (Conc. Ancyr. can. xiii.; Neo-Cæsar. can. xiv.; Antioch, can. x.; St. Basil M. Epist. 181;
Rab. Maur. De Instit. Cler. i. 5, etc. etc.). They were held therefore to have power of ordination,
but to lack jurisdiction, save subordinately. And the actual ordination of a presbyter
by Timotheus, a chorepiscopus, is recorded (Pallad., Hist. Lausiac. 106).</p>
<p>In the West, i.e. chiefly in Gaul, the order appears to have prevailed more widely, to
have usurped episcopal functions without due subordination to the diocesans, and to have
been also taken advantage of by idle or worldly diocesans. In consequence it seems to have
aroused a strong feeling of hostility, which showed itself, first in a series of papal bulls,
condemning them; headed, it is true, by two forged letters respectively of Damasus I. and
Leo. M. (of which the latter is merely an interpolated version of Conc. Hispal. II. a.d. 619,
can. 7, adding chorepiscopi to presbyteri, of which latter the council really treats), but continuing
in a more genuine form, from Leo III. down to Pope Nicholas I. (to Rodolph,
Archbishop of Bourges, a.d. 864); the last of whom, however, takes the more moderate line
of affirming chorepiscopi to be really bishops, and consequently refusing to annul their ordinations
of presbyters and deacons (as previous popes had done), but orders them to keep
within canonical limits; and secondly, in a series of conciliar decrees, Conc. Ratispon. a.d.
800, in Capit. lib. iv. c. 1, Paris. a.d. 829, lib. i.c. 27; Meld. a.d. 845, can. 44; Metens. a.d. 888,
can. 8, and Capitul. v. 168, vi. 119, vii. 187, 310, 323, 324, annulling all episcopal acts of
chorepiscopi, and ordering them to be repeated by “true” bishops; and finally forbidding
all further appointments of chorepiscopi at all.</p>
<p>That chorepiscopi as such—i.e. omitting the cases of reconciled or vacant bishops above
mentioned, of whose episcopate of course no question is made—were at first truly bishops
both in East and West, appears almost certain, both from their name and functions, and
even from the arguments of their strong opponents just spoken of. If nothing more could
be urged against them, than that the Council of Neo-Cæsarea compared them to the Seventy
disciples, that the Council of Antioch authorises their consecration by a single bishop, and
that they actually were so consecrated (the Antiochene decree might mean merely nomination
by the word γίνεσθαι, but the actual history seems to rule the term to intend consecration,
and the [one] exceptional case of a chorepiscopus recorded [Actt. Episc. Cenoman. ap. Du
Cange] in late times to have been ordained by three bishops [in order that he might be a full
bishop] merely proves the general rule to the contrary)—and that they were consecrated
for “villages,” contrary to canon,—then they certainly were bishops. And Pope Nicholas

<pb n="78"/>
expressly says that they were so. Undoubtedly they ceased to be so in the East, and were
practically merged in archdeacons in the West.</p>
<p>For the second opinion, its great champion, Thomassinus shall speak.</p>
<p>(Thomassin, Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l’Église, Tom. I. Livre II. chap 1. § iii.)</p>
<p>The chorepiscopi were not duly consecrated bishops, unless some bishop had consecrated
a bishop for a town and the bishop thus ordained contrary to the canons was tolerated on
condition of his submitting himself to the diocesan as though he were only a chorepiscopus.
This may be gathered from the fifty-seventh canon of Laodicea.</p>
<p>From this canon two conclusions may be drawn, 1st. That bishops ought not to be ordained
for villages, and that as Chorepiscopi could only be placed in villages they could not
be bishops. 2d. That sometimes by accident a chorepiscopus might be a bishop, but only
through having been canonically lowered to that rank.</p>
<p>The Council of Nice furnishes another example of a bishop lowered to the rank of a
chorepiscopus in Canon viii. This canon shows that they should not have been bishops, for
two bishops could never be in a diocese, although this might accidentally be the case when
a chorepiscopus happened to be a bishop.</p>
<p>This is the meaning which must be given to the tenth canon of Antioch, which directs
that chorepiscopi, even if they have received episcopal orders, and have been consecrated
bishops, shall keep within the limits prescribed by the canon; that in cases of necessity, they
ordain the lower clergy; but that they be careful not to ordain priests or deacons, because
this power is absolutely reserved to the Diocesan. It must be added that as the council of
Antioch commands that the Diocesan without any other bishop can ordain the chorepiscopus,
the position can no longer be sustained that the chorepiscopi were bishops, such a method
of consecrating a bishop being contrary to canon xix. of the same council, moreover the
canon does not say the chorepiscopus is to be ordained, but uses the word γένεσθαι by the
bishop of the city (canon x.). The Council of Neocæsarea by referring them to the seventy
disciples (in Canon XIV.) has shown the chorepiscopi to be only priests.</p>
<p>But the Council of Ancyra does furnish a difficulty, for the text seems to permit
chorepiscopi to ordain priests. But the Greek text must be corrected by the ancient Latin
versions. The letter attributed to pope Nicholas, a.d. 864, must be considered a forgery since
he recognises the chorepiscopi as real bishops.</p>
<p>If Harmenopulus, Aristenus, Balsamon, and Zonaras seem to accord to the chorepiscopi
the power to ordain priests and deacons with the permission of the Diocesan, it is because
they are explaining the meaning and setting forth the practice of the ancient councils and
not the practice of their own times. But at all events it is past all doubt that before the seventh
century there were, by different accidents, chorepiscopi who were really bishops and that

<pb n="79"/>
these could, with the consent of the diocesan, ordain priests. But at the time these authors
wrote, there was not a single chorepiscopus in the entire East, as Balsamon frankly admits
in commenting on Canon xiii. of Ancyra.</p>
<p>Whether in the foregoing the reader will think Thomassinus has proved his point, I do
not know, but so far as the position of the chorepiscopi in synods is concerned there can be
no doubt whatever, and I shall allow Hefele to speak on this point.</p>
<p>(Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. I. pp. 17, 18.)</p>
<p>The Chorepiscopi (χωρεπίσκοποι), or bishops of country places, seem to have been
considered in ancient times as quite on a par with the other bishops, as far as their position
in synod was concerned. We meet with them at the Councils of Neocæsarea in the year
314, of Nicæa in 325, of Ephesus in 431. On the other hand, among the 600 bishops of the
fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451, there is no chorepiscopus present, for by
this time the office had been abolished; but in the Middle Ages we again meet with
chorepiscopi of a new kind at Western councils, particularly at those of the French Church,
at Langres in 830, at Mayence in 847, at Pontion in 876, at Lyons in 886, at Douzy in 871.</p>

<head>Canon IX.</head>
<p>If any presbyters have been advanced without examination, or if upon examination they
have made confession of crime, and men acting in violation of the canon have laid hands
upon them, notwithstanding their confession, such the canon does not admit; for the
Catholic Church requires that <del>only</del> which is blameless.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</p>
<p>Whoever are ordained without examination, shall be deposed if it be found out afterwards
that they had been guilty.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The crimes in question are those which were a bar to the priesthood—such as blasphemy,
bigamy, heresy, idolatry, magic, etc.—as the Arabic paraphrase of Joseph explains. It is clear
that these faults are punishable in the bishop no less than in the priest, and that consequently
our canon refers to the bishops as well as to the πρεσβύτεροι in the more restricted sense.
These words of the Greek text, “In the case in which any one might be induced, in opposition
to the canon, to ordain such persons,” allude to the ninth canon of the Synod of Neocæsarea.
It was necessary to pass such ordinances; for even in the fifth century, as the twenty-second
letter to Pope Innocent the First testifies, some held that as baptism effaces all former sins,
so it takes away all the impedimenta ordinationis which are the results of those sins.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>Some say that as baptism makes the baptized person a new man, so ordination takes
away the sins committed before ordination, which opinion does not seem to agree with the
canons.</p>

<p>Whoso had lapsed are to be deposed whether those who ordained and promoted them did

<p>The tenth canon differs from the ninth, inasmuch as it concerns only the lapsi and their
elevation, not only to the priesthood, but to any other ecclesiastical preferment as well, and
requires their deposition. The punishment of a bishop who should consciously perform
such an ordination is not mentioned; but it is incontestable that the lapsi could not be ordained,
even after having performed penance; for, as the preceding canon states, the Church
requires those who were faultless. It is to be observed that the word προχειρίζειν is evidently
employed here in the sense of “ordain,” and is used without any distinction from χειρίζειν,
whilst in the synodal letter of the Council of Nicæa on the subject of the Meletians, there is
a distinction between these two words, and προχειρίζειν is used to signify eligere.</p>

<p>Concerning those who have fallen without compulsion, without the spoiling of their

declares that, though they have deserved no clemency, they shall be dealt with mercifully.
As many as were communicants, if they heartily repent, shall pass three years among the
hearers; for seven years they shall be prostrators; and for two years they shall communicate
with the people in prayers, but without oblation.</p>

<p>As many as fell without necessity, even if therefore undeserving of indulgence, yet some

Canon V. where the matter is treated at some length.</p>

<p>The usual position of the hearers was just inside the church door. But Zonaras (and
Balsamon agrees with him), in his comment on this canon, says, “they are ordered for three
years to be hearers, or to stand without the church in the narthex.”</p>
<p>I have read “as many as were communicants” (οἱ πιστοὶ) thus following Dr. Routh.

<head>Excursus on the Public Discipline or Exomologesis of the Early Church.</head>
<p>(Taken chiefly from Morinus, De Disciplina in Administratione Sacramenti Poenitentiæ;
Bingham, Antiquities; and Hammond, The Definitions of Faith, etc. Note to Canon XI. of
Nice.)</p>
<p>“In the Primitive Church there was a godly discipline, that at the beginning of Lent,
such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance, and punished
in this world that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that others, admonished
by their example, might be the more afraid to offend.”</p>
<p>The foregoing words from the Commination Service of the Church of England may
serve well to introduce this subject. In the history of the public administration of discipline
in the Church, there are three periods sufficiently distinctly marked. The first of these ends
at the rise of Novatianism in the middle of the second century; the second stretches down
to about the eighth century; and the third period shews its gradual decline to its practical
abandonment in the eleventh century. The period with which we are concerned is the
second, when it was in full force.</p>
<p>In the first period it would seem that public penance was required only of those convicted
of what then were called by pre-eminence “mortal sins” (crimena mortalia75), viz: idolatry,
murder, and adultery. But in the second period the list of mortal sins was greatly enlarged,
and Morinus says that “Many Fathers who wrote after Augustine’s time, extended the necessity
of public penance to all crimes which the civil law punished with death, exile, or other
grave corporal penalty.”76 In the penitential canons ascribed to St. Basil and those which
pass by the name of St. Gregory Nyssen, this increase of offences requiring public penance
will be found intimated.</p>
<p>From the fourth century the penitents of the Church were divided into four classes.
Three of these are mentioned in the eleventh canon, the fourth, which is not here referred
to, was composed of those styled συγκλαίοντες, flentes or weepers. These were not allowed
to enter into the body of the church at all, but stood or lay outside the gates, sometimes
covered with sackcloth and ashes. This is the class which is sometimes styled χειμοζομένοι,
hybernantes, on account of their being obliged to endure the inclemency of the weather.</p>
<p>It may help to the better understanding of this and other canons which notice the different
orders of penitents, to give a brief account of the usual form and arrangement of the
ancient churches as well as of the different orders of the penitents.</p>
<p>Before the church there was commonly either an open area surrounded with porticoes,
called μεσάυλιον or atrium, with a font of water in the centre, styled a cantharus or phiala,
<note type="footnote">75 Cyprian. De Bono Patient., cap. xiv.</note>
<note type="footnote">76 Morinus, De Poenitent., lib. v., cap. 5.</note>

<pb n="84"/>
or sometimes only an open portico, or προπύλαιον. The first variety may still be seen at S.
Ambrogio’s in Milan, and the latter in Rome at S. Lorenzo’s, and in Ravenna at the two S.
Apollinares. This was the place at which the first and lowest order of penitents, the weepers,
already referred to, stood exposed to the weather. Of these, St. Gregory Thaumaturgus says:
“Weeping takes place outside the door of the church, where the sinner must stand and beg
the prayers of the faithful as they go in.”</p>
<p>The church itself usually consisted of three divisions within, besides these exterior courts
and porch. The first part after passing through “the great gates,” or doors of the building,
was called the Narthex in Greek, and Færula in Latin, and was a narrow vestibule extending
the whole width of the church. In this part, to which Jews and Gentiles, and in most places
even heretics and schismatics were admitted, stood the Catechumens, and the Energumens
or those afflicted with evil spirits, and the second class of penitents (the first mentioned in
the Canon), who were called the ἀκοῶμενοι, audientes, or hearers. These were allowed to
hear the Scriptures read, and the Sermon preached, but were obliged to depart before the
celebration of the Divine Mysteries, with the Catechumens, and the others who went by the
general name of hearers only.</p>
<p>The second division, or main body of the church, was called the Naos or Nave. This
was separated from the Narthex by rails of wood, with gates in the centre, which were called
“the beautiful or royal gates.” In the middle of the Nave, but rather toward the lower or
entrance part of it, stood the Ambo, or reading-desk, the place for the readers and singers,
to which they went up by steps, whence the name, Ambo. Before coming to the Ambo, in
the lowest part of the Nave, and just after passing the royal gates, was the place for the third
order of penitents, called in Greek γονυκλίνοντες, or ὑποπίπτοντες, and in Latin Genuflectentes
or Prostrati, i.e., kneelers or prostrators, because they were allowed to remain and
join in certain prayers particularly made for them. Before going out they prostrated themselves
to receive the imposition of the bishop’s hands with prayer. This class of penitents
left with the Catechumens.</p>
<p>In the other parts of the Nave stood the believers or faithful, i.e., those persons who
were in full communion with the Church, the men and women generally on opposite sides,
though in some places the men were below, and the women in galleries above. Amongst
these were the fourth class of penitents, who were called συνεστῶτες, consistentes, i.e., costanders,
because they were allowed to stand with the faithful, and to remain and hear the
prayers of the Church, after the Catechumens and the other penitents were dismissed, and
to be present while the faithful offered and communicated, though they might not themselves
make their offerings, nor partake of the Holy Communion. This class of penitents are frequently
mentioned in the canons, as “communicating in prayers,” or “without the oblation;”
and it was the last grade to be passed through previous to the being admitted again to full
communion. The practice of “hearing mass” or “non-communicating attendance” clearly

<pb n="85"/>
had its origin in this stage of discipline. At the upper end of the body of the church, and
divided from it by rails which were called Cancelli, was that part which we now call the
Chancel. This was anciently called by several names, as Bema or tribunal, from its being
raised above the body of the church, and Sacrarium or Sanctuary. It was also called Apsis
and Concha Bematis, from its semicircular end. In this part stood the Altar, or Holy Table
(which names were indifferently used in the primitive Church), behind which, and against
the wall of the chancel, was the Bishop’s throne, with the seats of the Presbyters on each
side of it, called synthronus. On one side of the chancel was the repository for the sacred
utensils and vestments, called the Diaconicum, and answering to our Vestry; and on the
other the Prothesis, a side-table, or place, where the bread and wine were deposited before
they were offered on the Altar. The gates in the chancel rail were called the holy gates, and
none but the higher orders of the clergy, i.e., Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, were allowed
to enter within them. The Emperor indeed was permitted to do so for the purpose of making
his offering at the Altar, but then he was obliged to retire immediately, and to receive the
communion without.</p>
<p>(Thomassin. Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l’Eglise. Tom. I. Livre II. chap. xvj. somewhat
abridged.)</p>
<p>In the West there existed always many cases of public penance, but in the East it is more
difficult to find any traces of it, after it was abolished by the Patriarch Nectarius in the person
of the Grand Penitentiary.</p>
<p>However, the Emperor Alexis Comnenus, who took the empire in the year 1080, did a
penance like that of older days, and one which may well pass for miraculous. He called together
a large number of bishops with the patriarch, and some holy religious; he presented
himself before them in the garb of a criminal; he confessed to them his crime of usurpation
with all its circumstances. They condemned the Emperor and all his accomplices to fasting,
to lying prostrate upon the earth, to wearing haircloth, and to all the other ordinary austerities
of penance. Their wives desired to share their griefs and their sufferings, although they
had had no share in their crime. The whole palace became a theatre of sorrow and public
penance. The emperor wore the hairshirt under the purple, and lay upon the earth for forty
days, having only a stone for a pillow.</p>
<p>To all practical purposes Public Penance was a general institution but for a short while
in the Church. But the reader must be careful to distinguish between this Public Penance
and the private confession which in the Catholic Church both East and West is universally
practised. What Nectarius did was to abolish the office of Penitentiary, whose duty it had

<pb n="86"/>
been to assign public penance for secret sin;77 a thing wholly different from what Catholics
understand by the “Sacrament of Penance.” It would be out of place to do more in this place
than to call the reader’s attention to the bare fact, and to supply him, from a Roman Catholic
point of view, with an explanation of why Public Penance died out. “It came to an end because
it was of human institution. But sacramental confession, being of divine origin, lasted
when the penitential discipline had been changed, and continues to this day among the
Greeks and Oriental sects.”78 That the reader may judge of the absolute candour of the
writer just quoted, I give a few sentences from the same article: “An opinion, however, did
prevail to some extent in the middle ages, even among Catholics, that confession to God
alone sufficed. The Council of Châlons in 813 (canon xxxiij.), says: ‘Some assert that we
should confess our sins to God alone, but some think that they should be confessed to the
priest, each of which practices is followed not without great fruit in Holy Church.…Confession
made to God purges sins, but that made to the priest teaches how they are to be purged.’
This former opinion is also mentioned without reprobation by Peter Lombard (In Sentent.
Lib. iv. dist. xvij.).”</p>

<p>As many as were called by grace, and displayed the first zeal, having cast aside their
military girdles, but afterwards returned, like dogs, to their own vomit, (so that some spent
money and by means of gifts regained their military stations); let these, after they have
passed the space of three years as hearers, be for ten years prostrators. But in all these cases
it is necessary to examine well into their purpose and what their repentance appears to be
like. For as many as give evidence of their conversions by deeds, and not pretence, with
fear, and tears, and perseverance, and good works, when they have fulfilled their appointed
time as hearers, may properly communicate in prayers; and after that the bishop may determine
yet more favourably concerning them. But those who take <del>the matter</del> with indifference,
and who think the form of <del>not</del> entering the Church is sufficient for their conversion,
must fulfil the whole time.</p>

<p>The abuse of this power, namely, of granting under certain circumstances a relaxation
in the penitential exercises enjoined by the canons—led, in later times, to the practice of
commuting such exercises for money payments, etc.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>In his last contests with Constantine, Licinius had made himself the representative of
heathenism; so that the final issue of the war would not be the mere triumph of one of the
two competitors, but the triumph or fall of Christianity or heathenism. Accordingly, a
Christian who had in this war supported the cause of Licinius and of heathenism might be
considered as a lapsus, even if he did not formally fall away. With much more reason might
those Christians be treated as lapsi who, having conscientiously given up military service
(this is meant by the soldier’s belt), afterwards retracted their resolution, and went so far as
to give money and presents for the sake of readmission, on account of the numerous advantages
which military service then afforded. It must not be forgotten that Licinius, as Zonaras

<pb n="88"/>
and Eusebius relate, required from his soldiers a formal apostasy; compelled them, for example,
to take part in the heathen sacrifices which were held in the camps, and dismissed
from his service those who would not apostatize.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>This canon (which in the Prisca and the Isidorian version stands as part of canon 11)
deals, like it, with cases which had arisen under the Eastern reign of Licinius, who having
resolved to “purge his army of all ardent Christians” (Mason, Persec. of Diocl. p. 308), ordered
his Christian officers to sacrifice to the gods on pain of being cashiered (compare Euseb. H.
E. x. 8; Vit. Con. i. 54). It is to be observed here that military life as such was not deemed
unchristian. The case of Cornelius was borne in mind. “We serve in your armies,” says
Tertullian, Apol. 42 (although later, as a Montanist, he took a rigorist and fanatical view, De
Cor. 11), and compare the fact which underlies the tale of the “Thundering Legion,”—the
presence of Christians in the army of Marcus Aurelius. It was the heathenish adjuncts to
their calling which often brought Christian soldiers to a stand (see Routh. Scr. Opusc. i. 410),
as when Marinus’ succession to a centurionship was challenged on the ground that he could
not sacrifice to the gods (Euseb. H. E. vii. 15). Sometimes, indeed, individual Christians
thought like Maximilian in the Martyrology, who absolutely refused to enlist, and on being
told by the proconsul that there were Christian soldiers in the imperial service, answered,
“Ipsi sciunt quod ipsis expediat” (Ruinart, Act. Sanc. p. 341). But, says Bingham (Antiq. xi.
5, 10), “the ancient canons did not condemn the military life as a vocation simply unlawful.…I
believe there is no instance of any man being refused baptism merely because he was a soldier,
unless some unlawful circumstance, such as idolatry, or the like, made the vocation sinful.”
After the victory of Constantine in the West, the Council of Arles excommunicated those
who in time of peace “threw away their arms” (can. 2). In the case before us, some Christian
officers had at first stood firm under the trial imposed on them by Licinius. They had been
“called by grace” to an act of self-sacrifice (the phrase is one which St. Augustine might have
used); and had shown “their eagerness at the outset” (“primum suum ardorem,” Dionysius;
Philo and Evarestus more laxly, “primordia bona;” compare τὴν ἀγάπην σου τὴν πρώτην,
Rev. ii. 4). Observe here how beautifully the ideas of grace and free will are harmonized.
These men had responded to a Divine impulse: it might seem that they had committed
themselves to a noble course: they had cast aside the “belts” which were their badge of office
(compare the cases of Valentinian and Valens, Soc. iii. 13, and of Benevolus throwing down
his belt at the feet of Justina, Soz. vii. 13). They had done, in fact, just what Auxentius, one
of Licinius’ notaries, had done when, according to the graphic anecdote of Philostorgius
(Fragm. 5), his master bade him place a bunch of grapes before a statue of Bacchus in the
palace-court; but their zeal, unlike his, proved to be too impulsive—they reconsidered their

<pb n="89"/>
position, and illustrated the maxim that in morals second thoughts are not best (Butler,
Serm. 7), by making unworthy attempts—in some cases by bribery—to recover what they
had worthily resigned. (Observe the Grecised Latinism βενεφικίοις and compare the Latinisms
of St. Mark, and others in Euseb. iii. 20, vi. 40, x. 5.) This the Council describes in
proverbial language, probably borrowed from 2 Pet. ii. 22, but, it is needless to say, without
intending to censure enlistment as such. They now desired to be received to penance: accordingly
they were ordered to spend three years as Hearers, during which time “their
purpose, and the nature (εἶδος) of their repentance” were to be carefully “examined.” Again
we see the earnest resolution of the Council to make discipline a moral reality, and to prevent
it from being turned into a formal routine; to secure, as Rufinus’ abridgment expresses it,
a repentance “fructuosam et attentam.” If the penitents were found to have “manifested
their conversion by deeds, and not in outward show (σχήματι), by awe, and tears, and patience,
and good works” (such, for instance, Zonaras comments, as almsgiving according
to ability), “it would be then reasonable to admit them to a participation in the prayers,” to
the position of Consistentes, “with permission also to the bishop to come to a yet more indulgent
resolution concerning them,” by admitting them to full communion. This discretionary
power of the bishop to dispense with part of a penance-time is recognized in the
fifth canon of Ancyra and the sixteenth of Chalcedon, and mentioned by Basil, Epist. 217,
c. 74. It was the basis of “indulgences” in their original form (Bingham, xviii. 4, 9). But it
was too possible that some at least of these lapsi might take the whole affair lightly, “with
indifference” ἀδιαφόρως —not seriously enough, as Hervetas renders—just as if, in common
parlance, it did not signify: the fourth Ancyrene canon speaks of lapsi who partook of the
idol-feast ἀδιαφόρως as if it involved them in no sin (see below on Eph. 5, Chalc. 4). It was
possible that they might “deem” the outward form of “entering the church” to stand in the
narthex among the Hearers (here, as in c. 8, 19, σχῆμα denotes an external visible fact) sufficient
to entitle them to the character of converted penitents, while their conduct out of
church was utterly lacking in seriousness and self-humiliation. In that case there could be
no question of shortening their penance time, for they were not in a state to benefit by indulgence:
it would be, as the Roman Presbyters wrote to Cyprian, and as he himself wrote
to his own church, a “mere covering over of the wound” (Epist. 30, 3), an “injury” rather
than “a kindness” (De Lapsis, 16); they must therefore “by all means” go through ten years
as Kneelers, before they can become Consistentes.</p>
<p>There is great difficulty about the last phrase and Gelasius of Cyzicus, the Prisca, Dionysius
Exiguus, the pseudo-Isidore, Zonaras and most others have considered the “not”
an interpolation. I do not see how dropping the “not” makes the meaning materially
clearer.</p>

<head>Canon XIII.</head>
<p>Concerning the departing, the ancient canonical law is still to be maintained, to wit,
that, if any man be at the point of death, he must not be deprived of the last and most indispensable
Viaticum. But, if any one should be restored to health again who has received the
communion when his life was despaired of, let him remain among those who communicate
in prayers only. But in general, and in the case of any dying person whatsoever asking to
receive the Eucharist, let the Bishop, after examination made, give it him.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</p>
<p>The dying are to be communicated. But if any such get well, he must be placed in the
number of those who share in the prayers, and with these only.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that antiquity used the name “Viaticum” not only to denote the
Eucharist which was given to the dying, but also to denote the reconciliation, and imposition
of penance, and in general, everything that could be conducive to the happy death of the
person concerned, and this has been shown by Aubespine (lib. 1, Obs. cap. ii.). But while
this is so, the more usual sense of the word is the Eucharist. For this cannot be denied that
the faithful of the first ages of the Church looked upon the Eucharist as the complement of
Christian perfection, and as the last seal of hope and salvation. It was for this reason that
at the beginning of life, after baptism and confirmation, the Eucharist was given even to
infants, and at the close of life the Eucharist followed reconciliation and extreme unction,
so that properly and literally it could be styled “the last Viaticum.” Moreover for penitents
it was considered especially necessary that through it they might return to the peace of the
Church; for perfect peace is given by that very communion of the Eucharist. [A number of
instances are then cited, and various ancient versions of the canon.] Balsamon and Zonaras
also understand the canon as I have done, as is evident from their commentaries, and so
did Josephus Ægyptius, who in his Arabic Paraphrase gives the canon this title: “Concerning
him who is excommunicated and has committed some deadly sin, and desires the Eucharist
to be granted to him.”</p>

<p>There is nothing upon which the ancient church more strenuously insisted than the
oral reception of the Holy Communion. What in later times was known as “Spiritual
Communion” was outside of the view of those early days; and to them the issues of eternity
were considered often to rest upon the sick man’s receiving with his mouth “his food for
the journey,” the Viaticum, before he died. No greater proof of how important this matter
was deemed could be found than the present canon, which provides that even the stern and
invariable canons of the public penance are to give way before the awful necessity of fortifying
the soul in the last hour of its earthly sojourn.</p>
<p>Possibly at first the holy Sacrament may have been consecrated in the presence of the
sick person, but of this in early times the instances are rare and by no means clear. In fact
it was considered a marked favour that such a thing should be allowed, and the saying of
mass in private houses was prohibited (as it is in the Eastern and Latin churches still to-day)
with the greatest rigour.</p>
<p>The necessity of having the consecrated bread and wine for the sick led to their reservation,
a practice which has existed in the Church from the very beginning, so far as any records
of which we are in possession shew.</p>
<p>St. Justin Martyr, writing less than a half century after St. John’s death, mentions that
“the deacons communicate each of those present, and carry away to the absent the blest
bread, and wine and water.”79 It was evidently a long established custom in his day.</p>
<p>Tertullian tells us of a woman whose husband was a heathen and who was allowed to
keep the Holy Sacrament in her house that she might receive every morning before other
food. St. Cyprian also gives a most interesting example of reservation. In his treatise “On
the Lapsed” written in a.d. 251, (chapter xxvi), he says: “Another woman, when she tried
with unworthy hands to open her box, in which was the Holy of the Lord, was deterred from
daring to touch it by fire rising from it.”</p>
<p>It is impossible with any accuracy to fix the date, but certainly before the year four
hundred, a perpetual reservation for the sick was made in the churches. A most interesting
incidental proof of this is found in the thrilling description given by St. Chrysostom of the
great riot in Constantinople in the year 403, when the soldiers “burst into the place where
the Holy Things were stored, and saw all things therein,” and “the most holy blood of Christ
was spilled upon their clothes.”80 From this incident it is evident that in that church the
Holy Sacrament was reserved in both kinds, and separately.</p>
<note type="footnote">79 Just. M. Apol. I. cap. lxv.</note>
<note type="footnote">80 Chrys. Ep. ad Innoc. Sec. 3.</note>

<pb n="92"/>
<p>Whether this at the time was usual it is hard to say, but there can be no doubt that even
in the earliest times the Sacrament was given, on rare occasions at least, in one kind, sometimes
under the form of bread alone, and when the sick persons could not swallow under
the form of wine alone. The practice called “intinction,” that is the dipping of the bread
into the wine and administering the two species together, was of very early introduction
and still is universal in the East, not only when Communion is given with the reserved Sacrament,
but also when the people are communicated in the Liturgy from the newly consecrated
species. The first mention of intinction in the West, is at Carthage in the fifth century.
81 We know it was practised in the seventh century and by the twelfth it had become
general, to give place to the withdrawal of the chalice altogether in the West.82 “Regino (De
Eccles. Discip. Lib. I. c. lxx.) in 906, Burchard (Decr. Lib. V. cap. ix. fol. 95. colon. 1560.) in
996, and Ivo (Decr. Pars. II. cap. xix. p. 56, Paris 1647) in 1092 all cite a Canon, which they
ascribe to a council of Tours ordering ‘every presbyter to have a pyx or vessel meet for so
great a sacrament, in which the Body of the Lord may be carefully laid up for the Viaticum
to those departing from this world, which sacred oblation ought to be steeped in the Blood
of Christ that the presbyter may be able to say truthfully to the sick man, The Body and
Blood of the Lord avail thee, etc.’”83</p>
<p>The reservation of the Holy Sacrament was usually made in the church itself, and the
learned W. E. Scudamore is of opinion that this was the case in Africa as early as the fourth
century.84</p>
<p>It will not be uninteresting to quote in this connection the “Apostolic Constitutions,”
for while indeed there is much doubt of the date of the Eighth Book, yet it is certainly of
great antiquity. Here we read, “and after the communion of both men and women, the
deacons take what remains and place it in the tabernacle.”85</p>
<note type="footnote">81 I give the reference as in Scudamore’s Not. Euch. from which I have taken it. De Prom. et Præd. Dei; Dimid.

so distinguished a writer as Pierre Le Brun adopts the later meaning, the no less famous Durant, together with
most commentators, translate as I have done above. In either case for the present purpose, the quotation is
conclusive of the practice of the primitive church in regard to this matter. Liddell and Scott give “παστοφόρος,

<p>Perhaps it may not be amiss before closing the remark that so far as we are aware the
reservation of the Holy Sacrament in the early church was only for the purposes of communion,
and that the churches of the East reserve it to the present day only for this purpose.
Those who wish to read the matter treated of more at length, can do so in Muratorius’s
learned “Dissertations” which are prefixed to his edition of the Roman Sacramentaries
(chapter XXIV) and in Scudamore’s Notitia Eucharistica, a work which can be absolutely
relied upon for the accuracy of its facts, however little one may feel constrained to accept
the logical justness of its conclusions.</p>

<head>Canon XIV.</head>
<p>Concerning catechumens who have lapsed, the holy and great Synod has decreed that,
after they have passed three years only as hearers, they shall pray with the catechumens.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.
If any of the catechumens shall have fallen for three years he shall be a hearer only, and
then let him pray with the catechumens.</p>
<p>Justellus.</p>
<p>The people formerly were divided into three classes in the church, for there were catechumens,
faithful, and penitents; but it is clear from the present canon there were two
kinds of catechumens: one consisting of those who heard the Word of God, and wished to
become Christians, but had not yet desired baptism; these were called “hearers.” Others
who were of long standing, and were properly trained in the faith, and desired baptism—these
were called “competentes.”</p>
<p>There is difference of opinion among the learned as to whether there was not a third or
even a fourth class of catechumens. Bingham and Card. Bona, while not agreeing in particular
points, agree in affirming that there were more than two classes. Bingham’s first class
are those not allowed to enter the church, the ἐξωθούμενοι , but the affirmation of the existence
of such a class rests only on a very forced explanation of canon five of Neocæsarea.
The second class, the hearers, audientes, rests on better evidence. These were not allowed
to stay while the Holy Mysteries were celebrated, and their expulsion gave rise to the distinction
between the “Mass of the Catechumens” (Missa Catechumenorum) and the “Mass of
the Faithful” (Missa Fidelium). Nor were they suffered to hear the Creed or the Our Father.
Writers who multiply the classes insert here some who knelt and prayed, called Prostrati or
Genuflectentes (the same name as was given to one of the grades of penitence).
(Edw. H. Plumptre in Dict. Christ. Antiq. s.v. Catechumens.)</p>
<p>After these stages had been traversed each with its appropriate instruction, the catechumens
gave in their names as applicants for baptism, and were known accordingly as Competentes
(συναιτοῦντες ). This was done commonly at the beginning of the Quadragesimal
fast, and the instruction, carried on through the whole of that period, was fuller and more
public in its nature (Cyril Hieros. Catech. i. 5; Hieron. Ep. 61, ad Pammach. c. 4). To catechumens
in this stage the great articles of the Creed, the nature of the Sacraments, the
penitential discipline of the Church, were explained, as in the Catechetical Lectures of Cyril

<pb n="95"/>
of Jerusalem, with dogmatic precision. Special examinations and inquiries into character
were made at intervals during the forty days. It was a time for fasting and watching and
prayer (Const. Apost. viii. 5; 4 C. Carth. c. 85; Tertull. De Bapt. c. 20; Cyril. l. c.) and, in the
case of those who were married, of the strictest continence (August. De fide et oper. v. 8).
Those who passed through the ordeal were known as the perfectiores (τελειώτεροι ), the
electi, or in the nomenclature of the Eastern Church as βαπτιζόμενοι or φωτιζόμενοι , the
present participle being used of course with a future or gerundial sense. Their names were
inscribed as such in the album or register of the church. They were taught, but not till a few
days before their baptism, the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer which they were to use after it.
The periods for this registration varied, naturally enough, in different churches. At Jerusalem
it was done on the second (Cyril. Catech. iii.), in Africa on the fourth Sunday in Lent (August.
Serm. 213), and this was the time at which the candidate, if so disposed, might lay aside his
old heathen or Jewish name and take one more specifically Christian (Socrat. H. E. vii.
21).…It is only necessary to notice here that the Sacramentum Catechumenorum of which
Augustine speaks (De Peccat. Merit. ii. 26) as given apparently at or about the time of their
first admission by imposition of hands, was probably the εὐλογίαι or panis benedictus, and
not, as Bingham and Augusti maintain, the salt which was given with milk and honey after
baptism.</p>

bishop, presbyter, nor deacon shall pass from city to city. And if any one, after this decree

his proceedings shall be utterly void, and he shall be restored to the Church for which he

<p>Neither bishop, presbyter, nor deacon shall pass from city to city. But they shall be sent
back, should they attempt to do so, to the Churches in which they were ordained.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The translation of a bishop, priest, or deacon from one church to another, had already
been forbidden in the primitive Church. Nevertheless, several translations had taken place,
and even at the Council of Nice several eminent men were present who had left their first
bishoprics to take others: thus Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia, had been before Bishop of
Berytus; Eustathius, Bishop of Antioch, had been before Bishop of Berrhoea in Syria. The
Council of Nice thought it necessary to forbid in future these translations, and to declare
them invalid. The chief reason of this prohibition was found in the irregularities and disputes
occasioned by such change of sees; but even if such practical difficulties had not arisen, the
whole doctrinal idea, so to speak, of the relationship between a cleric and the church to
which he had been ordained, namely, the contracting of a mystical marriage between them,
would be opposed to any translation or change. In 341 the Synod of Antioch renewed, in
its twenty-first canon, the prohibition passed by the Council of Nice; but the interest of the
Church often rendered it necessary to make exceptions, as happened in the case of St.
Chrysostom. These exceptional cases increased almost immediately after the holding of the
Council of Nice, so that in 382, St. Gregory of Nazianzum considered this law among those
which had long been abrogated by custom. It was more strictly observed in the Latin Church;
and even Gregory’s contemporary, Pope Damasus, declared himself decidedly in favour of
the rule of Nice.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Translation of Bishops.</head>
<p>There are few points upon which the discipline of the Church has so completely changed
as that which regulated, or rather which forbade, the translation of a bishop from the see
for which he was consecrated to some other diocese. The grounds on which such prohibition
rested were usually that such changes were the outcome of ambition, and that if tolerated
the result would be that smaller and less important sees would be despised, and that there
would be a constant temptation to the bishops of such sees to make themselves popular
with the important persons in other dioceses with the hope of promotion. Besides this objection
to translation, St. Athanasius mentions a spiritual one, that the diocese was the
bishop’s bride, and that to desert it and take another was an act of unjustifiable divorce, and
subsequent adultery.86 Canon XIV. of the Apostolic Canons does not forbid the practice
absolutely, but allows it for just cause, and although the Council of Nice is more stringent
so far as its words are concerned, apparently forbidding translation under any circumstances,
yet, as a matter of fact, that very council did allow and approve a translation.87 The general
feeling, however, of the early Church was certainly very strong against all such changes of
Episcopal cure, and there can be no doubt that the chief reason why St. Gregory Nazianzen
resigned the Presidency of the First Council of Constantinople, was because he had been
translated from his obscure see Sasima (not Nazianzum as Socrates and Jerome say) to the
Imperial City.88</p>
<p>From the canons of some provincial councils, and especially from those of the Third
and of the Fourth Council of Carthage, it is evident that despite the conciliar and papal
prohibitions, translations did take place, being made by the authority of the provincial
Synods, and without the consent of the pope,89 but it is also evident that this authority was
too weak, and that the aid of the secular power had often to be invoked.</p>

<note type="footnote">88 By no one has this whole matter of the translation of bishops been more carefully and thoroughly treated
than by Thomassinus, and in what follows I shall use his discussion as a thesaurus of facts. The title of his book
is Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l’Église (there is also an edition in Latin). In the Third Part, and the Second
Book, Chapter LX. treats of “Translations of bishops in the Latin Church during the first five centuries.” Chapter
LXI. “Translations in the Eastern Church, during the first five centuries.” Chapter LXII. “Translation of bishops
and bishoprics between the years five hundred and eight hundred.” Chapter LXIII. “Translation under the empire
of Charlemagne and his descendants.” Chapter LXIV. “Translation of bishops after the year one thousand.” Of
all this I can in the text give but a brief resumé.</note>
<note type="footnote">89 Thomassin. l. c. lx. viij.</note>

<pb n="98"/>
<p>This course, of having the matter decided by the synod, was exactly in accordance with
the Apostolic Canon (no. xiv.). In this manner, for example, Alexander was translated from
Cappadocia to Jerusalem, a translation made, so it is narrated, in obedience to heavenly
revelation.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that the Nicene Canon does not forbid Provincial Councils to translate
bishops, but forbids bishops to translate themselves, and the author of the tract De Translationibus
in the Jus Orient. (i. 293, Cit. Haddon. Art. “Bishop,” Smith and Cheetham, Dict.
Chr. Antiq.) sums up the matter tersely in the statement that ἡ μετάβασις κεκώλυται, οὐ
μὴν ἥ μετάθεσις: i.e., the thing prohibited is “transmigration” (which arises from the bishop
himself, from selfish motives) not “translation” (wherein the will of God and the good of
the Church is the ruling cause); the “going,” not the “being taken” to another see. And this
was the practice both of East and West, for many centuries. Roman Catholic writers have
tried to prove that translations, at least to the chief sees, required the papal consent, but
Thomassinus, considering the case of St. Meletius having translated St. Gregory of Nazianzum
to Constantinople, admits that in so doing he “would only have followed the example of
many great bishops of the first ages, when usage had not yet reserved translations to the
first see of the Church.”90</p>
<p>But the same learned author frankly confesses that in France, Spain, and England,
translations were made until the ninth century without consulting the pope at all, by bishops
and kings. When, however, from grounds of simple ambition, Anthimus was translated
from Trebizonde to Constantinople, the religious of the city wrote to the pope, as also did
the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem, and as a result the Emperor Justinian allowed
Anthimus to be deposed.91</p>
<p>Balsamon distinguishes three kinds of translations. The first, when a bishop of marked
learning and of equal piety is forced by a council to pass from a small diocese to one far
greater where he will be able to do the Church the most important services, as was the case
when St. Gregory of Nazianzum was transferred from Sasima to Constantinople, μετάθεσις;
the second when a bishop, whose see has been laid low by the barbarians, is transferred to
another see which is vacant, μετάβασις; and the third when a bishop, either having or lacking
a see, seizes on a bishopric which is vacant, on his own proper authority ἀνάβασις. It is this
last which the Council of Sardica punishes so severely. In all these remarks of Balsamon
there is no mention of the imperial power.</p>
<p>Demetrius Chomatenus, however, who was Archbishop of Thessalonica, and wrote a
series of answers to Cabasilas, Archbishop of Durazzo, says that by the command of the
<note type="footnote">90 Thomassin, l. cit., Chap. LI., § xiij.</note>
<note type="footnote">91 This is Thomassinus’s version of the matter, in fact the charge of heresy was also made against Anthimus,
but his uncanonical translation was a real count in the accusation.</note>

<pb n="99"/>
Emperor a bishop, elected and confirmed, and even ready to be ordained for a diocese, may
be forced to take the charge of another one which is more important, and where his services
will be incomparably more useful to the public. Thus we read in the Book of Eastern Law
that “If a Metropolitan with his synod, moved by a praiseworthy cause and probable pretext,
shall give his approbation to the translation of a bishop, this can, without doubt, be done,
for the good of souls and for the better administration of the church’s affairs, etc.”92 This
was adopted at a synod held by the patriarch Manuel at Constantinople, in the presence of
the imperial commissioners.</p>
<p>The same thing appears also in the synodal response of the patriarch Michael, which
only demands for translation the authority of the Metropolitan and “the greatest authority
of the Church.”93 But, soon after this, translation became the rule, and not the exception
both in East and West.</p>
<p>It was in vain that Simeon, Archbishop of Thessalonica, in the East raised his voice
against the constant translations made by the secular power, and the Emperors of Constantinople
were often absolute masters of the choice and translations of bishops; and
Thomassinus sums up the matter, “At the least we are forced to the conclusion that no
translations could be made without the consent of the Emperor, especially when it was the
See of Constantinople that was to be filled.”</p>
<p>The same learned writer continues: “It was usually the bishop or archbishop of another
church that was chosen to ascend the patriarchal throne of the imperial city. The Kings of
England often used this same power to appoint to the Primatial See of Canterbury a bishop
already approved in the government of another diocese.”94</p>
<p>In the West, Cardinal Bellarmine disapproved the prevailing custom of translations and
protested against it to his master, Pope Clement VIII., reminding him that they were contrary
to the canons and contrary to the usage of the Ancient Church, except in cases of necessity
and of great gain to the Church. The pope entirely agreed with these wise observations, and
promised that he would himself make, and would urge princes to make, translations only
“with difficulty.” But translations are made universally, all the world over, today, and no
attention whatever is paid to the ancient canons and discipline of the Church.95</p>

off and in his own Church ordain a man belonging to another, without the consent of his

let the ordination be void.</p>

<p>Such presbyters or deacons as desert their own Church are not to be admitted into another,
but are to be sent back to their own diocese. But if any bishop should ordain one who belongs
to another Church without the consent of his own bishop, the ordination shall be cancelled.</p>
<p>“Parish” in this canon, as so often elsewhere, means “diocese.”</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>It seemed right that the clergy should have no power to move from city to city and to
change their canonical residence without letters dimissory from the bishop who ordained
them. But such clerics as are called by the bishops who ordained them and cannot be persuaded
to return, are to be separated from communion, that is to say, not to be allowed to
concelebrate (συνιερουργεῖν) with them, for this is the meaning of “excommunicated” in
this place, and not that they should not enter the church nor receive the sacraments. This
decree agrees with canon xv. of the Apostolical canons, which provides that such shall not
celebrate the liturgy. Canon xvj. of the same Apostolical canons further provides that if a
bishop receive a cleric coming to him from another diocese without his bishop’s letters dimissory,
and shall ordain him, such a bishop shall be separated. From all this it is evident
that the Chartophylax of the Great Church for the time does rightly in refusing to allow
priests ordained in other dioceses to offer the sacrifice unless they bring with them letters
commendatory and dimissory from those who ordained them.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as many enrolled among the Clergy, following covetousness and lust of gain,
have forgotten the divine Scripture, which says, “He hath not given his money upon usury,”
and in lending money ask the hundredth of the sum [as monthly interest], the holy and
great Synod thinks it just that if after this decree any one be found to receive usury, whether
he accomplish it by secret transaction or otherwise, as by demanding the whole and one
half, or by using any other contrivance whatever for filthy lucre’s sake, he shall be deposed
from the clergy and his name stricken from the list.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.</p>
<p>If anyone shall receive usury or 150 per cent, he shall be cast forth and deposed, according
to this decree of the Church.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Although the canon expresses only these two species of usury, if we bear in mind the
grounds on which the prohibition was made, it will be manifest that every kind of usury is
forbidden to clerics and under any circumstances, and therefore the translation of this
canon sent by the Orientals to the Sixth Council of Carthage is in no respect alien to the
true intent of the canon; for in this version no mention is made of any particular kind of
usury, but generally the penalty is assigned to any clerics who “shall be found after this decree
taking usury” or thinking out any other scheme for the sake of filthy lucre.</p>
<p>This Canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, in the first part of the Decretum, in

<head>Excursus on Usury.</head>
<p>The famous canonist Van Espen defines usury thus: “Usura definitur lucrum ex mutuo
exactum aut speratum;”96 and then goes on to defend the proposition that, “Usury is forbidden
by natural, by divine, and by human law. The first is proved thus. Natural law, as far
as its first principles are concerned, is contained in the decalogue; but usury is prohibited
in the decalogue, inasmuch as theft is prohibited; and this is the opinion of the Master of
the Sentences, of St. Bonaventura, of St. Thomas and of a host of others: for by the name
of theft in the Law all unlawful taking of another’s goods is prohibited; but usury is an unlawful,
etc.” For a proof of usury’s being contrary to divine law he cites Ex. xxii. 25, and
Deut. xxiii. 29; and from the New Testament Luke vi. 34. “The third assertion is proved
thus. Usury is forbidden by human law: The First Council of Nice in Canon VII. deposed
from the clergy and from all ecclesiastical rank, clerics who took usury; and the same thing
is the case with an infinite number of councils, in fact with nearly all e.g. Elvira, ij, Arles j,
Carthage iij, Tours iij, etc. Nay, even the pagans themselves formerly forbid it by their laws.”
He then quotes Tacitus (Annal. lib. v.), and adds, “with what severe laws the French Kings
coerced usurers is evident from the edicts of St. Louis, Philip IV., Charles IX., Henry III.,
etc.”</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that Van Espen in the foregoing has accurately represented and
without any exaggeration the universal opinion of all teachers of morals, theologians, doctors,
Popes, and Councils of the Christian Church for the first fifteen hundred years. All interest
exacted upon loans of money was looked upon as usury, and its reception was esteemed a
form of theft and dishonesty. Those who wish to read the history of the matter in all its
details are referred to Bossuet’s work on the subject, Traité de l’Usure,97 where they will find
the old, traditional view of the Christian religion defended by one thoroughly acquainted
with all that could be said on the other side.</p>
<p>The glory of inventing the new moral code on the subject, by which that which before
was looked upon as mortal sin has been transfigured into innocence, if not virtue, belongs
to John Calvin! He made the modern distinction between “interest” and “usury,” and was
the first to write in defence of this then new-fangled refinement of casuistry.98 Luther violently
opposed him, and Melancthon also kept to the old doctrine, though less violently (as
was to be expected); today the whole Christian West, Protestant and Catholic alike, stake
their salvation upon the truth of Calvin’s distinction! Among Roman Catholics the new

doctrine began to be defended about the beginning of the eighteenth century, the work of
Scipio Maffei, Dell’ impiego dell danaro, written on the laxer side, having attracted a widespread
attention. The Ballerini affirm that the learned pope Benedict XIV. allowed books
defending the new morals to be dedicated to him, and in 1830 the Congregation of the Holy
Office with the approval of the reigning Pontiff, Pius VIII., decided that those who considered
the taking of interest allowed by the state law justifiable, were “not to be disturbed.” It is
entirely disingenuous to attempt to reconcile the modern with the ancient doctrine; the
Fathers expressly deny that the State has any power to make the receiving of interest just or
to fix its rate, there is but one ground for those to take who accept the new teaching, viz.
that all the ancients, while true on the moral principle that one must not defraud his
neighbour nor take unjust advantage of his necessity, were in error concerning the facts, in
that they supposed that money was barren, an opinion which the Schoolmen also held, following
Aristotle. This we have found in modern times, and amid modern circumstances,
to be an entire error, as Gury, the famous modern casuist, well says, “fructum producit et
multiplicatur per se.”99</p>
<p>That the student may have it in his power to read the Patristic view of the matter, I give
a list of the passages most commonly cited, together with a review of the conciliar action,
for all which I am indebted to a masterly article by Wharton B. Marriott in Smith and
Cheetham’s Dictionary of Christian Antiquities (s.v. Usury).</p>
<p>Although the conditions of the mercantile community in the East and the West differed
materially in some respects, the fathers of the two churches are equally explicit and systematic
in their condemnation of the practice of usury. Among those belonging to the Greek
church we find Athanasius (Expos. in Ps. xiv); Basil the Great (Hom. in Ps. xiv). Gregory of
Nazianzum (Orat. xiv. in Patrem tacentem). Gregory of Nyssa (Orat. cont. Usurarios); Cyril
of Jerusalem (Catech. iv. c. 37), Epiphanius (adv. Hæres. Epilog. c. 24), Chrysostom (Hom.
xli. in Genes), and Theodoret (Interpr. in Ps. xiv. 5, and liv. 11). Among those belonging to
the Latin church, Hilary of Poitiers (in Ps. xiv); Ambrose (de Tobia liber unus). Jerome (in
Ezech. vi. 18); Augustine de Baptismo contr. Donatistas, iv. 19); Leo the Great (Epist. iii. 4),
and Cassiodorus (in Ps. xiv. 10).</p>
<p>The canons of later councils differ materially in relation to this subject, and indicate a
distinct tendency to mitigate the rigour of the Nicæan interdict. That of the council of
Carthage of the year 348 enforces the original prohibition, but without the penalty, and
grounds the veto on both Old and New Testament authority, “nemo contra prophetas, nemo
contra evangelia facit sine periculo” (Mansi, iii. 158). The language, however, when compared
with that of the council of Carthage of the year 419, serves to suggest that, in the interval,
the lower clergy had occasionally been found having recourse to the forbidden practice, for
<note type="footnote">99 Gury, Comp. Theol. Moral (Ed. Ballerini) vol. ii. p. 611.</note>

<pb n="104"/>
the general terms of the earlier canon, “ut non liceat clericis fenerari,” are enforced with
greater particularity in the latter, “Nec omnino cuiquam clericorum liceat de qualibet re
foenus accipere” (Mansi, iv. 423). This supposition is supported by the language of the
council of Orleans (a.d. 538), which appears to imply that deacons were not prohibited from
lending money at interest, “Et clericus a diaconatu, et supra, pecuniam non commodet ad
usuras” (ib. ix. 18). Similarly, at the second council of Trullanum (a.d. 692) a like liberty
would appear to have been recognised among the lower clergy (Hardouin, iii. 1663). While,
again, the Nicæan canon requires the immediate deposition of the ecclesiastic found guilty
of the practice, the Apostolical canon enjoins that such deposition is to take place only after
he has been admonished and has disregarded the admonition.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the evidence points to the conclusion that the Church imposed no
penalty on the layman. St. Basil (Epist. clxxxviii. can. 12), says that a usurer may even be
admitted to orders, provided he gives his acquired wealth to the poor and abstains for the
future from the pursuit of gain (Migne, Patrol. Græc. xxxii. 275). Gregory of Nyssa says
that usury, unlike theft, the desecration of tombs, and sacrilege (ἱεροσυλία ), is allowed to
pass unpunished, although among the things forbidden by Scripture, nor is a candidate at
ordination ever asked whether or no he has been guilty of the practice (Migne, ib. xlv. 233).
A letter of Sidonius Apollinaris (Epist. vi. 24) relating an experience of his friend Maximus,
appears to imply that no blame attached to lending money at the legal rate of interest, and
that even a bishop might be a creditor on those terms. We find also Desideratus, bishop of
Verdun, when applying for a loan to king Theodebert, for the relief of his impoverished
diocese, promising repayment, “cum usuris legitimis,” an expression which would seem to
imply that in the Gallican church usury was recognised as lawful under certain conditions
(Greg. Tur. Hist. Franc. iii. 34). So again a letter (Epist. ix. 38) of Gregory the Great seems
to shew that he did not regard the payment of interest for money advanced by one layman
to another as unlawful. But on the other hand, we find in what is known as archbishop
Theodore’s “Penitential” (circ. a.d. 690) what appears to be a general law on the subject,
enjoining “Sie quis usuras undecunque exegerit…tres annos in pane et aqua” (c. xxv. 3); a
penance again enjoined in the Penitential of Egbert of York (c. ii. 30). In like manner, the
legates, George and Theophylact, in reporting their proceedings in England to pope Adrian
I. (a.d. 787), state that they have prohibited “usurers,” and cite the authority of the Psalmist
and St. Augustine (Haddan and Stubbs, Conc. iii. 457). The councils of Mayence, Rheims,
and Châlons, in the year 813, and that of Aix in the year 816, seem to have laid down the
same prohibition as binding both on the clergy and the laity (Hardouin, Conc. iv. 1011,
1020, 1033, 1100).</p>
<p>Muratori, in his dissertation on the subject (Antichità, vol. i.), observes that “we do not
know exactly how commerce was transacted in the five preceding centuries,” and consequently
are ignorant as to the terms on which loans of money were effected.</p>

<head>Canon XVIII.</head>
<p>It has come to the knowledge of the holy and great Synod that, in some districts and
cities, the deacons administer the Eucharist to the presbyters, whereas neither canon nor
custom permits that they who have no right to offer should give the Body of Christ to them
that do offer. And this also has been made known, that certain deacons now touch the
Eucharist even before the bishops. Let all such practices be utterly done away, and let the
deacons remain within their own bounds, knowing that they are the ministers of the bishop
and the inferiors of the presbyters. Let them receive the Eucharist according to their order,
after the presbyters, and let either the bishop or the presbyter administer to them. Furthermore,
let not the deacons sit among the presbyters, for that is contrary to canon and order.
And if, after this decree, any one shall refuse to obey, let him be deposed from the diaconate.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.</p>
<p>Deacons must abide within their own bounds. They shall not administer the Eucharist
to presbyters, nor touch it before them, nor sit among the presbyters. For all this is contrary
to canon, and to decent order.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Four excesses of deacons this canon condemns, at least indirectly. The first was that
they gave the holy Communion to presbyters. To understand more easily the meaning of
the canon it must be remembered that the reference here is not to the presbyters who were
sacrificing at the altar but to those who were offering together with the bishop who was
sacrificing; by a rite not unlike that which to-day takes place, when the newly ordained
presbyters or bishops celebrate mass with the ordaining bishop; and this rite in old times
was of daily occurrence, for a full account of which see Morinus De SS. Ordinat. P. III. Exercit.
viij.…The present canon does not take away from deacons the authority to distribute
the Eucharist to laymen, or to the minor clergy, but only reproves their insolence and audacity
in presuming to administer to presbyters who were concelebrating with the bishop or another
presbyter.<gap reason="omitted"/></p>
<p>The second abuse was that certain deacons touched the sacred gifts before the bishop.
The vulgar version of Isidore reads for “touched” “received,” a meaning which Balsamon
and Zonaras also adopt, and unless the Greek word, which signifies “to touch,” is contrary
to this translation, it seems by no means to be alien to the context of the canon.</p>
<p>“Let them receive the Eucharist according to their order, after the presbyters, and let
the bishop or the presbyter administer to them.” In these words it is implied that some

<pb n="106"/>
deacons had presumed to receive Holy Communion before the presbyters, and this is the
third excess of the deacon which is condemned by the Synod.</p>
<p>And lastly, the fourth excess was that they took a place among the presbyters at the very
time of the sacrifice, or “at the holy altar,” as Balsamon observes.</p>
<p>From this canon we see that the Nicene fathers entertained no doubt that the faithful
in the holy Communion truly received “the body of Christ.” Secondly, that that was “offered”
in the church, which is the word by which sacrifice is designated in the New Testament, and
therefore it was at that time a fixed tradition that there was a sacrifice in which the body of
Christ was offered. Thirdly that not to all, nor even to deacons, but only to bishops and
presbyters was given the power of offering. And lastly, that there was recognized a fixed
hierarchy in the Church, made up of bishops and presbyters and deacons in subordination
to these.</p>
<p>Of course even at that early date there was nothing new in this doctrine of the Eucharist.
St. Ignatius more than a century and a half before, wrote as follows: “But mark ye those
who hold strange doctrine touching the grace of Jesus Christ which came to us, how that
they are contrary to the mind of God. They have no care for love, none for the widow, none
for the orphan, none for the afflicted, none for the prisoner, none for the hungry or thirsty.
They abstain from eucharist (thanksgiving) and prayer, because they allow not that the
Eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins, and which
the Father of his goodness raised up.”100</p>
<p>In one point the learned scholiast just quoted has most seriously understated his case.
He says that the wording of the canon shews “that the Nicene fathers entertained no doubt
that the faithful in the holy Communion truly received ‘the body of Christ.’” Now this
statement is of course true because it is included in what the canon says, but the doctrinal
statement which is necessarily contained in the canon is that “the body of Christ is given”
by the minister to the faithful. This doctrine is believed by all Catholics and by Lutherans,
but is denied by all other Protestants; those Calvinists who kept most nearly to the ordinary
Catholic phraseology only admitting that “the sacrament of the Body of Christ” was given
in the supper by the minister, while “the body of Christ,” they taught, was present only in
the soul of the worthy communicant (and in no way connected with the form of bread,
which was but the divinely appointed sign and assurance of the heavenly gift), and therefore
could not be “given” by the priest.101</p>

<p>Concerning the Paulianists who have flown for refuge to the Catholic Church, it has
been decreed that they must by all means be rebaptized; and if any of them who in past time
have been numbered among their clergy should be found blameless and without reproach,
let them be rebaptized and ordained by the Bishop of the Catholic Church; but if the examination
should discover them to be unfit, they ought to be deposed. Likewise in the case of
their deaconesses, and generally in the case of those who have been enrolled among their
clergy, let the same form be observed. And we mean by deaconesses such as have assumed
the habit, but who, since they have no imposition of hands, are to be numbered only among
the laity.</p>

<p>Paulianists must be rebaptised, and if such as are clergymen seem to be blameless let them
be ordained. If they do not seem to be blameless, let them be deposed. Deaconesses who have
been led astray, since they are not sharers of ordination, are to be reckoned among the laity.</p>

<p>That this is the true meaning of the phrase ὅρος ἐκτέθειται, viz. “a decree has now been
made,” is clear from the application of the words ὅρος in Canon xvii., and ὥρισεν, in Canon
vi. It has been a pure mistake, therefore, which Bp. Hefele blindly follows, to understand it
of some canon previously passed, whether at Arles or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Justellus.</p>
<p>Here χειροθεσία is taken for ordination or consecration, not for benediction,…for
neither were deaconesses, sub-deacons, readers, and other ministers ordained, but a blessing
was merely pronounced over them by prayer and imposition of hands.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>Their (the Paulicians’) deaconesses also, since they have no imposition of hands, if they
come over to the Catholic Church and are baptized, are ranked among the laity.</p>
<p>With this Zonaras and Balsamon also agree.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>

<pb n="108"/>
<p>By Paulianists must be understood the followers of Paul of Samosata the anti-Trinitarian
who, about the year 260, had been made bishop of Antioch, but had been deposed by a great
Synod in 269. As Paul of Samosata was heretical in his teaching on the Holy Trinity the
Synod of Nice applied to him the decree passed by the council of Arles in its eighth canon.
“If anyone shall come from heresy to the Church, they shall ask him to say the creed; and
if they shall perceive that he was baptized into the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost,102
he shall have a hand laid on him only that he may receive the Holy Ghost. But if in answer
to their questioning he shall not answer this Trinity, let him be baptized.”</p>
<p>The Samosatans, according to St. Athanasius, named the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
in administering baptism (Orat. ii, Contra Arian. No. xliii.), but as they gave a false meaning
to the baptismal formula and did not use the words Son and Holy Spirit in the usual sense,
the Council of Nice, like St. Athanasius himself, considered their baptism as invalid.</p>
<p>There is great difficulty about the text of the clause beginning “Likewise in the case,
etc.,” and Gelasius, the Prisca, Theilo and Thearistus, (who in 419 translated the canons of
Nice for the African bishops), the Pseudo-Isidore, and Gratian have all followed a reading
διακόνων, instead of διακονισσῶν. This change makes all clear, but many canonists keep
the ordinary text, including Van Espen, with whose interpretation Hefele does not agree.</p>
<p>The clause I have rendered “And we mean by deaconesses” is most difficult of translation.
I give the original, ᾽Εμνήσθημεν δὲ διακονισσῶν τῶν ἐν τῷ σχήματι ἐξετασθεισῶν,

of the clergy just mentioned.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Deaconess of the Early Church.</head>
<p>It has been supposed by many that the deaconess of the Early Church had an Apostolic
institution and that its existence may be referred to by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans
(xvi. 1) where he speaks of Phoebe as being a διάκονος of the Church of Cenchrea. It
moreover has been suggested that the “widows” of 1 Tim. v. 9 may have been deaconesses,
and this seems not unlikely from the fact that the age for the admission of women to this
ministry was fixed by Tertullian at sixty years (De Vel. Virg. Cap. ix.), and only changed to
forty, two centuries later by the Council of Chalcedon, and from the further fact that these
“widows” spoken of by St. Paul seem to have had a vow of chastity, for it is expressly said
that if they marry they have “damnation, because they have cast off their first faith” (1 Tim.
v. 12).</p>
<p>These women were called διακόνισσαι, πρεσβυτίδες (which must be distinguished from
the πρεσβυτέραι , a poor class referred to in the Apostolic Constitutions (ii. 28) who are to
be only invited frequently to the love-feasts, while the πρεσβυτίδες had a definite allotment
of the offerings assigned to their support), χῆραι, diaconissæ, presbyteræ, and viduæ.</p>
<p>The one great characteristic of the deaconess was that she was vowed to perpetual
chastity.103 The Apostolical Constitutions (vi. 17) say that she must be a chaste virgin
(παρθένος ἁγνὴ) or else a widow. The writer of the article “Deaconess” in the Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities says: “It is evident that the ordination of deaconesses included a
vow of celibacy.” We have already seen the language used by St. Paul and of this the wording
of the canon of Chalcedon is but an echo (Canon xv). “A woman shall not receive the laying
on of hands as a deaconess under forty years of age, and then only after searching examination.
And if, after she has had hands laid on her, and has continued for a time to minister,
she shall despise the Grace of God and give herself in marriage, she shall be anathematized
and the man who is united to her.” The civil law went still further, and by Justinian’s Sixth
<note type="footnote">103 In 1836, the Lutheran Pastor Fliedner, of a little town on the Rhine, opened a parish hospital the nurses
of which he called “Deaconesses.” This “Deaconess House” at Kaiserswerth, was the mother-house from which
all the deaconess establishments of the present day have taken their origin. The Methodists have adopted the
system successfully. Some efforts have been made to domesticate it, in a somewhat modified form, also in the
Anglican Churches but thus far with but little success. Of course these “Deaconesses” resemble the Deaconesses
of the Early Church only in name. The reader who may be interested in seeing an effort to connect the modern
deaconess with the deaconess of antiquity is referred to The Ministry of Deaconesses by Deaconess Cecilia
Robinson. This book, it should be said, contains much valuable and accurate information upon the subject, but
accepts as proven facts the suppositions of the late Bishop Lightfoot upon the subject; who somewhat rashly
asserted that “the female diaconate is as definite an institution as the male diaconate. Phoebe is as much a deacon
as Stephen or Philip is a deacon!”</note>

<pb n="110"/>
Novel (6) those who attempted to marry are subjected to forfeiture of property and capital
punishment. In the collect in the ancient office there is a special petition that the newly
admitted deaconess may have the gift of continence.</p>
<p>The principal work of the deaconess was to assist the female candidates for holy baptism.
At that time the sacrament of baptism was always administered by immersion (except to
those in extreme illness) and hence there was much that such an order of women could be
useful in. Moreover they sometimes gave to the female catechumens preliminary instruction,
but their work was wholly limited to women, and for a deaconess of the Early Church to
teach a man or to nurse him in sickness would have been an impossibility. The duties of
the deaconess are set forth in many ancient writings, I cite here what is commonly known
as the XII Canon of the Fourth Council of Carthage, which met in the year 398:</p>
<p>“Widows and dedicated women (sanctimoniales) who are chosen to assist at the baptism
of women, should be so well instructed in their office as to be able to teach aptly and properly
unskilled and rustic women how to answer at the time of their baptism to the questions put
to them, and also how to live godly after they have been baptized.” This whole matter is
treated clearly by St. Epiphanius who, while indeed speaking of deaconesses as an order
(τάγμα), asserts that “they were only women-elders, not priestesses in any sense, that their
mission was not to interfere in any way with Sacerdotal functions, but simply to perform
certain offices in the care of women” (Hær. lxxix., cap. iij). From all this it is evident that
they are entirely in error who suppose that “the laying on of hands” which the deaconesses
received corresponded to that by which persons were ordained to the diaconate, presbyterate,
and episcopate at that period of the church’s history. It was merely a solemn dedication
and blessing and was not looked upon as “an outward sign of an inward grace given.” For
further proof of this I must refer to Morinus, who has treated the matter most admirably.
(De Ordinationibus, Exercitatio X.)</p>
<p>The deaconesses existed but a short while. The council of Laodicea as early as a.d.
343–381, forbade the appointment of any who were called πρεσβύτιδες (Vide Canon xi);
and the first council of Orange, a.d. 441, in its twenty-sixth canon forbids the appointment
of deaconesses altogether, and the Second council of the same city in canons xvij and xviij,
decrees that deaconesses who married were to be excommunicated unless they renounced
the men they were living with, and that, on account of the weakness of the sex, none for the
future were to be ordained.</p>
<p>Thomassinus, to whom I refer the reader for a very full treatment of the whole subject,
is of opinion that the order was extinct in the West by the tenth or twelfth century, but that
it lingered on a little later at Constantinople but only in conventual institutions. (Thomassin,
Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l’ Eglise, I Partie, Livre III.)</p>

<p>Forasmuch as there are certain persons who kneel on the Lord’s Day and in the days of
Pentecost, therefore, to the intent that all things may be uniformly observed everywhere (in
every parish), it seems good to the holy Synod that prayer be made to God standing.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.</p>
<p>On Lord’s days and at Pentecost all must pray standing and not kneeling.
Hammond.</p>
<p>Although kneeling was the common posture for prayer in the primitive Church, yet the
custom had prevailed, even from the earliest times, of standing at prayer on the Lord’s day,
and during the fifty days between Easter and Pentecost. Tertullian, in a passage in his
treatise De Corona Militis, which is often quoted, mentions it amongst other observances
which, though not expressly commanded in Scripture, yet were universally practised upon
the authority of tradition. “We consider it unlawful,” he says, “to fast, or to pray kneeling,
upon the Lord’s day; we enjoy the same liberty from Easter-day to that of Pentecost.” De
Cor. Mil. s. 3, 4. Many other of the Fathers notice the same practice, the reason of which,
as given by Augustine and others, was to commemorate the resurrection of our Lord, and
to signify the rest and joy of our own resurrection, which that of our Lord assured. This
canon, as Beveridge observes, is a proof of the importance formerly attached to an uniformity
of sacred rites throughout the Church, which made the Nicene Fathers thus sanction and
enforce by their authority a practice which in itself is indifferent, and not commanded directly
or indirectly in Scripture, and assign this as their reason for doing so: “In order that all
things may be observed in like manner in every parish” or diocese.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>All the churches did not, however, adopt this practice; for we see in the Acts of the
Apostles (xx. 36 and xxi. 5) that St. Paul prayed kneeling during the time between Pentecost
and Easter.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Number of the Nicene Canons.</head>
<p>There has come down to us a Latin letter purporting to have been written by St. Athanasius
to Pope Marcus. This letter is found in the Benedictine edition of St. Athanasius’s
works (ed. Patav. ii. 599) but rejected as spurious by Montfaucon the learned editor. In this
letter is contained the marvellous assertion that the Council of Nice at first adopted forty
canons, which were in Greek, that it subsequently added twenty Latin canons, and that afterwards
the council reassembled and set forth seventy altogether. A tradition that something
of the kind had taken place was prevalent in parts of the East, and some collections did
contain seventy canons.</p>
<p>In the Vatican Library is a ms. which was bought for it by the famous Asseman, from
the Coptic Patriarch, John, and which contains not only seventy, but eighty canons attributed
to the council of Nice. The ms. is in Arabic, and was discovered by J. B. Romanus, S. J., who
first made its contents known, and translated into Latin a copy he had made of it. Another
Jesuit, Pisanus, was writing a history of the Nicene Council at the time and he received the
eighty newly found canons into his book; but, out of respect to the pseudo-Athanasian letter,
he at first cut down the number to seventy; but in later editions he followed the ms. All this
was in the latter half of the sixteenth century; and in 1578 Turrianus, who had had Father
Romanus’s translation revised before it was first published, now issued an entirely new
translation with a Proëmium104 containing a vast amount of information upon the whole
subject, and setting up an attempted proof that the number of the Nicene Canons exceeded
twenty. His argument for the time being carried the day.</p>
<p>Hefele says, “it is certain that the Orientals105 believed the Council of Nice to have
promulgated more than twenty canons: the learned Anglican, Beveridge,106 has proved
this, reproducing an ancient Arabic paraphrase of the canons of the first four Ecumenical
Councils. According to this Arabic paraphrase, found in a ms. in the Bodleian Library, the
Council of Nice must have put forth three books of canons.<gap reason="omitted"/>The Arabic paraphrase of
which we are speaking gives a paraphrase of all these canons, but Beveridge took only the
part referring to the second book—that is to say, the paraphrase of the twenty genuine
canons; for, according to his view, which was perfectly correct, it was only these twenty
canons which were really the work of the Council of Nice, and all the others were falsely
attributed to it.”107</p>
<note type="footnote">104 Vide Labbe, Conc. ii. 287.</note>
<note type="footnote">105 Who exactly these Orientals were Hefele does not specify, but Ffoulkes well points out (Dict. Christ. Antiq.

<p>Hefele goes on to prove that the canons he rejects must be of much later origin, some
being laws of the times of Theodosius and Justinian according to the opinion of Renaudot.108</p>
<p>Before leaving this point I should notice the profound research on these Arabic canons
of the Maronite, Abraham Echellensis. He gives eighty-four canons in his Latin translation
of 1645, and was of opinion that they had been collected from different Oriental sources,
and sects; but that originally they had all been translated from the Greek, and were collected
by James, the celebrated bishop of Nisibis, who was present at Nice. But this last supposition
is utterly untenable.</p>
<p>Among the learned there have not been wanting some who have held that the Council
of Nice passed more canons than the twenty we possess, and have arrived at the conclusion
independently of the Arabic discovery, such are Baronius and Card. d’Aguirre, but their
arguments have been sufficiently answered, and they cannot present anything able to
weaken the conclusion that flows from the consideration of the following facts.</p>
<p>(Hefele: History of the Councils, Vol. I. pp. 355 et seqq. <del>2d ed.</del>)</p>
<p>Let us see first what is the testimony of those Greek and Latin authors who lived about
the time of the Council, concerning the number.</p>
<p>a. The first to be consulted among the Greek authors is the learned Theodoret, who
lived about a century after the Council of Nicæa. He says, in his History of the Church:
“After the condemnation of the Arians, the bishops assembled once more, and decreed
twenty canons on ecclesiastical discipline.”</p>
<p>b. Twenty years later, Gelasius, Bishop of Cyzicus, after much research into the most
ancient documents, wrote a history of the Nicene Council. Gelasius also says expressly that
the Council decreed twenty canons; and, what is more important, he gives the original text
of these canons exactly in the same order, and according to the tenor which we find elsewhere.
c. Rufinus is more ancient than these two historians. He was born near the period when
the Council of Nicæa was held, and about half a century after he wrote his celebrated history
of the Church, in which he inserted a Latin translation of the Nicene canons. Rufinus also
knew only of these twenty canons; but as he has divided the sixth and the eighth into two
parts, he has given twenty-two canons, which are exactly the same as the twenty furnished
by the other historians.</p>
<p>d. The famous discussion between the African bishops and the Bishop of Rome, on the
subject of appeals to Rome, gives us a very important testimony on the true number of the
Nicene canons. The presbyter Apiarius of Sicca in Africa, having been deposed for many
crimes, appealed to Rome. Pope Zosimus (417–418) took the appeal into consideration,
sent legates to Africa; and to prove that he had the right to act thus, he quoted a canon of
<note type="footnote">108 Renaudot: Hist. Patriarcharum Alexandrianorum Jacobitarum. Paris, 1713, p. 75.</note>

<pb n="114"/>
the Council of Nicæa, containing these words: “When a bishop thinks he has been unjustly
deposed by his colleagues he may appeal to Rome, and the Roman bishop shall have the
business decided by judices in partibus.” The canon quoted by the Pope does not belong to
the Council of Nicæa, as he affirmed; it was the fifth canon of the Council of Sardica (the
seventh in the Latin version). What explains the error of Zosimus is that in the ancient
copies the canons of Nicæa and Sardica are written consecutively, with the same figures,
and under the common title of canons of the Council of Nicæa; and Zosimus might optima
fide fall into an error—which he shared with Greek authors, his contemporaries, who also
mixed the canons of Nicæa with those of Sardica. The African bishops, not finding the
canon quoted by the Pope either in their Greek or in their Latin copies, in vain consulted
also the copy which Bishop Cecilian, who had himself been present at the Council of Nicæa,
had brought to Carthage. The legates of the Pope then declared that they did not rely upon
these copies, and they agreed to send to Alexandria and to Constantinople to ask the patriarchs
of these two cities for authentic copies of the canons of the Council of Nicæa. The
African bishops desired in their turn that Pope Boniface should take the same step (Pope
Zosimus had died meanwhile in 418)—that he should ask for copies from the Archbishops
of Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. Cyril of Alexandria and Atticus of Constantinople,
indeed, sent exact and faithful copies of the Creed and canons of Nicæa; and
two learned men of Constantinople, Theilo and Thearistus, even translated these canons
into Latin. Their translation has been preserved to us in the acts of the sixth Council of
Carthage, and it contains only the twenty ordinary canons. It might be thought at first sight
that it contained twenty-one canons; but on closer consideration we see, as Hardouin has
proved, that this twenty-first article is nothing but an historical notice appended to the
Nicene canons by the Fathers of Carthage. It is conceived in these terms: “After the bishops
had decreed these rules at Nicæa, and after the holy Council had decided what was the ancient
rule for the celebration of Easter, peace and unity of faith were re-established between the
East and the West. This is what we (the African bishops) have thought it right to add according
to the history of the Church.”</p>
<p>The bishops of Africa despatched to Pope Boniface the copies which had been sent to
them from Alexandria and Constantinople, in the month of November 419; and subsequently
in their letters to Celestine I. (423–432), successor to Boniface, they appealed to the text of
these documents.</p>
<p>e. All the ancient collections of canons, either in Latin or Greek, composed in the fourth,
or quite certainly at least in the fifth century, agree in giving only these twenty canons to
Nicæa. The most ancient of these collections were made in the Greek Church, and in the
course of time a very great number of copies of them were written. Many of these copies
have descended to us; many libraries possess copies; thus Montfaucon enumerates several
in his Bibliotheca Coisliniana. Fabricius makes a similar catalogue of the copies in his Bib-

<pb n="115"/>
liotheca Græca to those found in the libraries of Turin, Florence, Venice, Oxford, Moscow,
etc.; and he adds that these copies also contain the so-called apostolic canons, and those of
the most ancient councils. The French bishop John Tilius presented to Paris, in 1540, a ms.
of one of these Greek collections as it existed in the ninth century. It contains exactly our
twenty canons of Nicæa, besides the so-called apostolic canons, those of Ancyra, etc. Elias
Ehmger published a new edition at Wittemberg in 1614, using a second ms. which was
found at Augsburg; but the Roman collection of the Councils had before given in 1608, the
Greek text of the twenty canons of Nicæa. This text of the Roman editors, with the exception
of some insignificant variations, was exactly the same as that of the edition of Tilius. Neither
the learned Jesuit Sirmond nor his coadjutors have mentioned what manuscripts were
consulted in preparing this edition; probably they were manuscripts drawn from several
libraries, and particularly from that of the Vatican. The text of this Roman edition passed
into all the following collections, even into those of Hardouin and Mansi; while Justell in
his Bibliotheca juris Canonici and Beveridge in his Synodicon (both of the eighteenth century),
give a somewhat different text, also collated from mss., and very similar to the text given by
Tilius. Bruns, in his recent Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica, compares the two texts. Now all these
Greek mss., consulted at such different times, and by all these editors, acknowledge only
twenty canons of Nicæa, and always the same twenty which we possess.</p>
<p>The Latin collections of the canons of the Councils also give the same result—for example,
the most ancient and the most remarkable of all, the Prisca, and that of Dionysius
the Less, which was collected about the year 500. The testimony of this latter collection is
the more important for the number twenty, as Dionysius refers to the Græca auctoritas.</p>
<p>f. Among the later Eastern witnesses we may further mention Photius, Zonaras and
Balsamon. Photius, in his Collection of the Canons, and in his Nomocanon, as well as the
two other writers in their commentaries upon the canons of the ancient Councils, quote
only and know only twenty canons of Nicæa, and always those which we possess.</p>
<p>g. The Latin canonists of the Middle Ages also acknowledge only these twenty canons
of Nicæa. We have proof of this in the celebrated Spanish collection, which is generally but
erroneously attributed to St. Isidore (it was composed at the commencement of the seventh
century), and in that of Adrian (so called because it was offered to Charles the Great by Pope
Adrian I). The celebrated Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, the first canonist of the ninth
century, in his turn attributes only twenty canons to the Council of Nicæa, and even the
pseudo-Isidore assigns it no more.</p>

change it, and order it, as seemeth him fit: for he is the father of all, and they are his sons.
And although the archbishop be among the bishops as an elder brother, who hath the care
of his brethren, and to whom they owe obedience because he is over them; yet the patriarch
is to all those who are under his power, just as he who holds the seat of Rome, is the head
and prince of all patriarchs; inasmuch as he is first, as was Peter, to whom power is given
over all Christian princes, and over all their peoples, as he who is the Vicar of Christ our
Lord over all peoples and over the whole Christian Church, and whoever shall contradict
this, is excommunicated by the Synod.111</p>

lord of the great Alexandria, which is the see of Mark. And the third is the lord of Ephesus,
which is the see of John the Divine who speaks divine things. And the fourth and last is my
lord of Antioch, which is another see of Peter. And let all the bishops be divided under the
hands of these four patriarchs; and the bishops of the little towns which are under the
dominion of the great cities let them be under the authority of these metropolitans. But let
every metropolitan of these great cities appoint the bishops of his province, but let none of
the bishops appoint him, for he is greater than they. Therefore let every man know his own
rank, and let him not usurp the rank of another. And whosoever shall contradict this law

he turns her out of doors, the matter must be diligently examined; and if the accusation was
false, he shall be deposed if a cleric, but if a layman shall be prohibited from entering the
church and from the communion of the faithful; and shall be compelled to live with her
whom he has defamed, even though she be deformed, and poor, and insane; and whoever
shall not obey is excommunicated by the Synod.</p>
<p><del>Note.—The reader will notice that by this canon a husband is deposed or excommunicated,
as the case may be, if he marry another woman, after putting away his wife on account
of her adultery. It is curious that in the parallel canon in the collection of Echellensis, which
is numbered LXXI., the reading is quite different, although it is very awkward and inconsequent
as given. Moreover, it should be remembered that in some codices and editions
this canon is lacking altogether, one on the right of the Pope to receive appeals taking its
place. As this canon is of considerable length, I only quote the interesting parts.</del></p>
<p>Whatever presbyter or deacon shall put away his wife without the offence of fornica
tion, or for any other cause of which we have spoken above, and shall cast her out of
doors…such a person shall be cast out of the clergy, if he were a clergyman; if a layman he
shall be forbidden the communion of the faithful.…But if that woman [untruly charged by
her husband with adultery], that is to say his wife, spurns his society on account of the injury
he has done her and the charge he has brought against her, of which she is innocent, let her
freely be put away and let a bill of repudiation be written for her, noting the false accusation
which had been brought against her. And then if she should wish to marry some other
faithful man, it is right for her to do so, nor does the Church forbid it; and the same permission
extends as well to men as to women, since there is equal reason for it for each. But if
he shall return to better fruit which is of the same kind, and shall conciliate to himself the
love and benevolence of his consort, and shall be willing to return to his pristine friendship,
his fault shall be condoned to him after he has done suitable and sufficient penance. And
whoever shall speak against this decree the fathers of the synod excommunicate him.</p>

<head>Proposed Action on Clerical Celibacy.</head>
<p><del>The Acts are not extant.</del></p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Often the mind of a deliberative assembly is as clearly shown by the propositions it rejects
as by those it adopts, and it would seem that this doctrine is of application in the case of the
asserted attempt at this Council to pass a decree forbidding the priesthood to live in the use
of marriage. This attempt is said to have failed. The particulars are as follows:</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>(Hist. Councils, Vol. I., pp. 435 et seqq.)</p>
<p>Socrates, Sozomen, and Gelasius affirm that the Synod of Nicæa, as well as that of Elvira
(can. 33), desired to pass a law respecting celibacy. This law was to forbid all bishops, priests
and deacons (Sozomen adds subdeacons), who were married at the time of their ordination,
to continue to live with their wives. But, say these historians, the law was opposed openly
and decidedly by Paphnutius, bishop of a city of the Upper Thebaïs in Egypt, a man of a
high reputation, who had lost an eye during the persecution under Maximian. He was also
celebrated for his miracles, and was held in so great respect by the Emperor, that the latter
often kissed the empty socket of the lost eye. Paphnutius declared with a loud voice, “that
too heavy a yoke ought not to be laid upon the clergy; that marriage and married intercourse
are of themselves honourable and undefiled; that the Church ought not to be injured by an
extreme severity, for all could not live in absolute continency: in this way (by not prohibiting
married intercourse) the virtue of the wife would be much more certainly preserved (viz.
the wife of a clergyman, because she might find injury elsewhere, if her husband withdrew
from her married intercourse). The intercourse of a man with his lawful wife may also be
a chaste intercourse. It would therefore be sufficient, according to the ancient tradition of
the Church, if those who had taken holy orders without being married were prohibited from
marrying afterwards; but those clergymen who had been married only once as laymen, were
not to be separated from their wives (Gelasius adds, or being only a reader or cantor).” This
discourse of Paphnutius made so much the more impression, because he had never lived
in matrimony himself, and had had no conjugal intercourse. Paphnutius, indeed, had been
brought up in a monastery, and his great purity of manners had rendered him especially
celebrated. Therefore the Council took the serious words of the Egyptian bishop into consideration,
stopped all discussion upon the law, and left to each cleric the responsibility of
deciding the point as he would.</p>

<pb n="129"/>
<p>If this account be true, we must conclude that a law was proposed to the Council of
Nicæa the same as one which had been carried twenty years previously at Elvira, in Spain;
this coincidence would lead us to believe that it was the Spaniard Hosius who proposed the
law respecting celibacy at Nicæa. The discourse ascribed to Paphnutius, and the consequent
decision of the Synod, agree very well with the text of the Apostolic Constitutions, and with
the whole practice of the Greek Church in respect to celibacy. The Greek Church as well
as the Latin accepted the principle, that whoever had taken holy orders before marriage,
ought not to be married afterwards. In the Latin Church, bishops, priests, deacons. and
even subdeacons, were considered to be subject to this law, because the latter were at a very
early period reckoned among the higher servants of the Church, which was not the case in
the Greek Church. The Greek Church went so far as to allow deacons to marry after their
ordination, if previously to it they had expressly obtained from their bishop permission to
do so. The Council of Ancyra affirms this (c. 10). We see that the Greek Church wishes to
leave the bishop free to decide the matter; but in reference to priests, it also prohibited them
from marrying after their ordination. Therefore, whilst the Latin Church exacted of those
presenting themselves for ordination, even as subdeacons, that they should not continue to
live with their wives if they were married, the Greek Church gave no such prohibition; but
if the wife of an ordained clergyman died, the Greek Church allowed no second marriage.
The Apostolic Constitutions decided this point in the same way. To leave their wives from
a pretext of piety was also forbidden to Greek priests; and the Synod of Gangra (c. 4) took
up the defence of married priests against the Eustathians. Eustathius, however, was not
alone among the Greeks in opposing the marriage of all clerics, and in desiring to introduce
into the Greek Church the Latin discipline on this point. St. Epiphanius also inclined towards
this side. The Greek Church did not, however, adopt this rigour in reference to priests,
deacons, and subdeacons, but by degrees it came to be required of bishops and of the higher
order of clergy in general, that they should live in celibacy. Yet this was not until after the
compilation of the Apostolic Canons (c. 5) and of the Constitutions; for in those documents
mention is made of bishops living in wedlock, and Church history shows that there were
married bishops, for instance Synesius, in the fifth century. But it is fair to remark, even as
to Synesius, that he made it an express condition of his acceptation, on his election to the
episcopate, that he might continue to live the married life. Thomassin believes that Synesius
did not seriously require this condition, and only spoke thus for the sake of escaping the
episcopal office; which would seem to imply that in his time Greek bishops had already begun
to live in celibacy. At the Trullan Synod (c. 13.) the Greek Church finally settled the question
of the marriage of priests. Baronius, Valesius, and other historians, have considered the
account of the part taken by Paphnutius to be apocryphal. Baronius says, that as the
Council of Nicæa in its third canon gave a law upon celibacy it is quite impossible to admit
that it would alter such a law on account of Paphnutius. But Baronius is mistaken in seeing

<pb n="130"/>
a law upon celibacy in that third canon; he thought it to be so, because, when mentioning
the women who might live in the clergyman’s house—his mother, sister, etc.—the canon
does not say a word about the wife. It had no occasion to mention her, it was referring to
the συνεισάκτοι whilst these συνεισάκτοι and married women have nothing in common.
Natalis Alexander gives this anecdote about Paphnutius in full: he desired to refute Ballarmin,
who considered it to be untrue and an invention of Socrates to please the Novatians. Natalis
Alexander often maintains erroneous opinions, and on the present question he deserves no
confidence. If, as St. Epiphanius relates, the Novatians maintained that the clergy might be
married exactly like the laity, it cannot be said that Socrates shared that opinion, since he
says, or rather makes Paphnutius say, that, according to ancient tradition, those not married
at the time of ordination should not be so subsequently. Moreover, if it may be said that
Socrates had a partial sympathy with the Novatians, he certainly cannot be considered as
belonging to them, still less can he be accused of falsifying history in their favour. He may
sometimes have propounded erroneous opinions, but there is a great difference between
that and the invention of a whole story. Valesius especially makes use of the argument ex
silentio against Socrates. (a) Rufinus, he says, gives many particulars about Paphnutius in
his History of the Church; he mentions his martyrdom, his miracles, and the Emperor’s
reverence for him, but not a single word of the business about celibacy. (b) The name of
Paphnutius is wanting in the list of Egyptian bishops present at the Synod. These two arguments
of Valesius are weak; the second has the authority of Rufinus himself against it, who
expressly says that Bishop Paphnutius was present at the Council of Nicæa. If Valesius
means by lists only the signatures at the end of the acts of the Council, this proves nothing;
for these lists are very imperfect, and it is well known that many bishops whose names are
not among these signatures were present at Nicæa. This argument ex silentio is evidently
insufficient to prove that the anecdote about Paphnutius must be rejected as false, seeing
that it is in perfect harmony with the practice of the ancient Church, and especially of the
Greek Church, on the subject of clerical marriages. On the other hand, Thomassin pretends
that there was no such practice, and endeavours to prove by quotations from St. Epiphanius,
St. Jerome, Eusebius, and St. John Chrysostom, that even in the East priests who were married
at the time of their ordination were prohibited from continuing to live with their wives.
The texts quoted by Thomassin prove only that the Greeks gave especial honour to priests
living in perfect continency, but they do not prove that this continence was a duty incumbent
upon all priests; and so much the less, as the fifth and twenty-fifth Apostolic canons, the
fourth canon of Gangra, and the thirteenth of the Trullan Synod, demonstrate clearly enough
what was the universal custom of the Greek Church on this point. Lupus and Phillips explained
the words of Paphnutius in another sense. According to them, the Egyptian bishop
was not speaking in a general way; he simply desired that the contemplated law should not
include the subdeacons. But this explanation does not agree with the extracts quoted from

well.</p>

<head>The Synodal Letter.</head>
<p>(Found in Gelasius, Historia Concilii Nicæni, lib. II, cap. xxxiii.; Socr., H. E., lib. I., cap.
6; Theodor., H. E., Lib. I., cap. 9.)</p>
<p>To the Church of Alexandria, by the grace of God, holy and great; and to our well-beloved
brethren, the orthodox clergy and laity throughout Egypt, and Pentapolis, and Lybia, and
every nation under heaven, the holy and great synod, the bishops assembled at Nicea, wish
health in the Lord.</p>
<p>Forasmuch as the great and holy Synod, which was assembled at Niece through the
grace of Christ and our most religious Sovereign Constantine, who brought us together
from our several provinces and cities, has considered matters which concern the faith of
the Church, it seemed to us to be necessary that certain things should be communicated
from us to you in writing, so that you might have the means of knowing what has been
mooted and investigated, and also what has been decreed and confirmed.</p>
<p>First of all, then, in the presence of our most religious Sovereign Constantine, investigation
was made of matters concerning the impiety and transgression of Arius and his adherents;
and it was unanimously decreed that he and his impious opinion should be anathematized,
together with the blasphemous words and speculations in which he indulged, blaspheming
the Son of God, and saying that he is from things that are not, and that before he
was begotten he was not, and that there was a time when he was not, and that the Son of
God is by his free will capable of vice and virtue; saying also that he is a creature. All these
things the holy Synod has anathematized, not even enduring to hear his impious doctrine
and madness and blasphemous words. And of the charges against him and of the results
they had, ye have either already heard or will hear the particulars, lest we should seem to be
oppressing a man who has in fact received a fitting recompense for his own sin. So far indeed
has his impiety prevailed, that he has even destroyed Theonas of Marmorica and Secundes
of Ptolemais; for they also have received the same sentence as the rest.</p>
<p>But when the grace of God had delivered Egypt from that heresy and blasphemy, and
from the persons who have dared to make disturbance and division among a people heretofore
at peace, there remained the matter of the insolence of Meletius and those who have
been ordained by him; and concerning this part of our work we now, beloved brethren,
proceed to inform you of the decrees of the Synod. The Synod, then, being disposed to deal
gently with Meletius (for in strict justice he deserved no leniency), decreed that he should
remain in his own city, but have no authority either to ordain, or to administer affairs, or
to make appointments; and that he should not appear in the country or in any other city
for this purpose, but should enjoy the bare title of his rank; but that those who have been
placed by him, after they have been confirmed by a more sacred laying on of hands, shall
on these conditions be admitted to communion: that they shall both have their rank and

<pb n="133"/>
the right to officiate, but that they shall be altogether the inferiors of all those who are enrolled
in any church or parish, and have been appointed by our most honourable colleague Alexander.
So that these men are to have no authority to make appointments of persons who
may be pleasing to them, nor to suggest names, nor to do anything whatever, without the
consent of the bishops of the Catholic and Apostolic Church, who are serving under our
most holy colleague Alexander; while those who, by the grace of God and through your
prayers, have been found in no schism, but on the contrary are without spot in the Catholic
and Apostolic Church, are to have authority to make appointments and nominations of
worthy persons among the clergy, and in short to do all things according to the law and
ordinance of the Church. But, if it happen that any of the clergy who are now in the Church
should die, then those who have been lately received are to succeed to the office of the deceased;
always provided that they shall appear to be worthy, and that the people elect them,
and that the bishop of Alexandria shall concur in the election and ratify it. This concession
has been made to all the rest; but, on account of his disorderly conduct from the first, and
the rashness and precipitation of his character, the same decree was not made concerning
Meletius himself, but that, inasmuch as he is a man capable of committing again the same
disorders, no authority nor privilege should be conceded to him.</p>
<p>These are the particulars, which are of special interest to Egypt and to the most holy
Church of Alexandria; but if in the presence of our most honoured lord, our colleague and
brother Alexander, anything else has been enacted by canon or other decree, he will himself
convey it to you in greater detail, he having been both a guide and fellow-worker in what
has been done.</p>
<p>We further proclaim to you the good news of the agreement concerning the holy Easter,
that this particular also has through your prayers been rightly settled; so that all our brethren
in the East who formerly followed the custom of the Jews are henceforth to celebrate the
said most sacred feast of Easter at the same time with the Romans and yourselves and all
those who have observed Easter from the beginning.</p>
<p>Wherefore, rejoicing in these wholesome results, and in our common peace and harmony,
and in the cutting off of every heresy, receive ye with the greater honour and with
increased love, our colleague your Bishop Alexander, who has gladdened us by his presence,
and who at so great an age has undergone so great fatigue that peace might be established
among you and all of us. Pray ye also for us all, that the things which have been deemed
advisable may stand fast; for they have been done, as we believe, to the well-pleasing of
Almighty God and of his only Begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost,
to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>On the Keeping of Easter.</head>
<p>From the Letter of the Emperor to all those not present at the Council.</p>
<p>(Found in Eusebius, Vita Const., Lib. iii., 18–20.)</p>
<p>When the question relative to the sacred festival of Easter arose, it was universally
thought that it would be convenient that all should keep the feast on one day; for what could
be more beautiful and more desirable, than to see this festival, through which we receive
the hope of immortality, celebrated by all with one accord, and in the same manner? It was
declared to be particularly unworthy for this, the holiest of all festivals, to follow the custom
[the calculation] of the Jews, who had soiled their hands with the most fearful of crimes,
and whose minds were blinded. In rejecting their custom,113 we may transmit to our descendants
the legitimate mode of celebrating Easter, which we have observed from the time
of the Saviour’s Passion to the present day [according to the day of the week]. We ought
not, therefore, to have anything in common with the Jews, for the Saviour has shown us
another way; our worship follows a more legitimate and more convenient course (the order
of the days of the week); and consequently, in unanimously adopting this mode, we desire,
dearest brethren, to separate ourselves from the detestable company of the Jews, for it is
truly shameful for us to hear them boast that without their direction we could not keep this
feast. How can they be in the right, they who, after the death of the Saviour, have no longer
been led by reason but by wild violence, as their delusion may urge them? They do not
possess the truth in this Easter question; for, in their blindness and repugnance to all improvements,
they frequently celebrate two passovers in the same year. We could not imitate
those who are openly in error. How, then, could we follow these Jews, who are most certainly
blinded by error? for to celebrate the passover twice in one year is totally inadmissible. But
even if this were not so, it would still be your duty not to tarnish your soul by communications
with such wicked people [the Jews]. Besides, consider well, that in such an important matter,
and on a subject of such great solemnity, there ought not to be any division. Our Saviour
has left us only one festal day of our redemption, that is to say, of his holy passion, and he
desired [to establish] only one Catholic Church. Think, then, how unseemly it is, that on
the same day some should be fasting whilst others are seated at a banquet; and that after
Easter, some should be rejoicing at feasts, whilst others are still observing a strict fast. For
this reason, a Divine Providence wills that this custom should be rectified and regulated in
a uniform way; and everyone, I hope, will agree upon this point. As, on the one hand, it is
our duty not to have anything in common with the murderers of our Lord; and as, on the
<note type="footnote">113 We must read ἕθους, not ἔθνους, as the Mayence impression of the edition of Valerius has it.</note>

<pb n="135"/>
other, the custom now followed by the Churches of the West, of the South, and of the North,
and by some of those of the East, is the most acceptable, it has appeared good to all; and I
have been guarantee for your consent, that you would accept it with joy, as it is followed at
Rome, in Africa, in all Italy, Egypt, Spain, Gaul, Britain, Libya, in all Achaia, and in the
dioceses of Asia, of Pontus, and Cilicia. You should consider not only that the number of
churches in these provinces make a majority, but also that it is right to demand what our
reason approves, and that we should have nothing in common with the Jews. To sum up
in few words: By the unanimous judgment of all, it has been decided that the most holy
festival of Easter should be everywhere celebrated on one and the same day, and it is not
seemly that in so holy a thing there should be any division. As this is the state of the case,
accept joyfully the divine favour, and this truly divine command; for all which takes place
in assemblies of the bishops ought to be regarded as proceeding from the will of God. Make
known to your brethren what has been decreed, keep this most holy day according to the
prescribed mode; we can thus celebrate this holy Easter day at the same time, if it is granted
me, as I desire, to unite myself with you; we can rejoice together, seeing that the divine power
has made use of our instrumentality for destroying the evil designs of the devil, and thus
causing faith, peace, and unity to flourish amongst us. May God graciously protect you, my
beloved brethren.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Subsequent History of the Easter Question.</head>
<p>(Hefele: Hist. of the Councils, Vol. I., pp. 328 et seqq.)</p>
<p>The differences in the way of fixing the period of Easter did not indeed disappear after
the Council of Nicea. Alexandria and Rome could not agree, either because one of the two
Churches neglected to make the calculation for Easter, or because the other considered it
inaccurate. It is a fact, proved by the ancient Easter table of the Roman Church, that the
cycle of eighty-four years continued to be used at Rome as before. Now this cycle differed
in many ways from the Alexandrian, and did not always agree with it about the period for
Easter—in fact (a), the Romans used quite another method from the Alexandrians; they
calculated from the epact, and began from the feria prima of January. (b.) The Romans
were mistaken in placing the full moon a little too soon; whilst the Alexandrians placed it
a little too late. (c.) At Rome the equinox was supposed to fall on March 18th; whilst the
Alexandrians placed it on March 21st. (d.) Finally, the Romans differed in this from the
Greeks also; they did not celebrate Easter the next day when the full moon fell on the Saturday.</p>
<p>Even the year following the Council of Nicea—that is, in 326—as well as in the years
330, 333, 340, 341, 343, the Latins celebrated Easter on a different day from the Alexandrians.
In order to put an end to this misunderstanding, the Synod of Sardica in 343, as we learn
from the newly discovered festival letters of S. Athanasius, took up again the question of
Easter, and brought the two parties (Alexandrians and Romans) to regulate, by means of
mutual concessions, a common day for Easter for the next fifty years. This compromise,
after a few years, was not observed. The troubles excited by the Arian heresy, and the division
which it caused between the East and the West, prevented the decree of Sardica from being
put into execution; therefore the Emperor Theodosius the Great, after the re-establishment
of peace in the Church, found himself obliged to take fresh steps for obtaining a complete
uniformity in the manner of celebrating Easter. In 387, the Romans having kept Easter on
March 21st, the Alexandrians did not do so for five weeks later—that is to say, till April
25th—because with the Alexandrians the equinox was not till March 21st. The Emperor
Theodosius the Great then asked Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria for an explanation of
the difference. The bishop responded to the Emperor’s desire, and drew up a chronological
table of the Easter festivals, based upon the principles acknowledged by the Church of Alexandria.
Unfortunately, we now possess only the prologue of his work.</p>
<p>Upon an invitation from Rome, S. Ambrose also mentioned the period of this same
Easter in 387, in his letter to the bishops of Æmilia, and he sides with the Alexandrian
computation. Cyril of Alexandria abridged the paschal table of his uncle Theophilus, and
fixed the time for the ninety-five following Easters—that is, from 436 to 531 after Christ.
Besides this Cyril showed, in a letter to the Pope, what was defective in the Latin calculation;

<pb n="137"/>
and this demonstration was taken up again, some time after, by order of the Emperor, by
Paschasinus, Bishop of Lilybæum and Proterius of Alexandria, in a letter written by them
to Pope Leo I. In consequence of these communications, Pope Leo often gave the preference
to the Alexandrian computation, instead of that of the Church of Rome. At the same time
also was generally established, the opinion so little entertained by the ancient authorities of
the Church—one might even say, so strongly in contradiction to their teaching—that Christ
partook of the passover on the 14th Nisan, that he died on the 15th (not on the 14th, as the
ancients considered), that he lay in the grave on the 16th, and rose again on the 17th. In
the letter we have just mentioned, Proterius of Alexandria openly admitted all these different
points.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards, in 457, Victor of Aquitane, by order of the Roman Archdeacon
Hilary, endeavoured to make the Roman and the Alexandrian calculations agree together.
It has been conjectured that subsequently Hilary, when Pope, brought Victor’s calculation
into use, in 456—that is, at the time when the cycle of eighty-four years came to an end. In
the latter cycle the new moons were marked more accurately, and the chief differences existing
between the Latin and Greek calculations disappeared; so that the Easter of the Latins
generally coincided with that of Alexandria, or was only a very little removed from it. In
cases when the ιδ' fell on a Saturday, Victor did not wish to decide whether Easter should
be celebrated the next day, as the Alexandrians did, or should be postponed for a week. He
indicates both dates in his table, and leaves the Pope to decide what was to be done in each
separate case. Even after Victor’s calculations, there still remained great differences in the
manner of fixing the celebration of Easter; and it was Dionysius the Less who first completely
overcame them, by giving to the Latins a paschal table having as its basis the cycle of nineteen
years. This cycle perfectly corresponded to that of Alexandria, and thus established that
harmony which had been so long sought in vain. He showed the advantages of his calculation
so strongly, that it was admitted by Rome and by the whole of Italy; whilst almost the whole
of Gaul remained faithful to Victor’s canon, and Great Britain still held the cycle of eightyfour
years, a little improved by Sulpicius Severus. When the Heptarchy was evangelized by
the Roman missionaries, the new converts accepted the calculation of Dionysius, whilst the
ancient Churches of Wales held fast their old tradition. From this arose the well-known
British dissensions about the celebration of Easter, which were transplanted by Columban
into Gaul. In 729, the majority of the ancient British Churches accepted the cycle of nineteen
years. It had before been introduced into Spain, immediately after the conversion of Reccared.
Finally, under Charles the Great, the cycle of nineteen years triumphed over all opposition;
and thus the whole of Christendom was united, for the Quartodecimans had
gradually disappeared.114</p>

<head>Introductory Note to the Canons of the Provincial Synods which in
this Volume are Interjected Between the First and the Second Ecumenical
Councils.</head>
<p>The First Canon of the Fourth Ecumenical Council, Chalcedon, reads as follows: “We
have judged it right that the canons of the Holy Fathers made in every synod even until
now, should remain in force.” And the Council in Trullo, in its second canon, has enumerated
these synods in the following words. “We set our seal to all the rest of the canons which
have been established by our holy and blessed fathers, that is to say by the 318 God-inspired
fathers who met at Nice, and by those who met at Ancyra, and by those who met at
Neocæsarea, as well as by those who met at Gangra: in addition to these the canons adopted
by those who met at Antioch in Syria, and by those who met at Laodicea in Phrygia; moreover
by the 150 fathers who assembled in this divinely kept and imperial city, and by the 200 who
were gathered in the metropolis of Ephesus, and by the 630 holy and blessed fathers who
met at Chalcedon,” etc., etc.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that this collection of canons was made at a very early date, and
from the fact that the canons of the First Council of Constantinople do not appear, as they
naturally would, immediately after those of Nice, we may not improbably conclude that the
collection was formed before that council assembled. For it will be noticed that Nice, although
not the earliest in date, takes the precedence as being of ecumenical rank. And this
is expressly stated in the caption to the canons of Ancyra according to the reading in the
Paris Edition of Balsamon. “The canons of the holy Fathers who assembled at Ancyra; which
are indeed older than those made at Nice, but placed after them, on account of the authority
(αὐθεντίαν) of the Ecumenical Synod.”</p>
<p>On the arrangement of this code much has been written and Archbishop Ussher has
made some interesting suggestions, but all appear to be attended with more or less difficulties.
The reader will find in Bp. Beveridge, in the Prolegomena to his Synodicon a very
full treatment of the point,115 the gist of the matter is admirably given in the following brief
note which I take from Hammond. In speaking of this early codex of the Church he says:</p>
<p>(Hammond, Definitions of Faith and Canons of Discipline, pp. 134 and 135.)</p>
<p>That this collection was made and received by the Church previous to the Council of
Chalcedon is evident from the manner in which several of the Canons are quoted in that
Council. Thus in the 4th Action, in the matter of Carosus and Dorotheus, who had acknowledged
Dioscorus as Bishop, though he had been deposed from his bishopric, “the holy

Lib.]).</note>

<pb n="140"/>
Synod said, let the holy Canons of the Fathers be read, and inserted in the records; and Actius
the Archdeacon taking the book read the 83d Canon, If any Bishops, etc. And again
the 84th Canon, concerning those who separate themselves, If any Presbyter,” etc. These
Canons are the 4th and 5th of Antioch. Again, in the 11th Action, in the matter of Bassianus
and Stephanus who disputed about the Bishopric of Ephesus, both requested the Canons
to be read, “And the Judges said, Let the Canons be read. And Leontius Bishop of Magnesia
read the 95th Canon, If any Bishop, etc., and again out of the same book the 96th Canon,
If any Bishop,” etc. These Canons are the 16th and 17th of Antioch. Now if we add together
the different Canons in the Code of the Universal Church in the order in which they follow
in the enumeration of them by the Council of Trullo and in other documents, we find that
the 4th and 5th of Antioch, are the 83d and 84th of the whole Code, and the 16th and 17th
of Antioch, the 95th and 96th. Nice 20, Ancyra 25, Neocæsarea 14, Gangra 20; all which
make 79. Next come those of Antioch, the 4th and 5th of which therefore will be respectively
the 83d and 84th, and the 16th and 17th the 95th and 96th.</p>
<p>The fact of the existence of such a code does not prove by any means that it was the only
collection extant at the time nor that it was universally known. In fact we have good reason,
as we shall see in connexion with the Council of Sardica, to believe that in many codices,
probably especially in the West, the canons of that council followed immediately after those
of Nice, and that without any break or note whatever. But we know that the number of
canons attributed to Nice must have been twenty or else the numbering of the codex read
from at Chalcedon would be quite inexplicable. It would naturally suggest itself to the mind
that possibly the divergence in the canonical codes was the result of the local feelings of East
and West with regard to the decrees of Sardica. But this supposition, plausible as it appears,
must be rejected, since at the Quinisext Council, where it is not disputed there was a strong
anti-Western bias, the canons of Sardica are expressly enumerated among those which the
fathers receive as of Ecumenical authority. It will be noticed that the code set forth by the
Council in Trullo differs from the code used at Chalcedon by having the so-called “Canons
of the Apostles” prefixed to it, and by having a large number of other canons, including
those of Sardica, appended, of which more will be said when treating of that Council.</p>
<p>The order which I have followed my justly be considered as that of the earliest accepted
codex canonum, at least of the East.</p>

<head>Historical Note.</head>
<p>Soon after the death of the Emperor Maximin,116 a council was held at Ancyra, the
capital of Galatia. Only about a dozen bishops were present, and the lists of subscriptions
which are found appended to the canons are not to be depended on, being evidently in their
present form of later authorship; as has been shewn by the Ballerini. If we may at all trust
the lists, it would seem that nearly every part of Syria and Asia Minor was represented, and
that therefore the council while small in numbers was of considerable weight. It is not certain
whether Vitalis, (bishop of Antioch,) presided or Marcellus, who was at the time bishop of
Ancyra. The honour is by the Libellus Synodicus assigned to the latter.</p>
<p>The disciplinary decrees of this council possess a singular interest as being the first enacted
after the ceasing of the persecution of the Christians and as providing for the proper
treatment of the lapsed. Recently two papyri have been recovered, containing the official
certificates granted by the Roman government to those who had lapsed and offered sacrifice.
These apostates were obliged to acknowledge in public their adhesion to the national religion
of the empire, and then were provided with a document certifying to this fact to keep them
from further trouble. Dr. Harnack (Preussische Jahrbücher) writing of the yielding of the
lapsed says:</p>
<p>“The Church condemned this as lying and denial of the faith, and after the termination
of the persecution, these unhappy people were partly excommunicated, partly obliged to
submit to severe discipline. Who would ever suppose that the records of their shame would
come doom to our time?—and yet it has actually happened. Two of these papers have been
preserved, contrary to all likelihood, by the sands of Egypt which so carefully keep what has
been entrusted to them. The first was found by Krebs in a heap of papyrus, that had come
to Berlin; the other was found by Wessely in the papyrus collection of Archduke Rainer. ‘I,
Diogenes, have constantly sacrificed and made offerings, and have eaten in your presence
the sacrificial meat, and I petition you to give me a certificate.’ Who to-day, without deep
emotion, can read this paper and measure the trouble and terror of heart under which the
Christians of that day collapsed?”</p>

<p>With regard to those presbyters who have offered sacrifices and afterwards returned to
the conflict, not with hypocrisy, but in sincerity, it has seemed good that they may retain
the honour of their chair; provided they had not used management, arrangement, or persuasion,
so as to appear to be subjected to the torture, when it was applied only in seeming and
pretence. Nevertheless it is not lawful for them to make the oblation, nor to preach, nor in
short to perform any act of sacerdotal function.</p>

<p>Presbyters and deacons who offered sacrifice and afterwards renewed the contest for the
truth shall have only their seat and honour, but shall not perform any of the holy functions.
Zonaras.</p>
<p>Of those that yielded to the tyrants in the persecution, and offered sacrifice, some, after
having been subjected to torture, being unable to withstand to the end its force and intensity,
were conquered, and denied the faith; some, through effeminacy, before they experienced
any suffering, gave way, and lest they should seem to sacrifice voluntarily they persuaded
the executioners, either by bribes or entreaties, to manifest perhaps a greater degree of
severity against them, and seemingly to apply the torture to them, in order that sacrificing
under these circumstances they might seem to have denied Christ, conquered by force, and
not through effeminacy.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>It was quite justifiable, and in accordance with the ancient and severe discipline of the
Church, when this Synod no longer allowed priests, even when sincerely penitent, to discharge
priestly functions. It was for this same reason that the two Spanish bishops, Martial
and Basilides, were deposed, and that the judgment given against them was confirmed in
254 by an African synod held under St. Cyprian.</p>

<pb n="144"/>
<p>The reader will notice how clearly the functions of a presbyter are set forth in this canon
as they were understood at that time, they were “to offer” (προσφέρειν), “to preach” (ὁμιλεῖν),
and “to perform any act of sacerdotal function” (λειτουργεῖν τι τῶν ἱερατικῶν λειτουργιῶν).</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>It is likewise decreed that deacons who have sacrificed and afterwards resumed the
conflict, shall enjoy their other honours, but shall abstain from every sacred ministry, neither
bringing forth the bread and the cup, nor making proclamations. Nevertheless, if any of
the bishops shall observe in them distress of mind and meek humiliation, it shall be lawful
to the bishops to grant more indulgence, or to take away <del>what has been granted</del>.</p>
<p>For Ancient Epitome see above under Canon I.</p>
<p>In this canon the work and office of a deacon as then understood is set forth, viz.: “to
bring forth” (whatever that may mean) “bread or wine” (ἄρτον ἢ ποτηριον ἄναφέρειν) and
“to act the herald” (κηρύσσειν). There is considerable difference of opinion as to the
meaning of the first of these expressions. It was always the duty of the deacon to serve the
priest, especially when he ministered the Holy Communion, but this phrase may refer to
one of two such ministrations, either to bringing the bread and wine to the priest at the offertory,
and this is the view of Van Espen, or to the distribution of the Holy Sacrament to
the people. It has been urged that the deacon had ceased to administer the species of bread
before the time of this council, but Hefele shews that the custom had not entirely died out.</p>
<p>If I may be allowed to offer a suggestion, the use of the disjunctive ἢ seems rather to
point to the administration of the sacrament than to the bringing of the oblations at the offertory.</p>
<p>The other diaconal function “to act the herald” refers to the reading of the Holy Gospel,
and to the numerous proclamations made by the deacons at mass both according to the
Greek and Latin Rite.</p>

<p>Those who have fled and been apprehended, or have been betrayed by their servants;
or those who have been otherwise despoiled of their goods, or have endured tortures, or
have been imprisoned and abused, declaring themselves to be Christians; or who have been
forced to receive something which their persecutors violently thrust into their hands, or
meat [offered to idols], continually professing that they were Christians; and who, by their
whole apparel, and demeanour, and humility of life, always give evidence of grief at what
has happened; these persons, inasmuch as they are free from sin, are not to be repelled from
the communion; and if, through an extreme strictness or ignorance of some things, they
have been repelled, let them forthwith be re-admitted. This shall hold good alike of clergy
and laity. It has also been considered whether laymen who have fallen under the same
compulsion may be admitted to orders, and we have decreed that, since they have in no respect
been guilty, they may be ordained; provided their past course of life be found to have
been upright.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>Those who have been subjected to torments and have suffered violence, and have eaten
food offered to idols after being tyrannized over, shall not be deprived of communion. And
laymen who have endured the same sufferings, since they have in no way transgressed, if they
wish to be ordained, they may be, if otherwise they be blameless.</p>
<p>In the translation the word “abused” is given as the equivalent of περισχισθέντας , which
Zonaras translated, “if their clothes have been torn from their bodies,” and this is quite accurate
if the reading is correct, but Routh has found in the Bodleian several mss. which had
περισχεθέντας. Hefele adopts this reading and translates “declaring themselves to be
Christians but who have subsequently been vanquished, whether their oppressors have by
force put incense into their hands or have compelled them, etc.” Hammond translates “and
have been harassed by their persecutors forcibly putting something into their hands or who
have been compelled, etc.” The phrase is obscure at best with either reading.</p>

and in the third year let them communicate without oblation, so that in the fourth year they
may be received into full communion. But the bishops have the right, after considering the
character of their conversion, either to deal with them more leniently, or to extend the time.

<p>Herbst and Routh have been followed by many in supposing that “oblation” (προσφορά)
in this canon refers to the sacrament of the altar. But this seems to be a mistake, as the word
while often used to denote the whole act of the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, is not used
to mean the receiving alone of that sacrament.</p>
<p>Suicer (Thesaurus s.v. προσφορά) translates “They may take part in divine worship, but
not actively,” that is, “they may not mingle their offerings with those of the faithful.”
Hefele.</p>

the communion, the complete meaning of the canon is: “They may be present at divine
service, but may neither offer nor communicate with the faithful.”</p>

<p>Concerning those who have partaken at a heathen feast in a place appointed for heathens,

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</p>
<p>If anyone having his own food, shall eat it with heathen at their feasts, let him be a prostrator

<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Several Christians tried with worldly prudence, to take a middle course. On the one
hand, hoping to escape persecution, they were present at the feasts of the heathen sacrifices,
which were held in the buildings adjoining the temples; and on the other, in order to appease
their consciences, they took their own food, and touched nothing that had been offered to
the gods. These Christians forgot that St. Paul had ordered that meats sacrificed to the gods
should be avoided, not because they were tainted in themselves, as the idols were nothing,
but from another, and in fact a twofold reason: 1st, Because, in partaking of them, some
had still the idols in their hearts, that is to say, were still attached to the worship of idols,
and thereby sinned; and 2dly, Because others scandalized their brethren, and sinned in that
way. To these two reasons a third may be added, namely, the hypocrisy and the duplicity
of those Christians who wished to appear heathens, and nevertheless to remain Christians.
The Synod punished them with two years of penance in the third degree, and gave to each
bishop the right, at the expiration of this time, either to admit them to communion, or to
make them remain some time longer in the fourth degree.</p>

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon X.</p>
<p>Whoso is to be ordained deacon, if he has before announced to the bishop that he cannot
persevere unmarried, let him marry and let him be a deacon; but if he shall have kept silence,
should he take a wife afterwards let him be cast out.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The case proposed to the synod and decided in this canon was as follows: When the
bishop was willing to ordain two to the diaconate, one of them declared that he did not intend
to bind himself to preserving perpetual continence, but intended to get married, because
he had not the power to remain continent. The other said nothing. The bishop laid his
hands on each and conferred the diaconate.</p>
<p>After the ordination it fell out that both got married, the question propounded is, What
must be done in each case? The synod ruled that he who had made protestation at his ordination
should remain in his ministry, “because of the license of the bishop,” that is that
he might contract matrimony after the reception of the diaconate. With regard to him who
kept silence the synod declares that he should cease from his ministry.</p>
<p>The resolution of the synod to the first question shews that there was a general law
which bound the deacons to continence; but this synod judged it meet that the bishops for
just cause might dispense with this law, and this license or dispensation was deemed to have
been given by the bishop if he ordained him after his protestation at the time of his ordination
that he intended to be married, because he could not remain as he was; giving by the act of
ordination his tacit approbation. Moreover from this decision it is also evident that not
only was the ordained deacon allowed to enter but also to use matrimony after his ordination.<gap reason="omitted"/>
Moreover the deacon who after this protestation entered and used matrimony, not
only remained a deacon, but continued in the exercise of his ministry.</p>

<head>Canon XIII.</head>
<p>It is not lawful for Chorepiscopi to ordain presbyters or deacons, and most assuredly

parish.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</p>
<p>A chorepiscopus is not to ordain without the consent of the bishop.
Hefele.</p>
<p>If the first part of the thirteenth canon is easy to understand, the second, on the contrary,
presents a great difficulty; for a priest of a town could not in any case have the power of
consecrating priests and deacons, least of all in a strange diocese. Many of the most learned
men have, for this reason, supposed that the Greek text of the second half of the canon, as
we have read it, is incorrect or defective. It wants, say they, ποιεῖν τι, or aliquid agere, i.e.,
to complete a religious function. To confirm this supposition, they have appealed to several
ancient versions, especially to that of Isidore: sed nec presbyteris civitatis sine episcopi præcepto
amplius aliquid imperare, vel sine auctoritate literarum ejus in unaquaque (some read
ἐν ἐκάστῃ instead of ἐν ἑτέρᾳ) parochia aliquid agere. The ancient Roman ms. of the canons,
Codex Canonum, has the same reading, only that it has provincia instead of parochia. Fulgentius
Ferrandus, deacon of Carthage, who long ago made a collection of canons, translates
in the same way in his Breviatio Canonum: Ut presbyteri civitatis sine jussu episcopi nihil
jubeant, nec in unaquaque parochia aliquid agant. Van Espen has explained this canon in
the same way.</p>
<p>Routh has given another interpretation. He maintained that there was not a word
missing in this canon, but that at the commencement one ought to read, according to several
mss. χωρεπισκόποις in the dative, and further down ἀλλὰ μὴν μηδὲ instead of ἀλλα μηδὲ
then πρεσβυτέρους (in the accusative) πόλεως and finally ἐκάστῃ instead of ἑτέρᾳ, and that
we must therefore translate, “Chorepiscopi are not permitted to consecrate priests and deacons
(for the country) still less (ἀλλὰ μὴν μηδὲ) can they consecrate priests for the town without
the consent of the bishop of the place.” The Greek text, thus modified according to some
mss., especially those in the Bodleian Library, certainly gives a good meaning. Still ἀλλὰ
μὴν μηδὲ does not mean, but still less: it means, but certainly not, which makes a considerable
difference.</p>

<pb n="158"/>
<p>Besides this, it can very seldom have happened that the chorepiscopi ordained presbyters
or deacons for a town; and if so, they were already forbidden, at least implicitly, in the first
part of the canon.</p>

<p>It is decreed that among the clergy, presbyters and deacons who abstain from flesh shall

not even eat herbs served with flesh, but disobey the canon, let them be removed from their
order.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</p>
<p>A priest who is an abstainer from flesh, let him merely taste it and so let him abstain. But
if he will not taste even the vegetables cooked with the meat let him be deposed (πεπάυσθω).</p>
<p>There is a serious dispute about the reading of the Greek text. I have followed Routh,
who, relying on three mss. the Collectio of John of Antioch and the Latin versions, reads εἰ
δὲ βδελύσσοιντο instead of the εἰ δὲ βούλοιντο of the ordinary text, which as Bp. Beveridge
had pointed out before has no meaning unless a μὴ be introduced.</p>
<p>Zonaras points out that the canon chiefly refers to the Love feasts.</p>
<p>I cannot agree with Hefele in his translation of the last clause. He makes the reference
to “this present canon,” I think it is clearly to the 53 (52) of the so-called Canons of the
Apostles, τῷ κανόνι “the well-known Canon.”</p>

<p>If the purchaser of ecclesiastical properties has realized more by the temporary revenue

and as, according to the rules then in force, interest drawn from the purchase money was
not permitted. Besides, the purchaser had done wrong in buying ecclesiastical property
during the vacancy of a see (sede vacante). Beveridge and Routh have shown that in the

And if any who have passed this age and had wives, have fallen into this sin, let them be
prostrators twenty-five years, and then communicate in prayers; and, after they have been
five years in the communion of prayers, let them share the oblation. And if any married

do so when over fifty years of age, shall be a prostrator to his life’s end.

<head>Canon XVII.</head>
<p>Defilers of themselves with beasts, being also leprous, who have infected others <del>with
the leprosy of this crime</del>, the holy Synod commands to pray among the hiemantes.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.</p>
<p>A leper who goes in to a beast or even to leprous women, shall pray with the hybernantes.</p>
<p>Λεπρώσαντας is from λεπρόω not from λεπράω and therefore cannot mean “have been
lepers,” but “have made others rough and scabby.” It is only in the passive and in Alexandrian
Greek that it has the meaning to become leprous. Vide Liddell and Scott.</p>
<p>There seems but little doubt that the word is to be understood spiritually as suggested
above.</p>
<p>The last word of the canon is also a source of confusion. Both Beveridge and Routh
understand by the χειμαζόμενοι those possessed with devils. Suicer however (Thesaurus)
thinks that the penitents of the lowest degree are intended, who had no right to enter the
church, but were exposed in the open porch to the inclemencies (χειμών) of the weather.
But, after all it matters little, as the possessed also were forced to remain in the same place,
and shared the same name.</p>
<p>Besides the grammatical reason for the meaning of λεπρώσαντας given above there is
another argument of Hefele’s, as follows:</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>It is clear that λεπρώσαντας cannot possibly mean “those who have been lepers”; for
there is no reason to be seen why those who were cured of that malady should have to remain
outside the church among the flentes. Secondly, it is clear that the words λεπροὺς ὄντας,
etc. are added to give force to the expression ἀλογευσάμενοι. The preceding canon had
decreed different penalties for different kinds of ἀλογευσάμενοι. But that pronounced by
canon xvii. being much severer than the preceding ones, the ἀλογευσάμενοι of this canon
must be greater sinners than those of the former one. This greater guilt cannot consist in
the fact of a literal leprosy; for this malady was not a consequence of bestiality. But their
sin was evidently greater when they tempted others to commit it. It is therefore λέπρα in
the figurative sense that we are to understand, and our canon thus means; “Those who were
spiritually leprous through this sin, and tempting others to commit it made them leprous.”</p>

<p>According to some of the ancient canons digamists were to be suspended from communion
for one or two years, though Beveridge and others doubt whether the rule was not
meant to apply to such marriages only as were contracted before a former one was dissolved.
Bingham thinks that it was intended to discountenance marrying after an unlawful divorce.
(Ant., Bk. xv, c. iv., § 18.)119</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The first part of this canon regards all young persons—men as well as women—who
have taken a vow of virginity, and who, having thus, so to speak, betrothed themselves to
God are guilty of a quasi digamy in violating that promise. They must therefore incur the
punishment of digamy (successiva) which, according to St. Basil the Great, consisted of one
year’s seclusion.</p>
<p>This canon is found in Gratian’s Decretum (P. II., Causa xxvii., Q. i., c. xxiv.) as follows:
“As many as have professed virginity and have broken their vow and contemned their profession
shall be treated as digamists, that is as those who have contracted a second marriage.”</p>
<note type="footnote">118 Aristenus understands this to mean to “live with,” using the verb συναναστρέφεσθαι.</note>
<note type="footnote">119 This view of Bingham’s would seem to be untenable, since the penance would have been for adultery not
for digamy had the former marriage still been in force.</note>

<head>Excursus on Second Marriages, Called Digamy.</head>
<p>To distinguish contemporaneous from successive bigamy I shall use throughout this
volume the word “digamy” to denote the latter, and shall thus avoid much confusion which
otherwise is unavoidable.</p>
<p>The whole subject of second, and even of third and fourth marriages has a great interest
for the student of early ecclesiastical legislation, and I shall therefore treat the matter here
(as I shall hope) sufficiently and refer the reader for its fuller treatment to books more especially
upon the subject.</p>
<p>The general position of the Church seems to have been to discourage all second marriages,
and to point to a single matrimonial connexion as the more excellent way. But at
the same time the principle that the marriage obligation is severed by death was universally
recognised, and however much such fresh marriages may have been disapproved of, such
disapproval did not rest upon any supposed adulterous character in the new connexion. I
cite a portion of an admirable article upon the subject by an English barrister of Lincoln’s
Inn.</p>
<p>(J. M. Ludlow, in Smith and Cheetham, Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, sub voce Digamy.)</p>
<p>Although among the earlier Romans120 there was one form of marriage which was indissoluble,
viz., that by confarreatio, still generally a second marriage either after death or
divorce was by no means viewed with disfavour.…Meanwhile an intensifying spirit of asceticism
was leading many in the Church to a condemnation of second marriage in all cases.
Minucius Felix (Octavius, c. 31, § 5) only professes on behalf of the Christians a preference
for monogamy. Clement of Alexandria (a.d. 150–220) seems to confine the term marriage
to the first lawful union (Stromata, Bk. ii.).…It would seem, however, that when these views
were carried to the extent of absolute prohibition of second marriages generally by several
heretical sects, the Montanists (see Augustine, De Hæresibus, c. xxvi.), the Cathari (ib., c.
xxxviii.), and a portion at least of the Novatianists (see Cotel., Patr. Apol., vol. i., p. 91, n.
16) the Church saw the necessity of not fixing such a yoke on the necks of the laity. The
forbiddance of second marriage, or its assimilation to fornication, was treated as one of the
marks of heresy (Augustin. u. s.; and see also his De Bono Vid., c. vi.). The sentiment of
Augustine (in the last referred to passage) may be taken to express the Church’s judgment
at the close of the fourth century: “Second marriages are not to be condemned, but had in
less honour,” and see also Epiphanius, in his Exposition of the Catholic Faith.</p>
<note type="footnote">120 The reader may recall the words of Dido: Ille meos, primusqui me sibi junxit, amores Abstulit; ille habeat
secum servetque sepulcro</note>

<pb n="166"/>
<p>To these remarks of Mr. Ludlow’s, I may add that St. Ambrose had written (De Viduis,
c. xi.), “We do not prohibit second marriages, but we do not approve marriages frequently
reiterated.” St. Jerome had spoken still more strongly (Ep. lxvii., Apol. pro libris adv. Jovin.),
“I do not condemn digamists, or even trigamists or, if such a thing can be said, octagamists.”
It does not seem that the penance which was imposed in the East upon those entering into
second nuptials was imposed in the West. The Corpus Juris Canonici contains two decretals,
one of Alexander III. and another of Urban III., forbidding priests to give the nuptial bene-
diction in cases of reiterated marriage. In the East at second marriages the benediction of
the crown is omitted and “propitiatory prayers” are to be said. Mr. Ludlow points out that
in the “Sanctions and Decrees,” falsely attributed to the Council of Nice and found in Mansi
(vol. ii., col. 1029) it is expressly stated that widowers and widows may marry, but that “the
blessing of the crowns is not to be imparted to them, for this is only once given, at first
marriages, and is not to be repeated.…But if one of them be not a widower or widow, let
such one alone receive the benediction with the paranymphs, those whom he will.”</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.</p>
<p>An adulteress and an adulterer are to be cut off for seven years.
Hefele.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation of this canon is “that the man or woman who has violated the
marriage bond shall undergo a seven years’ penance”; but many reject this explanation, because
the text says αὐτὸν τύχειν and consequently can refer only to the husband. Fleury
and Routh think the canon speaks, as does the seventieth of Elvira, of a woman who has
broken the marriage tie with the knowledge and consent of her husband. The husband
would therefore in this case be punished for this permission, just as if he had himself committed
adultery. Van Espen has given another explanation: “That he who marries a woman
already divorced for adultery is as criminal as if he had himself committed adultery.” But
this explanation appears to us more forced than that already given; and we think that the
Greek commentators Balsamon and Zonaras were right in giving the explanation we have
offered first as the most natural. They think that the Synod punished every adulterer,
whether man or woman, by a seven years’ penance. There is no reason for making a mistake
because only the word αὐτὸν occurs in the passage in which the penalty is fixed; for αὐτὸν
here means the guilty party, and applies equally to the woman and the man: besides, in the
preceding canon the masculine ὅσοι ἐπαγγελλόμενοι includes young men and young women
also. It is probable that the Trullan Synod of 692, in forming its eighty-seventh canon, had
in view the twentieth of Ancyra. The sixty-ninth canon of Elvira condemned to a lighter
punishment—only five years of penance—him who had been only once guilty of adultery.</p>

the synod of having done so, he defended himself by citing the canon which gives bishops
the power of remitting or increasing the length of their penance to penitents. But he was
told in answer that this was granted indeed to pontiffs but not that they should use it without
examination, and with too great lenity. Wherefore the synod subjected the soldier to the

after that of Ancyra, and earlier in date than the rest, even than the First Ecumenical Synod
at Nice. In this synod the Holy Fathers gathered together, among whom was the holy

<head>Canon I.</head>
<p>If a presbyter marry, let him be removed from his order; but if he commit fornication
or adultery, let him be altogether cast out <del>i.e. of communion</del> and put to penance.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</p>
<p>If a presbyter marries he shall be deposed from his order. If he commits adultery or
whoredom he shall be expelled, and shall be put to penance.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>A presbyter who marries is removed from the exercise of the priesthood but retains his
honour and seat. But he that commits fornication or adultery is cast forth altogether and
put to penance.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>These fathers <del>i.e. of Neocæsarea</del> shew how much graver seemed to them the sin of the
presbyter who after ordination committed fornication or adultery, than his who took a wife.
For the former they declare shall simply be deposed from his order or deprived of the dignity
of the Priesthood, but the latter is to “be altogether cast out, and put to penance.”…Therefore
such a presbyter not only did they remove from the priestly functions, or the dignity of the
priesthood, but perfectly or altogether cast him out of the Church.</p>
<p>This canon Gratian has inserted in the Corpus Juris Canonici. Decretum. Pars I., Dist.
xxviii., c. ix. Gratian has followed Isidore in adding after the word “penance” the words
“among the laity” (inter laicos) which do not occur in the Greek, (as is noted by the Roman
<note type="footnote">122 This is the title in the Paris edition of Zonaras.</note>

<pb n="176"/>
Correctors) nor in the version of Dionysius Exiguus; these same correctors fall however
themselves into a still graver error in supposing that criminous clerks in the early days of
the Church were sent out to wander over the country, as Van Espen well points out.

devoted to that subject.</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>If a woman shall have married two brothers, let her be cast out [i.e. of communion]
until her death. Nevertheless, at the hour of death she may, as an act of mercy, be received
to penance, provided she declare that she will break the marriage, should she recover. But
if the woman in such a marriage, or the man, die, penance for the survivor shall be very
difficult.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</p>
<p>A woman married to two brothers shall be expelled all her life. But if when near her death
she promises that she will loose the marriage should she recover, she shall be admitted to
penance. But if one of those coupled together die, only with great difficulty shall penitence be
allowed to the one still living.</p>
<p>It will be carefully observed that this canon has no provision for the case of a man
marrying two sisters. It is the prohibited degree of brother’s wife, not that of wife’s sister
which is in consideration. Of course those who hold that the affinity is the same in each
case will argue from this canon by parity of reasoning, and those who do not accept that
position will refuse to do so.</p>
<p>In the Greek text of Balsamon (Vide Beveridge, Synod.) after the first clause is added,
“if she will not be persuaded to loose the marriage.”</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The meaning of this canon seems to be that which Balsamon sets forth, to wit, that if a
woman at the point of death or in extremis promises that if she gets better she will dissolve
the marriage, or make a divorce, or abstain from the sacrilegious use of matrimony, then
“she may be received to penance as an act of mercy”; and surely she is immediately absolved
from the excommunication inflicted upon her when she was cast out and extruded from
the Church. For it is certain that according to the discipline of the Fathers he was thought
to be loosed from excommunication whoever was admitted to penance, and it is of this that
the canon speaks;123 but he did not obtain perfect reconciliation until his penance was done.</p>
<p>To this performance of penance this woman was to be admitted if she got well and dissolved
the marriage according to her promise made when she was in peril of death, as the
Greek commentators note; and this too is the sense given by Isidore.</p>

<head>Canon III.</head>
<p>Concerning those who fall into many marriages, the appointed time of penance is well
known; but their manner of living and faith shortens the time.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>The time of polygamists is well known. A zeal for penance may shorten it.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>As the Greek commentators have remarked, this canon speaks of those who have been
married more than twice. It is not known what were the ancient ordinances of penitence
which the synod here refers to. In later times digamists were condemned to one year’s
penance, and trigamists from two to five years. St. Basil places the trigamists for three years
among the “hearers,” and then for some time among the consistentes.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>“The appointed time of penance is well known.” These words Zonaras notes must refer
to a custom, for, says he, “before this synod no canon is found which prescribes the duration
of the penance of bigamists [i.e. digamists].” It is for this reason that St. Basil says (in Epist.
ad Amphilogium, Can. 4) in speaking of the penance of trigamists “we have received this by
custom and not by canon, but from the following of precedent,” hence the Fathers received
many things by tradition, and observed these as having the force of law.</p>
<p>From the last clause of this canon we see the mind of the Fathers of this synod, which
agrees with that of Ancyra and Nice, that; with regard to the granting of indulgences, for in
shortening the time of penance, attention must be paid to the penitence, and conversation,
or “conversation and faith” of each one separately.</p>
<p>With this agrees Zonaras, whose remarks are worthy of consideration. On this whole
subject of the commutation of the primitive penance and of the rise of the modern indulgences
of the Roman Church Van Espen has written at length in his excursus De Indulgentiis
(Jure Eccles., P. I. i., Tit. vij.) in which he assigns the change to the end of the XIth century,
and remarks that its introduction caused the “no small collapse of penitential discipline.”124</p>

<head>Canon IV.</head>
<p>If any man lusting after a woman purposes to lie with her, and his design does not come
to effect, it is evident that he has been saved by grace.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</p>
<p>Whoso lusteth but doth not accomplish his pleasure is preserved of God.
Hefele.</p>
<p>Instead of ἑπιθυμῆσαι we must read, with Beveridge and Routh, who rely upon several
mss., ἐπιθυμήσας. They also replace μετ᾽ αὐτῆς by αὐτῇ.</p>
<p>The meaning of the canon appears to me to be very obscure. Hefele refers to Van Espen
and adopts his view, and Van Espen in turn has adopted Fleury’s view and given him credit
for it, referring to his Histoire Ecclesiastique, Lib. X., xvij. Zonaras’ and Balsamon’s notes
are almost identical, I translate that of the latter in full.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>In sins, the Fathers say, there are four stages, the first-motion, the struggle, the consent,
and the act: the first two of these are not subject to punishment, but in the two others the
case is different. For neither is the first impression nor the struggle against it to be condemned,
provided that when the reason receives the impression it struggles with it and rejects
the thought. But the consent thereto is subject to condemnation and accusation, and the
action to punishment. If therefore anyone is assailed by the lust for a woman, and is overcome
so that he would perform the act with her, he has given consent, indeed, but to the
work he has not come, that is, he has not performed the act, and it is manifest that the grace
of God has preserved him; but he shall not go off with impunity. For the consent alone is
worthy of punishment. And this is plain from canon lxx. of St. Basil, which says; “A deacon
polluted in lips (ἐν χείλεσι)” or who has approached to the kiss of a woman “and confesses
that he has so sinned, is to be interdicted his ministry,” that is to say is to be prohibited its
exercise for a time. “But he shall not be deemed unworthy to communicate in sacris with
the deacons. The same is also the case with a presbyter. But if anyone shall go any further
in sin than this, no matter what his grade, he shall be deposed.” Some, however, interpret

<pb n="181"/>
the pollution of the lips in another way; of this I shall speak in commenting on Canon lxx.
of St. Basil.125</p>

<head>Canon V.</head>
<p>If a catechumen coming into the Church have taken his place in the order of catechumens,
and fall into sin, let him, if a kneeler, become a hearer and sin no more. But should
he again sin while a hearer, let him be cast out.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</p>
<p>If a catechumen falls into a fault and if while a kneeler he sins no more, let him be among
the hearers; but should he sin while among the hearers, let him be cast out altogether.
Zonaras.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of catechumens. For some have only just come in and these, as still
imperfect, go out immediately after the reading of the scriptures and of the Gospels. But
there are others who have been for some time in preparation and have attained some perfection;
these wait after the Gospel for the prayers for the catechumens, and when they hear
the words “Catechumens, bow down your heads to the Lord,” they kneel down. These, as
being more perfect, having tasted the good words of God, if they fall, are removed from
their position; and are placed with the “hearers”; but if any happen to sin while “hearers”
they are cast out of the Church altogether.</p>

<head>Canon VI.</head>
<p>Concerning a woman with child, it is determined that she ought to be baptized whensoever
she will; for in this the woman communicates nothing to the child, since the bringing
forward to profession is evidently the individual <del>privilege</del> of every single person.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>If a woman with child so desires, let her be baptized. For the choice of each one is judged
of.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>That the reason of the canon may be understood it must be noted that in the first ages
of the Church catechumens were examined concerning their faith before they were baptized,
and were made publicly to confess their faith and to renounce openly the pomps of the
world, as Albaspinæus (Aubespine) observes on this canon, “A short while before they were
immersed they declared with a loud voice that they desired baptism and wished to be baptized.
And since these confessions could not be made by those still shut up in their parent’s
womb, to them the thing (res) and grace of baptism could not come nor penetrate.” And
altogether in accord with this is the translation of Isidore— “because the free will of each
one is declared in that confession,” that is, in that confession he declares that he willingly
desires to be baptized.</p>

<head>Canon VII.</head>
<p>A presbyter shall not be a guest at the nuptials of persons contracting a second marriage;
for, since the digamist is worthy of penance, what kind of a presbyter shall he be, who, by
being present at the feast, sanctioned the marriage?</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</p>
<p>A presbyter ought not to be present at the marriage of digamists. For when that one126
implores favour, who will deem him worthy of favour.
Hefele.</p>
<p>The meaning of the canon is as follows: “If the digamist, after contracting his second
marriage, comes to the priest to be told the punishment he has to undergo, how stands the
priest himself who for the sake of the feast has become his accomplice in the offence?”
Van Espen.</p>
<p>The present canon again shews that although the Church never disapproved of, nor
reputed second or still later marriages illicit, nevertheless the Fathers enjoined a penance
upon digamists and those repeating marriage, because by this iteration they shewed their
incontinence. As he that contracted a second marriage did not sin properly speaking, and
committed no fault worthy of punishment, therefore whatever was amiss was believed to
be paid off by a lighter penance, and Zonaras supposes that the canons inflicted a mulct
upon digamists, for saith he, “Digamists are not allowed for one year to receive the Holy
Gifts.”</p>
<p>Zonaras seems to indicate that the discipline of the canon was not in force in his time,
for he says, “Although this is found in our writings, yet we ourselves have seen the Patriarch
and many Metropolitans present at the feast for the second nuptials of the Emperor.”
126 Bp. Beveridge for “that one” translates “the digamist.” The meaning is very obscure at best.</p>

<p>If the wife of a layman has committed adultery and been clearly convicted, such [a
husband] cannot enter the ministry; and if she commit adultery after his ordination, he
must put her away; but if he retain her, he can have no part in the ministry committed to
him.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</p>
<p>A layman whose wife is an adulteress cannot be a clergyman, and a cleric who keeps an
adulteress shall be expelled.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Although the Eastern Church allows the clergy to have wives, even priests, and permits
to them the use of marriage after ordination, nevertheless it requires of them the highest
conjugal continency, as is seen by the present canon. For here it is evident that the Fathers
wished even the smallest possible kind of incontinence to be absent from men dedicated to
holiness.</p>

<head>Canon IX.</head>
<p>A presbyter who has been promoted after having committed carnal sin, and who shall
confess that he had sinned before his ordination, shall not make the oblation, though he
may remain in his other functions on account of his zeal in other respects; for the majority
have affirmed that ordination blots out other kinds of sins. But if he do not confess and
cannot be openly convicted, the decision shall depend upon himself.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</p>
<p>If a presbyter confess that he has sinned,127 let him abstain from the oblation, and from
it only. For certain sins orders remit. If he neither confess nor is convicted, let him have power
over himself.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Therefore if he who before his ordination had committed a sin of the flesh with a woman,
confess it after ordination, when he is already a priest, he cannot perform the priestly office,
he can neither offer nor consecrate the oblations, even though after his ordination he has
preserved uprightness of living and been careful to exercise virtue; as the words “zeal in
other respects” (“studious of good”) Zonaras rightly interprets.</p>
<p>And since here the consideration is of a sin committed before ordination, and also
concerning a presbyter who after his ordination was of spotless life, and careful to exercise
virtue, the Fathers rightly wished that he should not, against his will, be deposed from the
priestly office.</p>
<p>It is certainly curious that this canon speaks of ordination as in the opinion of most
persons taking away all sins except consummated carnal offences. And it will be noted that
the ἀφιέναι must mean more than that they are forgiven by ordination, for they had been
forgiven long ago by God upon true contrition, but that they were made to be non-existent,
as if they had never been, so that they were no hinderance to the exercise of the spiritual
office. I offer no explanation of the difficulty and only venture to doubt the satisfactory
character of any of the explanations given by the commentators. Moreover it is hard to
grasp the logical connexion of the clauses, and what this “blotting out” of τὰ λοιπὰ has to
do with the matter I entirely fail to see. The καὶ after πολλοὶ may possibly suggest that
something has dropped out.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</p>
<p>Unless he be xxx. years of age none shall be presbyter, even should he be worthy, following

lxxviii., c. iv.</p>
<p>Gratian.</p>
<p>(Ut supra, Nota.)</p>
<p>This is the law, and we do not read that Christ, or John the Baptist, or Ezechiel, or some
other of the Prophets prophesied or preached before that age. But Jeremiah and Daniel we
read received the spirit of prophecy before they had arrived even at youth, and David and
Solomon are found to have been anointed in their youth, also John the Evangelist, while
still a youth, was chosen by the Lord for an Apostle, and we find that with the rest he was
sent forth to preach: Paul also, as we know, while still a young man was called by the Lord,
and was sent out to preach. The Church in like manner, when necessity compels, is wont
to ordain some under thirty years of age.</p>
<p>For this reason Pope Zacharias in his Letter to Boniface the Bishop, number vi., which
begins “Benedictus Deus” says,</p>
<p>C. v. In case of necessity presbyters may be ordained at xxv. years of age.
If men thirty years old cannot be found, and necessity so demand, Levites and priests
may be ordained from twenty-five years of age upwards.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The power of dispensing was committed to the bishop, and at length it was so frequently
exercised that in the space of one century [i.e. by the end of the xiith century] the law became
abrogated, which was brought about by necessity, so that it passed into law that a presbyter
could be ordained at twenty-five. And from this it may appear how true it is that there is
no surer way of destroying discipline and abrogating law than the allowing of dispensations
and relaxations. Vide Thomassinus, De Disc. Eccles., Pars. IV., Lib. I., cap. 46.</p>

of men.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</p>
<p>One baptized on account of sickness is not to be made presbyter, unless in reward for a
contest which he afterwards sustains and on account of scarcity of men.
The word used in the Greek for “baptized” is “illuminated” (φωτισθῇ), a very common
expression among the ancients.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>He that is baptised by reason of illness, and, therefore come to his illumination not
freely but of necessity, shall not be admitted to the priesthood unless both these conditions
concur, that there are few suitable men to be found and that he has endured a hard conflict
after his baptism.</p>
<p>With this interpretation agree also Zonaras and Balsamon, the latter expressly saying,
“If one of these conditions is lacking, the canon must be observed.” Not only has Isidore
therefore missed the meaning by changing the copulative into the disjunctive conjunction
(as Van Espen points out) but Beveridge has fallen into the same error, not indeed in the
canon itself, but in translating the Ancient Epitome.</p>
<p>Zonaras explains that the reason for this prohibition was the well-known fact that in
those ages baptism was put off so as the longer to be free from the restraints which baptism
was considered to impose. From this interpretation only Aubespine dissents, and Hefele
points out how entirely without reason.</p>

<p>The deacons ought to be seven in number, according to the canon, even if the city be
great. Of this you will be persuaded from the Book of the Acts.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.</p>
<p>Seven Deacons according to the Acts of the Apostles should be appointed for each great
city.</p>
<p>This canon was observed in Rome and it was not until the xith century that the number
of the Seven Cardinal Deacons was changed to fourteen. That Gratian received it into the
Decretum (Pars. I., Dist. XCIII., c. xij.) is good evidence that he considered it part of the
Roman discipline. Eusebius128 gives a letter of Pope Cornelius, written about the middle
of the third century, which says that at that time there were at Rome forty-four priests, seven
deacons, and seven subdeacons; and that the number of those in inferior orders was very
great. Thomassinus says that, “no doubt in this the Roman Church intended to imitate the
Apostles who only ordained seven deacons. But the other Churches did not keep themselves
so scrupulously to that number.”129</p>
<p>In the acts of the Council of Chalcedon it is noted that the Church of Edessa had fifteen
priests and thirty-eight deacons.130 And Justinian, we know, appointed one hundred deacons
for the Church of Constantinople. Van Espen well points out that while this canon refers
to a previous law on the subject, neither the Council itself, nor the Greek commentators
Balsamon or Zonaras give the least hint as to what that Canon was.</p>
<p>The Fathers of Neocæsarea base their limiting of the number of deacons to seven in one
city upon the authority of Holy Scripture, but the sixteenth canon of the Quinisext Council
expressly says that in doing so they showed they referred to ministers of alms, not to ministers
at the divine mysteries, and that St. Stephen and the rest were not deacons at all in this latter
sense. The reader is referred to this canon, where to defend the practice of Constantinople
the meaning of the canon we are considering is entirely misrepresented.</p>

<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>With regard to the Synod of Gangra we know little beside what we learn from its own
synodal letter. Three great questions naturally arise with regard to it.</p>
<p>1. What was its date?</p>
<p>2. Who was the Eustathius it condemned?</p>
<p>3. Who was its presiding officer?</p>
<p>I shall briefly give the reader the salient points with regard to each of these matters.</p>
<p>1. With regard to the date, there can be no doubt that it was after Nice and before the
First Council of Constantinople, that is between 325 and 381. Socrates131 seems to place it
about 365; but Sozomen132 some twenty years earlier. On the other hand, Remi Ceillier133
inconsistently with his other statements, seems to argue from St. Basil’s letters that the true
date is later than 376. Still another theory has been urged by the Ballerini, resting on the
supposition that the Eusebius who presided was Eusebius of Cæsarea, and they therefore
fix the date between 362 and 370. With this Mr. Ffoulkes agrees, and fixes the date,134 with
Pagi, at 358, and is bold enough to add, “and this was unquestionably the year of the
Council.” But in the old collections of canons almost without exception, the canons of
Gangra precede those of Antioch, and Blondel and Tillemont135 have sustained this, which
perhaps I may call the traditional date.</p>
<p>2. There does not seem to be any reasonable ground to doubt that the person condemned,
Eustathius by name, was the famous bishop of Sebaste. This may be gathered from
both Sozomen136 and Socrates,137 and is confirmed incidentally by one of St. Basil’s
epistles.138 Moreover, Eustathius’s See of Sebaste is in Armenia, and it is to the bishops of
Armenia that the Synod addresses its letter. It would seem in view of all this that Bp. Hefele’s
words are not too severe when he writes, “Under such circumstances the statement of Baronius,
Du Pin, and others (supported by no single ancient testimony) that another Eustathius,
or possibly the monk Eutactus, is here meant, deserves no serious consideration, though
Tillemont did not express himself as opposed to it.”139</p>

<pb n="196"/>
<p>The story that after his condemnation by the Synod of Gangra Eustathius gave up
wearing his peculiar garb and other eccentricities, Sozomen only gives as a report.140</p>
<p>3. As to who was the president, it seems tolerably certain that his name was Eusebius—if
Sozomen141 indeed means it was “Eusebius of Constantinople,” it is a blunder, yet he had
the name right. In the heading of the Synodal letter Eusebius is first named, and as Gangra
and Armenia were within the jurisdiction of Cæsarea, it certainly would seem natural to
suppose that the Eusebius named was the Metropolitan of that province, but it must be remembered
that Eusebius of Cappadocia was not made bishop until 362, four years after Mr.
Ffoulkes makes him preside at Gangra. The names of thirteen bishops are given in the
Greek text.</p>
<p>The Latin translations add other names, such as that of Hosius of Cordova, and some
Latin writers have asserted that he presided as legate à latere from the pope, e.g., Baronius142
and Binius.143 Hefele denies this and says: “At the time of the Synod of Gangra Hosius was
without doubt dead.”144 But such has not been the opinion of the learned, and Cave145 is
of opinion that Hosius’s episcopate covered seventy years ending with 361, and (resting on
the same opinion) Pagi thinks Hosius may have attended the Synod in 358 on his way back
to Spain, an opinion with which, as I have said, Mr. Ffoulkes agrees. It seems also clear that
by the beginning of the sixth century the Synod of Gangra was looked upon at Rome as
having been held under papal authority; Pope Symmachus expressly saying so to the Roman
Synod of 504. (Vide Notes on Canons vij. and viij.)</p>
<p>It remains only further to remark that the Libellus Synodicus mentions a certain Dius
as president of the Synod. The Ballarini146 suggest that it should be Βίος, an abbreviation
of Eusebius. Mr. Ffoulkes suggests that Dius is “probably Dianius, the predecessor of Eusebius.”
Lightfoot147 fixes the episcopate of Eusebius Pamphili as between 313 and 337; and
<note type="footnote">140 Soz. H. E., Lib. III., cap. xiv. It is curious that Canon Venables in his article “Eustathius” in Smith and
Wace, Dict. of Christ. Biog., gives the story on Sozoman’s authority as quoted by Hefele, but without giving
Hefele’s warning that it was a mere rumour. It would seem that Canon Venables could not have consulted the
Greek, where the word used is λόγος; Hefele gives no reference. I have supplied this in the beginning of this
note.</note>

enormous chronological difficulties will be evident to the reader.</p>

<head>Synodical Letter of the Council of Gangra.</head>
<p>Eusebius, Ælian, Eugenius, Olympius, Bithynicus, Gregory, Philetus, Pappus, Eulalius,
Hypatius, Proæresius, Basil and Bassus,148 assembled in the holy Synod at Gangra, to our
most honoured lords and fellow-ministers in Armenia wish health in the Lord.</p>
<p>Forasmuch as the most Holy Synod of Bishops, assembled on account of certain necessary
matters of ecclesiastical business in the Church at Gangra, on inquiring also into the matters
which concern Eustathius, found that many things had been unlawfully done by these very
men who are partisans of Eustathius, it was compelled to make definitions, which it has
hastened to make known to all, for the removal of whatever has by him been done amiss.
For, from their utter abhorrence of marriage, and from their adoption of the proposition
that no one living in a state of marriage has any hope towards God, many misguided married
women have forsaken their husbands, and husbands their wives: then, afterwards, not being
able to contain, they have fallen into adultery; and so, through such a principle as this, have
come to shame. They were found, moreover, fomenting separations from the houses of
God and of the Church; treating the Church and its members with disdain, and establishing
separate meetings and assemblies, and different doctrines and other things in opposition
to the Churches and those things which are done in the Church; wearing strange apparel,
to the destruction of the common custom of dress; making distributions, among themselves
and their adherents as saints, of the first-fruits of the Church, which have, from the first,
been given to the Church; slaves also leaving their masters, and, on account of their own
strange apparel, acting insolently towards their masters; women, too, disregarding decent
custom, and, instead of womanly apparel, wearing men’s clothes, thinking to be justified
because of these; while many of them, under a pretext of piety, cut off the growth of hair,
which is natural to woman; [and these persons were found] fasting on the Lord’s Day, despising
the sacredness of that free day, but disdaining and eating on the fasts appointed in
the Church; and certain of them abhor the eating of flesh; neither do they tolerate prayers
in the houses of married persons, but, on the contrary, despise such prayers when they are
made, and often refuse to partake when Oblations are offered in the houses of married
persons; contemning married presbyters, and refusing to touch their ministrations; condemning
the services in honour of the Martyrs149 and those who gather or minister therein,
and the rich also who do not alienate all their wealth, as having nothing to hope from God;
and many other things that no one could recount. For every one of them, when he forsook
the canon of the Church, adopted laws that tended as it were to isolation; for neither was
there any common judgment among all of them; but whatever any one conceived, that he
propounded, to the scandal of the Church, and to his own destruction.</p>
<note type="footnote">148 This list of names varies in the different mss. and versions.</note>
<note type="footnote">149 This phrase in the Greek has dropped out in Labbe, and Mansi; it is found in Zonaras, etc.</note>

<pb n="199"/>
<p>Wherefore, the Holy Synod present in Gangra was compelled, on these accounts, to
condemn them, and to set forth definitions declaring them to be cast out of the Church; but
that, if they should repent and anathematize every one of these false doctrines, then they
should be capable of restoration. And therefore the Holy Synod has particularly set forth
everything which they ought to anathematize before they are received. And if any one will
not submit to the said decrees, he shall be anathematized as a heretic, and excommunicated,
and cast out of the Church; and it will behove the bishops to observe a like rule in respect
of all who may be found with them.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</p>
<p>Anathema to him who disregards legitimate marriage.</p>
<p>When one considers how deeply the early church was impressed with those passages
of Holy Scripture which she understood to set forth the superiority of the virgin over the
married estate, it ceases to be any source of astonishment that some should have run into
the error of condemning marriage as sinful. The saying of our Blessed Lord with reference
to those who had become “eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake,”151 and those words
of St. Paul “He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well, but he that giveth her not in
marriage doeth better,”152 together with the striking passage in the Revelation of those that
were “not defiled with women for they are virgins,”153 were considered as settling the matter
for the new dispensation. The earliest writers are filled with the praises of virginity. Its superiority
underlies the allegories of the Hermes Pastor;154 St. Justin Martyr speaks of “many
men and women of sixty and seventy years of age who from their childhood have been the
disciples of Christ, and have kept themselves uncorrupted,”155 and from that time on there
is an ever-swelling tide of praise; the reader must be referred to SS. Cyprian, Athanasius,
Cyril of Jerusalem, Jerome, Augustine, etc., etc. In fact the Council of Trent (it cannot be
denied) only gave expression to the view of all Christian antiquity both East and West, when

it condemned those who denied that “it is more blessed to remain virgin or celibate than to
be joined in marriage.”156</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I., Distinc.
xxx., c. xii. (Isidore’s version), and again Dist. xxxi., c. viii. (Dionysius’s version). Gratian,
however, supposes that the canon is directed against the Manichæans and refers to the
marriage of priests, but in both matters he is mistaken, as the Roman Correctors and Van
Espen point out.</p>
<note type="footnote">156 Conc. Trid.,sessio xxiv. De Matr., can. x. It is curious to note that while Eustathius and his followers held
all marriage to be sinful, Luther (at least at one time) taught that it was a sin for anyone to remain unmarried
who could “increase and multiply!” The Synod of Gangra in this canon sets forth the unchanging position of
the Catholic Church upon this point.</note>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>If any one shall condemn him who eats flesh, which is without blood and has not been
offered to idols nor strangled, and is faithful and devout, as though the man were without
hope [of salvation] because of his eating, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</p>
<p>Anathema also to him who condemns the eating of flesh, except that of a suffocated animal
or that offered to idols.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>This canon also, like the preceding one, is not directed against the Gnostics and
Manicheans, but against an unenlightened hyper-asceticism, which certainly approaches
the Gnostic-Manichean error as to matter being Satanic. We further see that, at the time
of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things
strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their
Euchologies still show. Balsamon also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the
Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the
Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however,
thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by St. Augustine in his work Contra
Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the
heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish
and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had
lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope
Gregory the Third (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a
penance of forty days.</p>
<p>No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be
one of the undisputed Ecumenical Synods, can be of greater and more unchanging force
than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact
that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical
canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuser, like other laws.</p>

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>Anathema to him who persuades a slave to leave his master under pretence of religion.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>This canon is framed in accordance with the doctrine of the Apostle, in I. Timothy,
chapter six, verse 1. “Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.” And again
the same Apostle teaches his disciple Titus that he should “exhort servants to be obedient
unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; not
purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour
in all things.” (Titus ii. 9 and 10.)</p>

<p>This Canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars. II., Causa

<p>Anathema to him who hesitates to receive communion from presbyters joined in matrimony.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>As is well known, the ancient Church, as now the Greek Church, allowed those clergy
who married before their ordination to continue to live in matrimony. Compare what was
said above in the history of the Council of Nicæa, in connection with Paphnutius, concerning
the celibacy and marriage of priests in the ancient Church. Accordingly this canon speaks
of those clergy who have wives and live in wedlock; and Baronius, Binius, and Mitter-Müller
gave themselves useless trouble in trying to interpret it as only protecting those clergy who,
though married, have since their ordination ceased to cohabit with their wives.</p>
<p>The so-called Codex Ecclesiæ Romanæ published by Quesnel, which, however, as was
shown by the Ballerini,157 is of Gallican and not Roman origin, has not this canon, and
consequently it only mentions nineteen canons of Gangra.</p>

<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I., Dist. xxx.,

the worship of God’s true church is and always has been so common a sin, that it hardly
calls for comment; no one will forget that the Prophet Malachi complains how in his days
there were those who deemed “the table of the Lord contemptible” and said of his worship
“what a weariness is it.” (Mal. i., 7 and 13.)</p>

<p>If any one shall hold private assemblies outside of the Church, and, despising the canons,

refusing his permission, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>Whoso privately gathers a religious meeting let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Both these canons, [V. and VI.] forbid the existence of conventicles, and conventicle
services. It already appears from the second article of the Synodal Letter of Gangra, that
the Eustathians, through spiritual pride, separated themselves from the rest of the congregation,
as being the pure and holy, avoided the public worship, and held private services of
their own. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh articles of the Synodal Letter give us to understand
that the Eustathians especially avoided the public services, when married clergy officiated.
We might possibly conclude, from the words of the sixth canon: μὴ συνόντος τοῦ
πρεσβυτέρου κατὰ γνώμην τοῦ ἐπισκόπου, that no priest performed any part in their private
services; but it is more probable that the Eustathians, who did not reject the priesthood as
such, but only abhorred the married clergy, had their own unmarried clergy, and that these
officiated at their separate services. And the above-mentioned words of the canon do not
the least contradict this supposition, for the very addition of the words κατὰ γνώμην τοῦ
ἐπισκόπου indicate that the sectarian priests who performed the services of the Eustathians
had received no permission to do so from the bishop of the place. Thus did the Greek
commentators, Balsamon, etc., and likewise Van Espen, interpret this canon.</p>
<p>The meaning of this canon is very obscure. The Latin reads non conveniente presbytero,
de episcopi sententia; and Lambert translates “without the presence of a priest, with consent
of the bishop.” Hammond differs from this and renders thus, “without the concurrence of
the presbyter and the consent of the bishop.” I have translated literally and left the obscurity

<p>Pope Symmachus.</p>
<p>(In his Address to the Synod of Rome a.d. 504. Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, tom. iv., col.
1373.)</p>
<p>In the canons framed by Apostolic authority [i.e., by the authority of the Apostolic See
of Rome, cf. Ffoulkes, Smith and Cheetham, Dict. Christ. Antiq., art. Gangra] we find it
written as follows concerning the offerings of fruits which are due to the clergy of the church,
and concerning those things which are offered for the use of the poor; “If anyone shall presume,
etc.” <del>Canon VII.</del> And again at the same council, “If anyone except the bishop, etc.”
<del>Canon VIII.</del> And truly it is a crime and a great sacrilege for those whose duty it is chiefly
to guard it, that is for Christians and God-fearing men and above all for princes and rulers
of this world, to transfer and convert to other uses the wealth which has been bestowed or
left by will to the venerable Church for the remedy of their sins, or for the health and repose
of their souls.</p>
<p>Moreover, whosoever shall have no care for these, and contrary to these canons, shall
seek for, accept, or hold, or shall unjustly defend and retain the treasures given to the Church
unless he quickly repent himself shall be stricken with that anathema with which an angry
God smites souls; and to him that accepts, or gives, or possesses let there be anathema, and
the constant accompaniment of the appointed penalty. For he can have no defence to offer
before the tribunal of Christ, who nefariously without any regard to religion has scattered
the substance left by pious souls for the poor.</p>

<p>Whoso preserves virginity not on account of its beauty but because he abhors marriage,

highest Christian virtues, such as the preservation of virginity, if it does not spring from a

<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>Virginity is most beautiful of all, and continence is likewise beautiful, but only if we fol
low them for their own sake and because of the sanctification which comes from them. But
should anyone embrace virginity, because he detests marriage as impure, and keep himself
chaste, and abstains from commerce with women and marriage, because he thinks that they
are in themselves wicked, he is subjected by this canon to the penalty of anathema.</p>

<head>Canon XI.</head>
<p>If anyone shall despise those who out of faith make love-feasts and invite the brethren
in honour of the Lord, and is not willing to accept these invitations because he despises what
is done, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</p>
<p>Whoso spurns those who invite to the agape, and who when invited will not communicate
with these, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>There are few subjects upon which there has been more difference of opinion than upon
the history and significance of the Agape or Love-feasts of the Early Church. To cite here
any writers would only mislead the reader; I shall therefore merely state the main outline
of the discussion and leave every man to study the matter for himself.
All agree that these feasts are referred to by St. Jude in his Epistle, and, although Dean
Plumptre has denied it (Smith and Cheetham, Dict. Christ. Antiq., s.v. Agapæ), most writers
add St. Paul in the First Epistle to the Corinthians xi. Estius (in loc.) argues with great cogency
that the expression “Lord’s Supper” in Holy Scripture never means the Holy Eucharist, but
the love-feast, and in this view he has been followed by many moderns, but the prevalent
opinion has been the opposite.</p>
<p>There is also much discussion as to the order in which the Agapæ and the celebrations
of the Holy Sacrament were related, some holding that the love-feast preceded, others that
it followed the Divine Mysteries. There seems no doubt that in early times the two became
separated, the Holy Sacrament being celebrated in the morning and the Agapæ in the
evening.</p>
<p>All agree that these feasts were at first copies of the religious feasts common to the Jews
and to the heathen world, and that soon abuses of one sort or another came in, so that they
fell into ill repute and were finally prohibited at the Council in Trullo. This canon of Gangra
is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I., Dist. xlii., c. i.</p>
<p>Van Espen is of opinion that the Agapæ of our canon have no real connexion with the
religious feasts of earlier days, but were merely meals provided by the rich for the poor, and
with this view Hefele agrees. But the matter is by no means plain. In fact at every point we
are met with difficulties and uncertainties.</p>
<p>There would seem to be little doubt that the “pain beni” of the French Church, and the
“Antidoron” of the Eastern Church are remains of the ancient Agapæ.

<p>The βήροι (lacernæ) were the common upper garments worn by men over the tunic;
but the περιβόλαια were rough mantles worn by philosophers to show their contempt for
all luxury. Socrates (H. E., ii. 43) and the Synodal Letter of Gangra in its third article say
that Eustathius of Sebaste wore the philosopher’s mantle. But this canon in no way absolutely
rejects a special dress for monks, for it is not the distinctive dress but the proud and superstitious
over-estimation of its worth which the Synod here blames.</p>

<p>Whatever women wear men’s clothes, anathema to them.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The synodal letter in its sixth article also speaks of this. Exchange of dress, or the adoption
by one sex of the dress of the other, was forbidden in the Pentateuch (Deut. xxii. 5),
and was therefore most strictly interdicted by the whole ancient Church. Such change of
attire was formerly adopted mainly for theatrical purposes, or from effeminacy, wantonness,
the furtherance of unchastity, or the like. The Eustathians, from quite opposite and hyperascetical
reasons, had recommended women to assume male, that is probably monk’s attire,
in order to show that for them, as the holy ones, there was no longer any distinction of sex;
but the Church, also from ascetical reasons, forbade this change of attire, especially when
joined to superstition and puritanical pride.</p>

<p>If any woman shall forsake her husband, and resolve to depart from him because she

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</p>
<p>Women who keep away from their husbands because they abominate marriage, anathema
to them.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>This canon cannot in any way be employed in opposition to the practice of the Catholic
Church. For though the Church allows one of a married couple, with the consent of the
other, to give up matrimonial intercourse, and to enter the clerical order or the cloister, still
this is not, as is the case with the Eustathians, the result of a false dogmatic theory, but takes
place with a full recognition of the sanctity of marriage.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>It would seem that the Eustathians chiefly disapproved of the use of marriage, and under
pretext of preserving continence induced married women to abstain from its use as from
something unlawful, and to leave their husbands, separating from them so far as the bed
was concerned; and so the Greek interpreters understand this canon; for the Eustathians
were never accused of persuading anyone to dissolve a marriage a vinculo.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I., Dist, xxx.,
c. iii., but in Isidore’s version, which misses the sense by implying that a divorce a vinculo
is intended. The Roman Correctors do not note this error.</p>

<p>Whosoever they be that desert their children and do not instruct them in the fear of God
let them be anathema.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The fathers of this Synod here teach that it is the office and duty of parents to provide
for the bodily care of their children, and also, as far as in them lies, to mould them to the
practice of piety. And this care for their children is to be preferred by parents to any private
exercises of religion. In this connexion should be read the letter of St. Francis de Sales. (Ep.
xxxii, Lib. 4.)</p>
<p>It may perhaps be noted that this canon has not infrequently been violated by those
who are accepted as Saints in the Church.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.</p>
<p>If children leave their parents who are of the faithful let them be anathema.</p>
<p>Zonaras notes that the use of the word “particularly” shews that the obligation is universal.

by which the Jews under pretext of piety defrauded their parents and made the law
of God of none effect.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Of the last clause this is the meaning; that according to the Eustathians “piety towards
God” or “divine worship,” or rather its pretence, should be preferred to the honour and
reverence due to parents.</p>

<p>If any woman from pretended asceticism shall cut off her hair, which God gave her as

<p>Whatever women shave their hair off, pretending to do so out of reverence for God, let

<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, xi. 10, represents the long hair
of women, which is given them as a natural veil, as a token of their subjection to man. We
learn from the Synod of Gangra, that as many Eustathian women renounced this subjection,
and left their husbands, so, as this canon says, they also did away with their long hair, which
was the outward token of this subjection. An old proverb says: duo si faciunt idem, non est
idem. In the Catholic Church also, when women and girls enter the cloister, they have their
hair cut off, but from quite other reasons than those of the Eustathian women. The former
give up their hair, because it has gradually become the custom to consider the long hair of
women as a special beauty, as their greatest ornament; but the Eustathians, like the ancient
Church in general, regarded long hair as the token of subjection to the husband, and, because
they renounced marriage and forsook their husbands, they cut it off.</p>

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.</p>
<p>Whoso fasts on the Lord’s day or on the Sabbath let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>Eustathius appointed the Lord’s day as a fast, whereas, because Christ rose from the
grave and delivered human nature from sin on that day, we should spend it in offering joyous
thanks to God. But fasting carries with it the idea of grief and sorrow. For this reason those
who fast on Sunday are subjected to the punishment of anathema.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>By many canons we are warned against fasting or grieving on the festal and joyous
Lord’s day, in remembrance of the resurrection of the Lord; but that we should celebrate it
and offer thanks to God, that we be raised from the fall of sin. But this canon smites the
Eustathians with anathema because they taught that the Lord’s days should be fasted.
Canon LXIV. of the Apostolic Canons cuts off such of the laity as shall so fast, and deposes
such of the clergy. See also Canon LV. of the Council in Trullo.</p>

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</p>
<p>Whoso neglects the fasts of the Church, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>I have followed Hefele’s translation of the last clause, with which Van Espen seems to
agree, as well as Zonaras. But Hardouin and Mansi take an entirely different view and
translate “if the Eustathian deliberately rejects the Church fasts.” Zonoras and Balsamon
both refer to the LXIXth of the Apostolical Canons as being the law the Eustathians violated.
Balsamon suggests that the Eustathians shared the error of the Bogomiles on the subject of
fasting, but I see no reason to think that this was the case; Eustathius’s action seems rather
to be attributable to pride, and a desire to be different and original, “I thank thee that I am
not as other men are,” (as Van Espen points out). All that Socrates says (H. E. II., xliii.) is
that “he commanded that the prescribed fasts should be neglected, and that the Lord’s days
should be fasted.”</p>

<p>If any one shall, from a presumptuous disposition, condemn and abhor the assemblies

them, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.</p>
<p>Whoever thinks lightly of the meetings in honour of the holy martyrs, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Van Espen is of opinion that the Eustathians had generally rejected the common service
as only fit for the less perfect, and that the martyr chapels are only mentioned here, because
in old times service was usually held there. According to this view, no especial weight need
be attached to the expression. But this canon plainly speaks of a disrespect shown by the
Eustathians to the martyrs. Compare the twelfth article of the Synodal Letter. Fuchs thought
that, as the Eustathians resembled the Aerians, who rejected the service for the dead, the
same views might probably be ascribed to the Eustathians. But, in the first place, the Aerians
are to be regarded rather as opposed than related in opinion to the Eustathians, being lax
in contrast to these ultra-rigorists. Besides which, Epiphanius only says that they rejected
prayer for the salvation of the souls of the departed, but not that they did not honour the
martyrs; and there is surely a great difference between a feast in honour of a saint, and a
requiem for the good of a departed soul. Why, however, the Eustathians rejected the veneration
of martyrs is nowhere stated; perhaps because they considered themselves as saints,
κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν, exalted above the martyrs, who were for the most part only ordinary Christians,
and many of whom had lived in marriage, while according to Eustathian views no married
person could be saved, or consequently could be an object of veneration.</p>
<p>Lastly, it must be observed that the first meaning of σύναξις, is an assembly for divine
service, or the service itself; but here it seems to be taken to mean συναγωγή the place of
worship, so that the συνάξεις τῶν μαρτύρων seems to be identical with martyria, and different
from the λειτουργίαι held in them, of which the latter words of the canon speak.</p>

<head>Epilogue.</head>
<p>These things we write, not to cut off those who wish to lead in the Church of God an
ascetic life, according to the Scriptures; but those who carry the pretence of asceticism to
superciliousness; both exalting themselves above those who live more simply, and introducing
novelties contrary to the Scriptures and the ecclesiastical Canons. We do, assuredly, admire
virginity accompanied by humility; and we have regard for continence, accompanied by
godliness and gravity; and we praise the leaving of worldly occupations, [when it is made]
with lowliness of mind; [but at the same time] we honour the holy companionship of marriage,
and we do not contemn wealth enjoyed with uprightness and beneficence; and we
commend plainness and frugality in apparel, [which is worn] only from attention, [and
that] not over-fastidious, to the body; but dissolute and effeminate excess in dress we eschew;
and we reverence the houses of God and embrace the assemblies held therein as holy and
helpful, not confining religion within the houses, but reverencing every place built in the
name of God; and we approve of gathering together in the Church itself for the common
profit; and we bless the exceeding charities done by the brethren to the poor, according to
the traditions of the Church; and, to sum up in a word, we wish that all things which have
been delivered by the Holy Scriptures and the Apostolical traditions, may be observed in
the Church.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>This is lacking in the ancient epitome; and while it occurs after Canon XX. in the versions
of Dionysius Exiguus and of Isidore Mercator, it is not numbered as a canon. Moreover in
John of Antioch’s Collection and in Photius’s Nomocanon, the number of canons is said to
be 20. Only the Greek Scholiasts number it as Canon XXI., but its genuineness is unquestioned.

<p>The Fathers of Gangra recognize not only the Holy Scriptures, but also the Apostolical

<p>From this <del>canon</del> it is by no means doubtful that the fathers of this Synod considered
that the Eustathians had violated some already existing ecclesiastical canons. Beveridge is
of opinion that these are those commonly called the Canons of the Apostles (Synod. I. 5).
Nor is this unlikely to be true, for there can be no doubt that the doctrines of the Eustathians
condemned by this synod are directly opposed to those very “Canons of the Apostles”; and
no small argument is drawn for the authority and antiquity of the Canons of the Apostles

<pb n="226"/>
<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>Of the Synod of Antioch which adopted the canons subsequently received into the code
of the universal church we know the exact date. This is fixed by the fact that the synod was
held at the time of the dedication of the great church in Antioch, known as the “Golden,”
which had been begun by his father, Constantine the Great, and was finished in the days of
Constantius. The synod has for this reason always been known as the Synod of Antioch in
Encæniis, i.e., at the dedication (in Dedicatione), and was holden in the summer of the year
341. Ninety-seven bishops assembled together and a large number of them were hostile to
St. Athanasius, being professed Eusebians, all of them were Orientals and most of them belonged
to the patriarchate of Antioch. Not a single Western or Latin bishop was present
and the pope, Julius, was in no way represented. This fact gave Socrates the historian the
opportunity of making the statement (around which such polemics have raged), that “an
ecclesiastical canon commands that the churches should not make decrees against the
opinion of the bishop of Rome.”160</p>
<p>But while this much is all clear, there is no council that presents a greater amount of
difficulty to the historian as well as to the theologian. No one can deny that St. Hilary of
Poictiers, who was a contemporary, styled it a Synod of Saints (Synodus Sanctorum)161;
that two of its canons were read at Chalcedon as the “canons of the Holy Fathers”; and that
Popes John II., Zacharias, and Leo. IV. all approved these canons, and attributed them to
“Holy Fathers.” And yet this synod set forth creeds to rival that of Nice, and, it is said, that
some of the canons were adopted to condemn Athanasius.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made to escape from these difficulties.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that there really were two Synods at Antioch, the one orthodox,
which adopted the canons, the other heretical.</p>
<p>Father Emanuel Schelstraten, S. J.162 improved on this theory. He supposed that the
Eusebians stopped behind in Antioch after the orthodox bishops left and then passed the
decrees against Athanasius, giving out that the synod was still in session. This has been
adopted by Pagi, Remi Ceillier, Walch, and to a certain extent by Schröckh and others. But
Tillemont demurs to this view, urging that according to Socrates163 the deposition of Athanasius
came first and the adoption of the canons afterwards. But Tillemont would seem
<note type="footnote">160 Socrates. H. E., Lib. II., cap. viij. Hefele thinks the statement may rest upon nothing more than the letter
of Julius I. that the matter should first have been referred to Rome (Hefele. Hist. Councils, Vol. II., p. 59, n. 2).
But the word used by Socrates is κανών!</note>
<note type="footnote">161 Hilar. Pict. De Synodis, seu de Fide Orient., C. xxxii. Ed. Ben., 1170.</note>

<note type="footnote">163 Socrates. H. E., Lib. II., Cap. viij.</note>

<pb n="227"/>
to have misunderstood Socrates on this point and this objection falls to the ground. But
another objection remains, viz., that both Socrates and Sozomen say that the creeds were
drawn up after the deposition of Athanasius, “and yet” (as Hefele remarks, Vol. II., p. 63),
“St. Hilary says that these creeds proceeded from a ‘Synod of Saints.’”</p>
<p>Schelstraten’s hypothesis not being satisfactory, the learned Ballerini, in their appendix
to the Opera S. Leonis M., have set forth another theory with which Mansi agrees in his
“Notes on Alexander Natalis’s Church History.” These maintain that the canons did not
come from the Council in Encæniis at all, but from another synod held before, in 332; but
Hefele rejects this hypothesis altogether, on the following grounds. First and chiefest because
it has no external evidence to support it; and secondly because the internal evidence is most
unsatisfactory. But even if the 25 canons were adopted by a synod at Antioch in 332, the
real difficulty would not be obviated, for Socrates says164 of that synod that there too the
“opposers of the Nicene faith” were able to elect their candidate to fill the place of the banished
bishop Eustathius!</p>
<p>Hefele seems to give the true solution of the whole difficulty when he says: “Certainly
Athanasius identified the Eusebians with the Arians and we regard them as at least Semiarians;
but at that time, after they had made the orthodox confession of faith, and repeatedly
declared their disapproval of the heresies condemned at Nice, they were considered, by the
greater number, as lawful bishops, and thoroughly orthodox and saintly men might without
hesitation unite with them at a synod.”165</p>
<p>Pope Julius styles the very Eusebian synod that deposed Athanasius “dear brethren”
while blaming their action, and invited them to a common synod to enquire into the charges
made against the Saint. In view of all this we may well believe that both orthodox and Eusebians
met together at the consecration of the Emperor’s new church, and that the whole
church afterwards awarded the canons then adopted a rank in accordance with their intrinsic
worth, and without any regard to the motives or shades of theological opinion that swayed
those who drafted and voted for them.</p>

<head>Canon I.</head>
<p>Whosoever shall presume to set aside the decree of the holy and great Synod which was
assembled at Nice in the presence of the pious Emperor Constantine, beloved of God, concerning
the holy and salutary feast of Easter; if they shall obstinately persist in opposing
what was [then] rightly ordained, let them be excommunicated and cast out of the Church;
this is said concerning the laity. But if any one of those who preside in the Church, whether
he be bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall presume, after this decree, to exercise his own
private judgment to the subversion of the people and to the disturbance of the churches, by
observing Easter [at the same time] with the Jews, the holy Synod decrees that he shall
thenceforth be an alien from the Church, as one who not only heaps sins upon himself, but
who is also the cause of destruction and subversion to many; and it deposes not only such
persons themselves from their ministry, but those also who after their deposition shall presume
to communicate with them. And the deposed shall be deprived even of that external
honour, of which the holy Canon and God’s priesthood partake.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</p>
<p>Whoso endeavours to change the lawful tradition of Easter, if he be a layman let him be
excommunicated, but if a cleric let him be cast out of the Church.</p>
<p>The connexion between these canons of Antioch and the Apostolical Canons is so
evident and so intimate that I shall note it, in each case, for the convenience of the student.
Zonaras and Balsamon both point out that from this first canon it is evident that the
Council of Nice did take action upon the Paschal question, and in a form well known to the
Church.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>From this canon it appears that the fathers did not deem laymen deserving of excommunication
who merely broke the decrees, but only those who “obstinately persist in opposing
the decrees sanctioned and received by the Church; for by their refusal to obey they are at-

Antioch.” The Bodleian ms. reads “Canons of the Synod at Antioch in Syria.”</note>

tempting to overturn.” And this being the case, why should such not be repelled or cast
forth from the Church as rebels?</p>
<p>Finally this Canon proves that not only bishops and presbyters, but also deacons were
reckoned among them who, “preside in the Church.” An argument in favour of the opinion
that the deacons of that time were entrusted with hierarchical functions.</p>
<p>It is curious that as a matter of fact the entire clergy and people of the West fell under
the anathema of this canon in 1825, when they observed Easter on the same day as the Jews.
This was owing to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and this misfortune while that
calendar is followed it is almost impossible to prevent.168</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>All who enter the church of God and hear the Holy Scriptures, but do not communicate
with the people in prayers, or who turn away, by reason of some disorder, from the holy
partaking of the Eucharist, are to be cast out of the Church, until, after they shall have made
confession, and having brought forth the fruits of penance, and made earnest entreaty, they
shall have obtained forgiveness; and it is unlawful to communicate with excommunicated
persons, or to assemble in private houses and pray with those who do not pray in the Church;
or to receive in one Church those who do not assemble with another Church. And, if any
one of the bishops, presbyters, or deacons, or any one in the Canon shall be found communicating
with excommunicated persons, let him also be excommunicated, as one who brings
confusion on the order of the Church.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</p>
<p>Whoso comes to church, and attentively hears the holy Scriptures, and then despises, goes
forth from, and turns his back upon the Communion, let him be cast out, until after having
brought forth fruits of penance, he shall be indulged. And whoso communicates with one excommunicated,
shall be excommunicated, and whoso prays with him who prays not with the
Church is guilty, and even whoso receives him who does not attend the services of the Church
is not without guilt.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>In the Eighth and Ninth canons of the Apostles it is set forth how those are to be punished
who will not wait for the prayers, and the holy Communion: So, too, in the Tenth canon
provision is made with respect to those who communicate with the excommunicated. In
pursuance of this the present canon provides that they are to be cut off who come to church
and do not wait for the prayer, and through disorder [? ἀταξίαν]169 will not receive the holy
Communion; for such are to be cast out until with confession they shew forth worthy penance.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<note type="footnote">169 I confess I do not know what the phrase κατά τινα ἀταξίαν means, nor do the Greek Commentators give
much help. I have translated “by reason of some disorder” in the canon itself, and in the notes, but Beveridge
renders it propter aliquam insolentiam, which to me appears very unsatisfactory. The pro quædam intemperantia
of the ordinary Latin seems no better. The same word is used in the next canon.</note>

<pb n="232"/>
<p>In this canon the Fathers refer to such as go to church but will not tarry to the prayer
nor receive holy Communion, held back by some perversity or license, that is to say without
any just cause, but petulantly, and by reason of some disorder [ἀταξίαν]; these are forbidden
to be expelled from the Church, that is to say cut off from the congregation of the faithful.
But the Fathers call it a turning away from, not a hatred of the divine Communion, which
holds them back from communion; a certain kind of flight from it, brought about perchance
by reverence and lowliness of mind. Those who object to communicate by reason of hatred
or disgust, such must be punished not with mere separation, but by an altogether absolute
excommunication, and be cursed with anathema.</p>
<p>It need hardly be remarked that this canon has no reference to such of the faithful as
tarry to the end of the service and yet do not partake of the holy sacrament, being held back
by some good reason, recognized by the Church as such. It will be remembered that the
highest grade of Penitents did this habitually, and that it was looked upon as a great privilege
to be allowed to be present when the Divine Mysteries were performed, even though those
assisting as spectators might not be partakers of them. What this canon condemns is leaving
the Church before the service of the Holy Eucharist is done; this much is clear, the difficulty
is to understand just why these particular people, against whom the canon is directed, did
so.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</p>
<p>If a bishop deposed by a synod shall dare to celebrate the liturgy, let him have no chance
of return.</p>
<p>This canon derives its chief interest from the fact that it is usually considered to have
been adopted at the instigation of the party opposed to St. Athanasius and that afterwards
it was used against St. Chrysostom. But while such may have been the secret reason why
some voted for it and others prized it, it must be remembered that its provision is identical
with that of the Apostolic Canons, and that it was read at the Council of Chalcedon as
Canon eighty-three. Remi Ceillier (Histoire Genéral des Autheurs, p. 659) tries to prove that
this is not the canon which St. Chrysostom and his friends rejected, but Hefele thinks his
position “altogether untenable” (Hist. of the Councils, Vol. II., p. 62, n. 1), and refers to
Tillemont (Mémoires, p. 329, Sur les Arians, and Fuchs’ Bib. der Kirchenversammlungen, P.
II., p. 59.171)</p>
<p>Compare Apostolic Canon xxviij.</p>
<p>This canon is found twice in the Juris Corpus Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars II.,
Causa XI., Quæst. III., Can. vj., and Can. vij. in the version of Martin Bracarensis. This
version is very interesting as expanding the phrase “to execute any part of the ministry” into
“to make the oblation, or to perform the morning or evening sacrifice as though he were in
office just as before, etc.”</p>
<note type="footnote">171 Hefele on the preceding page (p. 61, n. 1) says “Of course the sentence or canon to which the adversaries
of Chrysostom referred must be distinguished from the fourth and twelfth true Antiochian canons. It seems
somewhat difficult to reconcile this with what I have cited above, and with the following (p. 65): “In the affair
of St. Chrysostom the canon employed against him was represented as proceeding from the Arians, and all attempts
to deny its identity with our fourth and twelfth Antiochian canons are fruitless.”</note>

a first and a second time, let such an one be wholly deposed and have no further remedy,
neither be capable of regaining his rank. And if he persist in troubling and disturbing the

<p>It will be noted that the Ancient Epitome mentions three warnings, and the canon only
two. The epitome in this evidently follows the Apostolical Canon, number thirty-one. It
is somewhat curious that Aristenus in commenting on this canon does not note the discrepancy.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>This canon, together with the preceding was read from the Code of Canons at the
Council of Chalcedon, at the Fourth Session in connexion with the case of Carosus and
Dorothoeus, and of other monks who adhered to them. And a sentence in accordance with
them was conceived in these words against those who would not obey the Council in the
condemnation of Eutyches, “Let them know that they together with the monks who are with
them, are deprived of grade, and of all dignity, and of communion, as well as he, so that
they cease to preside over their monasteries: and if they attempt to escape, this holy and
universal great council decrees the same punishment shall attach to them, that is to say the
external authority, according to the divine and holy laws of the Fathers, shall carry out the
sentence passed against the contumacious.”</p>
<p>This canon shews that monks and clerics who were rebellious were sometimes coerced
by the Secular Power, when the ecclesiastical power was not sufficient to coerce them, and
hence it was that the secular arm was called in.</p>

<head>Canon VIII.</head>
<p>Let not country presbyters give letters canonical, or let them send such letters only to
the neighbouring bishops. But the chorepiscopi of good report may give letters pacifical.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</p>
<p>A country presbyter is not to give canonical letters, or [at most] only to a neighbouring
bishop.</p>
<p>These “letters canonical” were called in the West letters “formatæ,” and no greater proof
of the great influence they had in the early days of the Church in binding the faithful together
can be found than the fact that Julian the Apostate made an attempt to introduce something
similar among the pagans of his empire.</p>
<p>“Commendatory letters” (ἐπιστολαὶ συστατικαὶ) are spoken of by St. Paul in 2 Cor. iii.
1, and the reader will find some interesting remarks on this and cognate subjects in J. J.
Blunt’s, The Christian Church during the first three Centuries (Chapter II).</p>
<p>By means of these letters even the lay people found hospitality and care in every part of
the world, and it was thrown up against the Donatists as a mark of their being schismatics
that their canonical letters were good only among themselves.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Isidore informs us that it was stated at the Council of Chalcedon by Atticus,
bishop of Constantinople, that it was agreed at the Council of Nice that all such letters should
be marked Π. Υ. Α. Π. (i.e. Father, Son, Holy Spirit), and it is asserted (Herzog, Real-Encyk.,
s.v. Literæ Formatæ) that this form is found in German documents of the sixth century.</p>
<p>As will be seen among the Canons of Chalcedon, the old name, Letters Commendatory,
is continued, but in this canon and in the 41st of Laodicea the expression “Canonical Letters”
is used. In the West, at least, these letters received the episcopal seal of the diocese to avoid
all possibility of imposture. Dean Plumptre (whom I am following very closely in this note)
believes the earliest evidence of this use of the diocesan seal is in Augustine (Epist. lix. al.
ccxvij.) He also refers to Ducange, s.v. Formatæ.</p>
<p>As these letters admitted their bearers to communion they were sometimes called
“Communion letters” (κοινωνικαὶ ), and are so described by St. Cyril of Alexandria; and
by the Council of Elvira (canon xxv.), and by St. Augustine (Epist. xliii. al. clxii).</p>
<p>The “Letters Pacifical” appear to have been of an eleemosynary character, so that the
bearers of them obtained bodily help. Chalcedon in its eleventh canon ordains these “Letters
pacifical” shall be given to the poor, whether they be clerics or laics. The same expression
is used in the preceding canon of the synod.</p>

<pb n="240"/>
<p>A later form of ecclesiastical letter is that with which we are so familiar, the “letter dimissory.”
This expression first occurs in Canon XVII. of the Council in Trullo. On this
expression Suicer (Thesaurus, s.v. ἀπολυτικὴ) draws from the context the conclusion that
“letters dimissory” were given only for permanent change of ecclesiastical residence, while,
“letters commendatory” were given to those whose absence from their diocese was only
temporary.</p>

<head>Canon IX.</head>
<p>It behoves the bishops in every province to acknowledge the bishop who presides in the
metropolis, and who has to take thought for the whole province; because all men of business
come together from every quarter to the metropolis. Wherefore it is decreed that he have
precedence in rank, and that the other bishops do nothing extraordinary without him, (according
to the ancient canon which prevailed from [the times of] our Fathers) or such things
only as pertain to their own particular parishes and the districts subject to them. For each
bishop has authority over his own parish, both to manage it with the piety which is incumbent
on every one, and to make provision for the whole district which is dependent on his city;
to ordain presbyters and deacons; and to settle everything with judgment. But let him undertake
nothing further without the bishop of the metropolis; neither the latter without the
consent of the others.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</p>
<p>Bishops should be bound to the opinion of the metropolitan, and nothing should they do
without his knowledge except only such things as have reference to the diocese of each, and let
them ordain men free from blame.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>From this canon we see that causes of more importance and greater moment are to be
considered in the Provincial Synod which consisted of the metropolitan and the other
bishops of the province.</p>
<p>By the “ancient canon” of which mention is here made, there can scarcely be a doubt is
intended the xxxiv. of the Canons of the Apostles, since in it are read the same provisions
(and almost in the same words) as here are set forth somewhat more at length; nor is there
any other canon in which these provisions are found earlier in date than this synod,
wherefore from this is deduced a strong argument for the integrity of the Canons of the
Apostles.</p>
<p>The wording of this canon should be compared with the famous sentence so often
quoted of St. Irenæus. “Ad hanc enim ecclesiam <del>i.e. of Rome</del> propter potentiorem principalitatem
necesse est omnem convenire ecclesiam, hoc est, eos qui sunt undique fideles,
in quâ semper ab his, qui sunt undique, conservata est eaque est ab Apostolis traditio.”</p>
<p>Is it not likely that in the lost Greek original the words translated convenire ad were
συντρέχειν ἐν? Vide on the meaning of convenire ad, F. W. Puller, The Primitive Saints
and the See of Rome, pp. 32 et seqq.</p>

<p>The Holy Synod decrees that persons in villages and districts, or those who are called
chorepiscopi, even though they may have received ordination to the Episcopate, shall regard
their own limits and manage the churches subject to them, and be content with the care
and administration of these; but they may ordain readers, sub-deacons and exorcists, and
shall be content with promoting these, but shall not presume to ordain either a presbyter
or a deacon, without the consent of bishop of the city to which he and his district are subject.
And if he shall dare to transgress [these] decrees, he shall be deposed from the rank which
he enjoys. And a chorepiscopus is to be appointed by the bishop of the city to which he is
subject.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon X.</p>
<p>A chorepiscopus makes Exorcists, Lectors, Subdeacons and Singers, but not a presbyter
or a deacon without the bishop of the city. Who dares to transgress this law let him be deposed.
The bishop of the city makes the chorepiscopus.</p>
<p>For the Minor Orders in the Early Church see the Excursus on the subject appended to
Canon XXIV. of Laodicea.</p>
<p>“Ordination to the episcopate.” In translating thus I have followed both Dionysius and
Isidore, the former of whom translates “although they had received the imposition of the
hand of the bishop and had been consecrated bishops;” and the latter “although they had
received from bishops the imposition of the hand, and had been consecrated bishops.”</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the Chorepiscopi, the authority of whom is limited by this
canon, are supposed to be endowed with the episcopal character. Among the learned there
is a controversy as to whether Chorepiscopi were true bishops by virtue of the ordination
to that office, and endowed with the episcopal character or were only bishops when accidentally
so. But whatever may be the merits of this controversy, there can be no doubt from the
context of this canon that the Fathers of Antioch took it for granted that the chorepiscopi
were true bishops by virtue of their ordination, but it is also evident that they were subject
to the bishop of the greater city. It must also be noted that these chorepiscopi were not in-

<pb n="244"/>
stituted by the canons of the Councils of Ancyra, Neocæsarea, or even of Nice, for these
speak of them and make their decrees as concerning something already existing.</p>
<p>And from the very limitations of this canon it is by no means obscure that the fathers
of Antioch supposed these chorepiscopi to be real bishops, for otherwise even with the license
of the bishop of the city they could not ordain presbyters or deacons.</p>

<p>This canon is one of those magnificent efforts which the early church made to check
the already growing inclination to what we have in later times learned to call Erastianism.
Not only did the State, as soon as it became Christian, interfere in spiritual matters at its
own motion, but there were found bishops and others of the clergy who not being able to
attain their ends otherwise, appealed to the civil power, usually to the Emperor himself, and
thus the whole discipline of the Church was threatened, and the authority of spiritual synods
set aside. How unsuccessful the Church often was in this struggle is only too evident from
the remarks of the Greek commentator Balsamon on this very canon.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Kellner (Das Buss. und Strafversahren, p. 61) remarks with reference to this, that deposition
is here treated as a heavier punishment than exclusion from communion, and therefore
the latter cannot mean actual excommunication but only suspension.</p>

<head>Canon XIV.</head>
<p>If a bishop shall be tried on any accusations, and it should then happen that the bishops
of the province disagree concerning him, some pronouncing the accused innocent, and
others guilty; for the settlement of all disputes, the holy Synod decrees that the metropolitan
call on some others belonging to the neighbouring province, who shall add their judgment
and resolve the dispute, and thus, with those of the province, confirm what is determined.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</p>
<p>If the bishops of the province disagree among themselves as to an accused bishop, that the
controversy may be certainly settled, let other neighbouring bishops be called in.
Zonaras.</p>
<p>When any bishop shall have been condemned with unanimous consent by all the bishops
of the province, the condemnation cannot be called into doubt, as this synod has set forth
in its fourth canon. But if all the bishops are not of the same mind, but some contend that
he should be condemned and others the contrary, then other bishops may be called in by
the metropolitan from the neighbouring provinces, and when their votes are added to one
or other of the parties among the bishops, then controversy should be brought to a close.
This also is the law of the Synod of Sardica, canons iii. and v.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>Every bishop accused of crimes should be judged by his own synod, but if the bishops
of the province differ, some saying that he is innocent and some that he is guilty, the metropolitan
can call other bishops from a neighbouring province that they may solve the controversy
agitated by the bishops.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars II., Causa
vi., Quæst. iv., can. j. The Roman Correctors note that the Latin translation implies that
the neighbouring metropolitan is to be invited and say, “But, in truth, it hardly seems fitting
that one metropolitan should come at the call of another, and that there should be two
metropolitans in one synod.”</p>

<head>Canon XV.</head>
<p>If any bishop, lying under any accusation, shall be judged by all the bishops in the
province, and all shall unanimously deliver the same verdict concerning him, he shall not
be again judged by others, but the unanimous sentence of the bishops of the province shall
stand firm.</p>

<p>If all the bishops of a province agree with regard to a bishop already sentenced, a new
trial shall not be granted him.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>By the phrase “by others” must be understood bishops called from a neighbouring
province, of which mention is made in the previous canon, where in the case of an agreement
among the bishops, the synod did not wish to be called in, even if it were demanded by the
condemned bishop. This canon, therefore, is a supplement as it were to the preceding. And
for this reason in the Breviarium and in Cresconius’s Collection of Canons they are placed
under a common title, cap. 144, “Concerning the difference of opinion which happens in
the judgment of bishops, or when a bishop is cut off by all the bishops of his province.”</p>
<p>From these canons it is manifest that at first the causes of bishops were agitated and
decided in provincial synods, and this discipline continued for many centuries, and was
little by little departed from in the VIIIth and IXth centuries.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars II., Causa
VI., Quæst. IV., Can. v. Gratian adds a note which Van Espen remarks smacks of his own
date rather than of that of the Synod of Antioch.</p>

<p>If any one having received the ordination of a bishop, and having been appointed to

him.</p>

<p>If any one called to the rule of the people refuse to undertake that office and ministry,
let him be removed from communion, that is separated, until he accept the position. But
should he persist in his refusal, he can by no means be absolved from his separation, unless
perchance the full synod shall take some action in his case. For it is possible that he may
assign reasonable causes why he should be excused from accepting the prelature offered
him, reasons which would meet with the approbation of the synod.
Balsamon explains the canon in the same sense and adds that by “ordination” here is
intended ordination proper, not merely election, as some have held.

<p>In canon xvij. the fathers punished him who when ordained could not be persuaded to
go to the church to which he was assigned. In the present canon they grant pardon to him
who is willing to take the charge of the diocese, for which he was consecrated, but is prevented
from doing so by the impudence of the people or else by the incursions of the infidel; and
therefore they allow him to enjoy, in whatever province he may happen to be, the honour
due his rank, viz., his throne, his title, and the exercise of the episcopal office, with the
knowledge and consent of the bishop of the diocese. He must not, however, meddle with
the affairs of the church of which he is a guest, that is to say he must not teach, nor ordain,
nor perform any episcopal act without the consent of the bishop of the diocese; but he must
observe quiet, until he learns what he ought to do by the determination of the full Synod.
Aristenus explains that by keeping quiet is intended that he should not “use any military
help or other power.”</p>

<head>Canon XIX.</head>
<p>A bishop shall not be ordained without a synod and the presence of the metropolitan
of the province. And when he is present, it is by all means better that all his brethren in the
ministry of the Province should assemble together with him; and these the metropolitan
ought to invite by letter. And it were better that all should meet; but if this be difficult, it is
indispensable that a majority should either be present or take part by letter in the election,
and that thus the appointment should be made in the presence, or with the consent, of the
majority; but if it should be done contrary to these decrees, the ordination shall be of no
force. And if the appointment shall be made according to the prescribed canon, and any
should object through natural love of contradiction, the decision of the majority shall prevail.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</p>
<p>If there be no synod and metropolitan, let there be no bishop. If on account of some difficulty
all do not meet together, at least let the greater number, or let them give their assent by
letter. But if after the affair is all settled a few are contentious, let the vote of the majority
stand firm.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>In the first place it must be noted that by “ordination” in this place is meant election,
and the laying on of the bishop’s hand.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>The method of choosing a bishop is laid down in the canons of Nice, number iv., but
the present canon adds the provision that an election which takes place in violation of the
provisions of this decree is null and invalid: and that when those who are electing are divided
in opinion as to whom to choose, the votes of the majority shall prevail. But when you hear
this canon saying that there should be no election without the presence of the Metropolitan,
you must not say that he ought to be present at an election (for this was prohibited, as is
found written in other canons) but rather say that his presence here is a permission or persuasion,
without which no election could take place.</p>

on the ides of October which is the tenth [or fifteenth] day of the month Hyperberetæus;
so that presbyters and deacons, and all who think themselves unjustly dealt with, may resort

<p>The time fixed by the Council of Nice before Lent for the meeting of the synod was not
received in the East, and the bishops kept on in the old custom of celebrating the council
in the fourth week after Easter, for the time before Lent often presented the greatest difficulties
for those in the far separated cities to come to the provincial metropolis.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>In this canon the decree of Nice in canon v. is renewed, but with this difference that the
Nicene synod orders one synod to be held before Lent, but this synod that it should be held
the fourth week after Easter.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the whole period of the great fifty days from Easter to
Whitsunday was known as “Pentecost.”</p>

<head>Canon XXII.</head>
<p>Let not a bishop go to a strange city, which is not subject to himself, nor into a district
which does not belong to him, either to ordain any one, or to appoint presbyters or deacons
to places within the jurisdiction of another bishop, unless with the consent of the proper
bishop of the place. And if any one shall presume to do any such thing, the ordination shall
be void, and he himself shall be punished by the synod.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.</p>
<p>A bishop shall not go from city to city ordaining people, except by the will of the bishop
of the city: otherwise the ordination shall be without force, and he himself exposed to censure.</p>
<p>If we do not draw a rash conclusion, we should say that the interference of bishops in
dioceses not their own, must have been very frequent in early days. This one synod enacted
two canons (number XIII. and this present canon) on the subject. The same prohibition is
found in canons XIV. and XXXV. of the Apostolic canons, in canon XV. of Nice, canon ij.
of I. Constantinople and in many others. On account of the similarity of this canon to
canon xiii. some have supposed it to be spurious, the enactment of some other synod, and
this was the opinion of Godefrides Hermantius (Vita S. Athanasii, Lib. IV., cap. xij.) as well
as of Alexander Natalis (Hist. Soec., IV., Dissert. xxv.). Van Espen, however, is of opinion
that the two canons do not cover exactly the same ground, for he says Canon XIII. requires
letters both from the Metropolitan and from the other bishops of the province, while this
canon XXII. requires only the consent of the diocesan. He concludes that Canon XIII. refers
to a diocese sede vacante, when the Metropolitan with the other bishops took care of the
widowed church, but that Canon XXII. refers to a diocese with its own bishop, whose will
is all that is needed for the performance of episcopal acts by another bishop. And this distinction
Schelestratius makes still more evident by his discussion of the matter in his scholion
on Canon XIII.</p>
<p>Compare with this canon of the Apostolic Canons number XXXV. also number XIV.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars II., Causa
IX., Quæst. II., can. vij., but in a form differing far from the Greek original, as the Roman

<head>Canon XXIII.</head>
<p>It shall not be lawful for a bishop, even at the close of life, to appoint another as successor
to himself; and if any such thing should be done, the appointment shall be void. But the
ecclesiastical law must be observed, that a bishop must not be appointed otherwise than by
a synod and with the judgment of the bishops, who have the authority to promote the man
who is worthy, after the falling asleep of him who has ceased from his labours.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIII.</p>
<p>A dying bishop shall not appoint another bishop. But when he is dead a worthy successor
shall be provided by a synod of those who have this power.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more important than the provision of this canon. It is evidently in-
tended to prevent nepotism in every form, and to leave the appointment to the vacant see
absolutely to the free choice of the Metropolitan and his synod. The history of the Church,
and its present practice, is a curious commentary upon the ancient legislation, and the appointment
of coadjutor bishops cum jure successionis, so common in later days, seems to
be a somewhat ingenious way of escaping the force of the canon. Van Espen, however, reminds
his readers of the most interesting case of St. Augustine of Hippo (which he himself
narrates in his Epistle CCXIII.) of how he was chosen by his predecessor as bishop of Hippo,
both he and the then bishop being ignorant of the fact that it was prohibited by the canons.
And how when in his old age the people wished him to have one chosen bishop to help him
till his death and to succeed him afterwards, he declined saying: “What was worthy of blame
in my own case, shall not be a blot likewise upon my son.” He did not hesitate to say who
he thought most worthy to succeed him, but he added, “he shall be a presbyter, as he is, and
when God so wills he shall be a bishop.” Van Espen adds; “All this should be read carefully
that thence may be learned how St. Augustine set an example to bishops and pastors of
taking all the pains possible that after their deaths true pastors, and not thieves and wolves,
should enter into their flocks, who in a short time would destroy all they had accomplished
by so much labour in so long a time.” (Cf. Eusebius. H. E., Lib. VI., cap. xj. and cap. xxxij.)</p>

<p>It is right that what belongs to the Church be preserved with all care to the Church, with
a good conscience and faith in God, the inspector and judge of all. And these things ought
to be administered under the judgment and authority of the bishop, who is entrusted with
the whole people and with the souls of the congregation. But it should be manifest what is
church property, with the knowledge of the presbyters and deacons about him; so that these
may know assuredly what things belong to the Church, and that nothing be concealed from
them, in order that, when the bishop may happen to depart this life, the property belonging
to the Church being well known, may not be embezzled nor lost, and in order that the private
property of the bishop may not be disturbed on a pretence that it is part of the ecclesiastical
goods. For it is just and well-pleasing to God and man that the private property of the
bishop be bequeathed to whomsoever he will, but that for the Church be kept whatever belongs
to the Church; so that neither the Church may suffer loss, nor the bishop be injured
under pretext of the Church’s interest, nor those who belong to him fall into lawsuits, and
himself, after his death, be brought under reproach.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>

<p>This canon shews the early discipline according to which the presbyters and deacons
of the episcopal city, who were said to be “about him” or to pertain to his chair, represented
the senate of the church, who together with the bishop administered the church affairs, and,
when the see was vacant, had the charge of it. All this Martin of Braga sets forth more clearly
in his version, and I have treated of the matter at large in my work on Ecclesiastical Law,

that they may in no way lack, according to the divine Apostle, who says, “Having food and
raiment, let us therewith be content.” And if he shall not be content with these, but shall
apply the funds to his own private uses, and not manage the revenues of the Church, or the
rent of the farms, with the consent of the presbyters and deacons, but shall give the authority
to his own domestics and kinsmen, or brothers, or sons, so that the accounts of the Church
are secretly injured, he himself shall submit to an investigation by the synod of the province.
But if, on the other hand, the bishop or his presbyters shall be defamed as appropriating to
themselves what belongs to the Church, (whether from lands or any other ecclesiastical resources),

this holy Synod. Theodore, Nicetas, Macedonius, Anatolius, Tarcodimantus, Æthereus,
Narcissus, Eustachius, Hesychius, Mauricius, Paulus, and the rest, thirty bishops agreed and

<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>The Laodicea at which the Synod met is Laodicea in Phrygia Pacatiana, also called
Laodicea ad Lycum, and to be carefully distinguished from the Laodicea in Syria. This much
is certain, but as to the exact date of the Synod there is much discussion. Peter de Marca
fixed it at the year 365, but Pagi in his Critica on Baronius’s Annals172 seems to have overthrown
the arguments upon which de Marca rested, and agrees with Gothofred in placing
it circa 363. At first sight it would seem that the Seventh Canon gave a clue which would
settle the date, inasmuch as the Photinians are mentioned, and Bishop Photinus began to
be prominent in the middle of the fourth century and was anathematized by the Eusebians
in a synod at Antioch in 344, and by the orthodox at Milan in 345; and finally, after several
other condemnations, he died in banishment in 366. But it is not quite certain whether the
word “Photinians” is not an interpolation. Something with regard to the date may perhaps
be drawn from the word Πακατιανῆς as descriptive of Phrygia, for it is probable that this
division was not yet made at the time of the Sardican Council in 343. Hefele concludes that
“Under such circumstances, it is best, with Remi Ceillier, Tillemont, and others, to place
the meeting of the synod of Laodicea generally somewhere between the years 343 and 381,
i.e., between the Sardican and the Second Ecumenical Council—and to give up the attempt
to discover a more exact date.”173</p>
<p>But since the traditional position of the canons of this Council is after those of Antioch
and immediately before those of First Constantinople, I have followed this order. Such is
their position in “very many old collections of the Councils which have had their origin
since the sixth or even in the fifth century,” says Hefele. It is true that Matthew Blastares
places these canons after those of Sardica, but the Quinisext Synod in its Second Canon and
Pope Leo IV., according to the Corpus Juris Canonici,174 give them the position which they
hold in this volume.</p>

<p>Many synods imposed a penance upon digamists, although the Church never condemned
second marriages.</p>
<p>On this whole subject of second marriages see notes on Canon VIII. of Nice, on Canons
III. and VII. of Neocæsarea, and on Canon XIX. of Ancyra. In treating of this canon Hefele
does little but follow Van Espen, who accepts Bishop Beveridge’s conclusions in opposition
to Justellus and refers to him, as follows, “See this observation of Justellus’ refuted more at
length by William Beveridge in his notes on this canon,” and Bp. Beveridge adopted and
defended the exposition of the Greek commentators, viz.: there is some fault and some
punishment, they are to be held back from communion for “a short space,” but after that,
it is according to the law of the Church that they should be admitted to communion. The
phrase “not having previously made a secret marriage” means that there must not have been
intercourse with the woman before the second marriage was “lawfully” contracted, for if so
the punishment would have been for fornication, and neither light nor for “a short space.”
The person referred to in the canon is a real digamist and not a bigamist, this is proved by
the word “lawfully” which could not be used of the second marriage of a man who already
had a living wife.</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>They who have sinned in divers particulars, if they have persevered in the prayer of

<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Van Espen and others were of opinion that this canon treated only of those who had
themselves been guilty of various criminal acts, and it has been asked whether any one guilty
not only of one gross sin, but of several of various kinds, might also be again received into
communion. It seems to me, however, that this canon with the words, “those who have
sinned in divers particulars,” simply means that “sinners of various kinds shall be treated
exactly in proportion to the extent of their fall.” That the question is not necessarily of different
sins committed by the same person appears from the words, “in proportion to the
nature of their offence,” as the singular, not the plural, is here used.</p>
<p>But Van Espen, with Aubespine, is clearly right in not referring the words, “if they persevere
in confession and repentance,” to sacramental confession, to which the expression
“persevere” would not be well suited. Here is evidently meant the oft-repeated contrite
confession before God and the congregation in prayer of sins committed, which preceded
sacramental confession and absolution.</p>

<p>Novatians and Photinians, and Quartodecimans, unless they anathemathize their own
and other heresies, are not to be received. When they have been anointed, after their abjuration,
let them communicate.</p>
<p>I have allowed the word “Photinians” to stand in the text although whether it is not an
interpolation is by no means certain. They certainly were heretical on the doctrine of the
Holy Trinity, and therefore differed from the other dissidents mentioned in the canon, all
of whom were orthodox on this matter. It is also worthy of note that the word is not found
in Ferrandus’s Condensation (Breviatio Canonum, n. 177) nor in Isidore’s version. Moreover
there is a Latin codex in Lucca, and also one in Paris (as is noted by Mansi, v. 585; ij. 591)
in which it is lacking. It was rejected by Baronius, Binius, and Remi Ceillier.</p>
<p>The word “Catechumens” is wanting in many Greek mss. but found in Balsamon,
moreover, Dionysius and Isidore had it in their texts.</p>
<p>This canon possesses a great interest and value to the student from a different point of
view. Its provisions, both doctrinal and disciplinary, are in contrariety with the provisions
of the council held at Carthage in the time of St. Cyprian, and yet both these canons, contradictory
as they are, are accepted by the Council in Trullo and are given such ecumenical
authority as canons on discipline ever can possess, by the Seventh Ecumenical. This is not
the only matter in which the various conciliar actions adopted and ratified do not agree
inter se, and from this consideration it would seem evident that it was not intended that to
each particular of each canon of each local synod adopted, the express sanction of the Universal
Church was given, but that they were received in block as legislation well calculated
for the good of the Church. And that this must have been the understanding at the time is
evinced by the fact that while the Trullan canons condemned a number of Western customs
and usages, as I shall have occasion to point out in its proper place, no objection was made

<head>Canon VIII.</head>
<p>Persons converted from the heresy of those who are called Phrygians, even should they

chiefest, are with all care to be both instructed and baptized by the bishops and presbyters

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</p>
<p>When Phrygians return they are to be baptized anew, even if among them they were
reckoned clergymen.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>This synod here declares the baptism of the Montanists invalid, while in the preceding
canon it recognised as valid the baptism of the Novatians and Quartodecimans. From this,
it would appear that the Montanists were suspected of heresy with regard to the doctrine
of the Trinity. Some other authorities of the ancient Church, however, judged differently,
and for a long time it was a question in the Church whether to consider the baptism of the
Montanists valid or not. Dionysius the Great of Alexandria was in favour of its validity:
but this Synod and the Second General Council rejected it as invalid, not to mention the
Synod of Iconium (235), which declared all heretical baptism invalid. This uncertainty of
the ancient Church is accounted for thus: (a) On one side the Montanists, and especially
Tertullian, asserted that they held the same faith and sacraments, especially the same baptism
(eadem lavacri sacramenta) as the Catholics. St. Epiphanius concurred in this, and testified
that the Montanists taught the same regarding the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as
did the Catholic Church. (b) Other Fathers, however, thought less favourably of them, and
for this reason, that the Montanists often expressed themselves so ambiguously, that they
might, nay, must be said completely to identify the Holy Ghost with Montanus. Thus Tertullian
in quoting expressions of Montanus, actually says: “the Paraclete speaks”; and
therefore Firmilian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil the Great, and other Fathers, did in fact, reproach
the Montanists with this identification, and consequently held their baptism to be invalid.
(c) Basil the Great goes to the greatest length in this direction in maintaining that the
Montanists had baptized in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of Montanus and Priscilla.
But it is very probable, as Tillemont conjectured, that Basil only founded these strange
stories of their manner of baptizing upon his assumption that they identified Montanus
with the Holy Ghost; and, as Baronius maintains, it is equally “probable that the Montanists
did not alter the form of baptism. But, even admitting all this, their ambiguous expressions

<pb n="272"/>
concerning Montanus and the Holy Ghost would alone have rendered it advisable to declare
their baptism invalid.” (d) Besides this, a considerable number of Montanists, namely, the
school of Æschines, fell into Sabellianism, and thus their baptism was decidedly invalid.
(Vide Article in Wetzer and Welte Kirchenlexicon s.v. Montanus; by myself [i.e. Hefele]).</p>
<p>In conclusion, it must be observed that Balsamon and Zonaras rightly understood the
words in our text, “even though they be called the very chiefest,” “though they be held in
the highest esteem,” to refer to the most distinguished clergy and teachers of the Montanists.</p>

<p>The members of the Church are not allowed to meet in the cemeteries, nor attend the

have sinned they shall be received.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</p>
<p>Whoso prayeth in the cemeteries and martyries of heretics is to be excommunicated.
Zonaras.</p>
<p>By the word “service” (θεραπείας) in this canon is to be understood the healing of
sickness. The canon wishes that the faithful should under no pretence betake themselves
to the prayers of heretical pseudo-martyrs nor pay them honour in the hope of obtaining
the healing of sickness or the cure of their various temptations. And if any do so, they are
to be cut off, that is for a time forbidden communion (and this refers to the faithful who are
only laymen), but when they have done penance and made confession of their fault, the
canon orders that they are to be received back again.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>As canon vi. forbids heretics to enter the house of God, so this canon forbids the faithful
to go to the cemeteries of heretics, which are called by them “Martyries.”…For in the days
of the persecution, certain of the heretics, calling themselves Christians, suffered even to
death, and hence those who shared their opinions called them “martyrs.”
Van Espen.</p>
<p>As Catholics had their martyrs, so too had the heretics, and especially the Montanists
or Phrygians, who greatly boasted of them. Apollinaris writes of these as may be seen in
Eusebius (H. E., Lib. v., cap. xvj.)</p>
<p>The places or cemeteries in which rested the bodies of those they boasted of as martyrs,
they styled “Martyries” (martyria) as similar places among Catholics were wont to be called
by the same name, from the bones of the martyrs that rested there.</p>
<p>From the Greek text, as also from Isidore’s version it is clear that this canon refers to
all the faithful generally, and that “the members of the Church” (Lat. Ecclesiastici, the word
Dionysius uses) must be taken in this wide signification.</p>

xiv.), suppose this restriction only to apply to the children of the clergy, but Van Espen has
shewn that the rule is of general application. He adds, however, the following:</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Since by the custom of the Greeks, ecclesiastics are allowed to have wives, there is no
doubt that the marriage of their children with heretics would be indecent in a very special
degree, although there are many things which go to shew that marriage with heretics was
universally deemed a thing to be avoided by Catholics, and was rightly forbidden.</p>

<head>Canon XI.</head>
<p>Presbytides, as they are called, or female presidents, are not to be appointed in the
Church.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</p>
<p>Widows called presidents shall not be appointed in churches.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>In old days certain venerable women (πρεσβύτιδες) sat in Catholic churches, and took
care that the other women kept good and modest order. But from their habit of using improperly
that which was proper, either through their arrogancy or through their base selfseeking,
scandal arose. Therefore the Fathers prohibited the existence in the Church
thereafter of any more such women as are called presbytides or presidents. And that no
one may object that in the monasteries of women one woman must preside over the rest, it
should be remembered that the renunciation which they make of themselves to God and
the tonsure brings it to pass that they are thought of as one body though many; and all things
which are theirs, relate only to the salvation of the soul. But for woman to teach in a Catholic
Church, where a multitude of men is gathered together, and women of different opinions,
is, in the highest degree, indecorous and pernicious.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>It is doubtful what was here intended, and this canon has received very different interpretations.
In the first place, what is the meaning of the words πρεσβύτιδες and
προκαθήμεναι (“presbytides” and female presidents)? I think the first light is thrown on
the subject by Epiphanius, who in his treatise against the Collyridians (Hær., lxxix. 4) says
that “women had never been allowed to offer sacrifice, as the Collyridians presumed to do,
but were only allowed to minister. Therefore there were only deaconesses in the Church,
and even if the oldest among them were called ‘presbytides,’ this term must be clearly distinguished
from presbyteresses. The latter would mean priestesses (ἱερίσσας), but ‘presbytides’
only designated their age, as seniors.” According to this, the canon appears to treat
of the superior deaconesses who were the overseers (προκαθήμεναι) of the other deaconesses;
and the further words of the text may then probably mean that in future no more such superior
deaconesses or eldresses were to be appointed, probably because they had often outstepped
their authority.</p>

<pb n="276"/>
<p>Neander, Fuchs, and others, however, think it more probable that the terms in question
are in this canon to be taken as simply meaning deaconesses, for even in the church they
had been wont to preside over the female portion of the congregation (whence their name
of “presidents”); and, according to St. Paul’s rule, only widows over sixty years of age were
to be chosen for this office (hence called “presbytides”). We may add, that this direction of
the apostle was not very strictly adhered to subsequently, but still it was repeatedly enjoined
that only elder persons should be chosen as deaconesses. Thus, for instance, the Council
of Chalcedon, in its fifteenth canon, required that deaconesses should be at least forty years
of age, while the Emperor Theodosius even prescribed the age of sixty.</p>
<p>Supposing now that this canon simply treats of deaconesses, a fresh doubt arises as to
how the last words—“they are not to be appointed in the Church” are to be understood.
For it may mean that “from henceforth no more deaconesses shall be appointed;” or, that
“in future they shall no more be solemnly ordained in the church.” The first interpretation
would, however, contradict the fact that the Greek Church had deaconesses long after the
Synod of Laodicea. For instance, in 692 the Synod in Trullo (Can. xiv.) ordered that “no
one under forty years of age should be ordained deaconess.” Consequently the second interpretation,
“they shall not be solemnly ordained in the church,” seems a better one, and
Neander decidedly prefers it. It is certainly true that several later synods distinctly forbade
the old practice of conferring a sort of ordination upon deaconesses, as, for instance, the
first Synod of Orange (Arausicanum I. of 441, Can. xxvj.) in the words—diaconæ omnimodis
non ordinandæ; also the Synod at Epaon in 517 (Can. xxj.), and the second Synod at Orleans
in 533 (Can. xviij.); but in the Greek Church at least, an ordination, a χειροτονεῖσθαι , took
place as late as the Council in Trullo (Can. xiv.). But this Canon of Laodicea does not speak
of solemn dedication, and certainly not of ordination, but only of καθίστασθαι. These
reasons induce us to return to the first interpretation of this canon, and to understand it as
forbidding from that time forward the appointment of any more chief deaconesses or
“presbytides.”</p>
<p>Zonaras and Balsamon give yet another explanation. In their opinion, these “presbytides”
were not chief deaconesses, but aged women in general (ex populo), to whom was given the
supervision of the females, in church. The Synod of Laodicea, however, did away with this
arrangement, probably because they had misused their office for purposes of pride, or
money-making, bribery, etc.</p>
<p>Compare with the foregoing the Excursus on Deaconesses, appended to Canon XIX. of
Nice.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I., Dist.
XXXII., c. xix., in Isidore’s version; but Van Espen remarks that the Roman Correctors have
pointed out that it departs widely from the Greek original. The Roman Correctors further

<pb n="277"/>
say “The note of Balsamon on this point should be seen;” and with this interpretation
Morinus also agrees in his work on Holy Orders (De Ordinationibus, Pars III., Exercit. x.,

<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The word in the Greek to which “multitude” corresponds (ὄχλος) properly signifies a
tumult.176</p>
<p>What the fathers intend to forbid are tumultuous elections, that is, that no attention is
to be paid to riotous demonstrations on the part of the people, when with acclamations they
are demanding the ordination of anyone, with an appearance of sedition. Such a state of
affairs St. Augustine admirably describes in his Epistola ad Albinam (Epist. cxxvi., Tom. II,
col. 548, Ed. Gaume).</p>
<p>And it is manifest that by this canon the people were not excluded from all share in the
election of bishops and priests from what St. Gregory Nazianzen says, in Epistola ad
Cæsarienses, with regard to the election of St. Basil. From this what could be more evident
than that after this canon was put out the people in the East still had their part in the election
of a bishop? This also is clear from Justinian’s “Novels” (Novellæ, cxxiij., c.j., and cxxxvij.,

<p>The holy things are not to be sent into other dioceses at the feast of Easter by way of
eulogiæ.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</p>
<p>It is not right to send the holy gifts to another parish.
Hefele.</p>
<p>It was a custom in the ancient Church, not indeed to consecrate, but to bless such of
the several breads of the same form laid on the altar as were not needed for the communion,
and to employ them, partly for the maintenance of the clergy, and partly for distributing to
those of the faithful who did not communicate at the Mass. The breads thus blessed were
called eulogiæ. Another very ancient custom was, that bishops as a sign of Church fellowship,
should send the consecrated bread to one another. That the Roman Popes of the first and
second centuries did so, Irenæus testifies in his letter to Pope Victor in Eusebius. In course
of time, however, instead of the consecrated bread, only bread which had been blessed, or
eulogiæ, were sent abroad. For instance, Paulinus and Augustine sent one another these
eulogiæ. But at Easter the older custom still prevailed; and to invest the matter with more
solemnity, instead of the eulogiæ, the consecrated bread, i.e., the Eucharist, was sent out.
The Synod of Laodicea forbids this, probably out of reverence to the holy Sacrament.</p>
<p>Binterim (Denkwürdegkeiten, vol. IV., P. iij., p. 535.) gives another explanation. He
starts from the fact that, with the Greeks as well as the Latins, the wafer intended for communion
is generally called sancta or ἅγια even before the consecration. This is not only
perfectly true, but a well-known fact; only it must not be forgotten that these wafers or oblations
were only called sancta by anticipation, and because of the sanctificatio to which
they were destined. Binterim then states that by ἅγιαin the canon is to be understood not
the breads already consecrated, but those still unconsecrated. He further conjectures that
these unconsecrated breads were often sent about instead of the eulogiæ, and that the Synod
of Laodicea had forbidden this, not during the whole year, but only at Easter. He cannot,
however, give any reason, and his statement is the more doubtful, as he cannot prove that
these unconsecrated communion breads really used before to be sent about as eulogiæ.</p>
<p>In connection with this, however, he adds another hypothesis. It is known that the
Greeks only consecrate a square piece of the little loaf intended for communion, which is
first cut out with the so-called holy spear. The remainder of the small loaf is divided into
little pieces, which remain on or near the altar during Mass, after which they are distributed

<pb n="282"/>
to the non-communicants. These remains of the small loaf intended for consecration are
called ἀντίδωρα and Binterim’s second conjecture is, that these ἀντίδωρα might perhaps
have been sent as eulogiæ and may be the ἅγια of this canon. But he is unable to prove that
these ἀντίδωρα were sent about, and is, moreover, obliged to confess that they are nowhere
called eulogiæ, while this canon certainly speaks of eulogiæ. To this must be added that, as
with regard to the unconsecrated wafer, so we see no sufficient cause why the Synod should
have forbidden these ἀντίδωρα being sent.</p>

text, or whether it only intended to forbid those who were not cantors taking the lead. Van
Espen and Neander in particular were in favour of the latter meaning, pointing to the fact
that certainly in the Greek Church after the Synod of Laodicea the people were accustomed
to join in the singing, as Chrysostom and Basil the Great sufficiently testify. Bingham pro-
pounded a peculiar opinion, namely, that this Synod did indeed forbid the laity to sing in
the church, or even to join in the singing, but this only temporarily, for certain reasons. I
have no doubt, however, that Van Espen and Neander take the truer view.</p>

<p>The Gospels are to be read on the Sabbath [i.e. Saturday], with the other Scriptures.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.</p>
<p>The Gospel, the Epistle [ἀπόστολος ] and the other Scriptures are to be read on the Sabbath.
Balsamon.</p>
<p>Before the arrangement of the Ecclesiastical Psalmody was settled, neither the Gospel
nor the other Scriptures were accustomed to be read on the Sabbath. But out of regard to
the canons which forbade fasting or kneeling on the Sabbath, there were no services, so that
there might be as much feasting as possible. This the fathers prohibit, and decree that on
the Sabbath the whole ecclesiastical office shall be said.</p>
<p>Neander (Kirchengesch., 2d ed., vol. iij., p. 565 et seq.) suggests in addition to the interpretation
just given another, viz.: that it was the custom in many parts of the ancient Church
to keep every Saturday as a feast in commemoration of the Creation. Neander also suggests
that possibly some Judaizers read on the Sabbath only the Old Testament; he, however,
himself remarks that in this case εὐαγγέλια and ἑτέρων γραφῶν would require the article.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Among the Greeks the Sabbath was kept exactly as the Lord’s day except so far as the
cessation of work was concerned, wherefore the Council wishes that, as on Sundays, after
the other lessons there should follow the Gospel.</p>
<p>For it is evident that by the intention of the Church the whole Divine Office was designed
for the edification and instruction of the people, and especially was this the case on feast
days, when the people were apt to be present in large numbers.</p>
<p>Here we may note the origin of our present [Western] discipline, by which on Sundays
and feast days the Gospel is wont to be read with the other Scriptures in the canonical hours,
while such is not the case on ferial days, or in the order for ferias and “simples.”177</p>

<p>Some feasts ended at the ninth hour, others only in the evening, and both alike with
prayer. The Synod here wills that in both cases the same prayers should be used. Thus does
Van Espen explain the words of the text, and I think rightly. But the Greek commentator
understands the Synod to order that the same prayers should be used in all places, thus excluding
all individual caprice. According to this, the rule of conformity would refer to
places; while, according to Van Espen, the nones and vespers were to be the same. If, however,
this interpretation were correct, the Synod would not have only spoken of the prayers
at nones and vespers, but would have said in general, “all dioceses shall use the same form
of prayer.”</p>

<head>Excursus on the Choir Offices of the Early Church.</head>
<p>Nothing is more marked in the lives of the early followers of Christ than the abiding
sense which they had of the Divine Presence. Prayer was not to them an occasional exercise
but an unceasing practice. If then the Psalmist sang in the old dispensation “Seven times a
day do I praise thee” (Ps. cxix. 164), we may be quite certain that the Christians would
never fall behind the Jewish example. We know that among the Jews there were the “Hours
of Prayer,” and nothing would be, à priori, more likely than that with new and deeper significance
these should pass over into the Christian Church. I need not pause here to remind
the reader of the observance of “the hour of prayer” which is mentioned in the New Testament,
and shall pass on to my more immediate subject.</p>
<p>Most liturgiologists have been agreed that the “Choir Offices” of the Christian Church,
that is to say the recitation of the Psalms of David, with lessons from other parts of Holy
Scripture and collects,179 was an actual continuation of the Jewish worship, the melodies
even of the Psalms being carried over and modified through the ages into the plain song of
today. For this view of the Jewish origin of the Canonical Hours there is so much to be said
that one hesitates to accept a rival theory, recently set forth with much skill and learning,
by a French priest, who had the inestimable happiness of sitting at the feet of De Rossi. M.
Pierre Battifol180 is of opinion that the Canonical Hours in no way come from the Jewish
Hours of Prayer but are the outgrowth of the Saturday Vigil service, which was wholly of
Christian origin, and which he tells us was divided into three parts, j., the evening service,
or lucernarium, which was the service of Vespers; ij., the midnight service, the origin of the
Nocturns or Mattins; iij., the service at daybreak, the origin of Lauds. Soon vigils were kept
for all the martyr commemorations; and by the time of Tertullian, if not before, Wednesdays
and Fridays had their vigils. With the growth of monasticism they became daily. This Mr.
Battifol thinks was introduced into Antioch about a.d. 350, and soon spread all over the
East. The “little hours,” that is Terce, Sext, and None, he thinks were monastic in origin
and that Prime and Compline were transferred from the dormitory to the church, just as
the martyrology was transferred from the refectory.</p>
<p>Such is the new theory, which, even if rejected, at least is valuable in drawing attention
to the great importance of the vigil-service in the Early Church, an importance still attaching
to it in Russia on the night of Easter Even.</p>
<p>Of the twilight service we have a most exquisite remains in the hymn to be sung at the
lighting of the lamps. This is one of the few Psalmi idiotici which has survived the condem-

nation of such compositions by the early councils, in fact the only two others are the Gloria
in Excelsis and the Te Deum. The hymn at the lighting of the lamps is as follows:

<l>Of the Father Immortal,</l>
<l>And of the celestial</l>
<l>Sacred and blessed</l>
<l>Jesus, our Saviour!”</l>

<l>Worthy at all times</l>
<l>Of worship and wonder!181”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Dr. Battifol’s new theory was promptly attacked by P. Suibbert Bäumer, a learned German
Benedictine who had already written several magazine articles on the subject before Battifol’s
book had appeared.</p>
<p>The title of Bäumer’s book is Geschichte des Breviers, Versuch einer quellenmässigen
Darstellung der Entwicklung des altkirchen und des römeschen Officiums bis auf unsere Tage.
(Freiburg in Briesgau, 1895.) The following182 may be taken as a fair resumé of the position
taken in this work and most ably defended, a position which (if I may be allowed to express
an opinion) is more likely to prevail as being most in accordance with the previous researches
of the learned.</p>
<p>“The early Christians separated from the Synagogues about a.d. 65; that is, about the
same time as the first Epistle to Timothy was written, and at this moment of separation from
the Synagogue the Apostles had already established, besides the liturgy, at least one, probably
two, canonical hours of prayer, Mattins and Evensong. Besides what we should call sermons,
the service of these hours was made up of psalms, readings from Holy Scripture, and extempore
prayers. A few pages on (p. 42) Bäumer allows that even if this service had been daily
in Jerusalem the Apostles’ times, yet it had become limited to Sundays in the sub-Apostolic

times, when persecution would not allow the Apostolic custom of daily morning and evening
public prayer. Yet the practice of private prayer at the third, sixth, and ninth hours continued,
based upon an Apostolic tradition; and thus, when the tyranny of persecution was overpast,
the idea of public prayer at these hours was saved and the practice carried on.”</p>
<p>The student should by no means omit to read Dom Prosper Guéranger’s Institutions
Liturgiques, which while written in a bitter and most partisan spirit, is yet a work of the most
profound learning. Above all anyone professing any familiarity with the literature on the
subject must have mastered Cardinal Bona’s invaluable De Divina Psalmodia, a mine of

<head>Canon XIX.</head>
<p>After the sermons of the Bishops, the prayer for the catechumens is to be made first by
itself; and after the catechumens have gone out, the prayer for those who are under penance;
and, after these have passed under the hand [of the Bishop] and departed, there should then
be offered the three prayers of the faithful, the first to be said entirely in silence, the second
and third aloud, and then the [kiss of] peace is to be given. And, after the presbyters have
given the [kiss of] peace to the Bishop, then the laity are to give it [to one another], and so
the Holy Oblation is to be completed. And it is lawful to the priesthood alone to go to the
Altar and [there] communicate.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</p>
<p>After the prayers of the catechumens shall be said those of the Penitents, and afterwards
those of the faithful. And after the peace, or embrace, has been given, the offering shall be
made. Only priests shall enter the sanctuary and make there their communion.</p>
<p>The Greek commentators throw but little if any light upon this canon. A question has
been raised as to who said the prayers mentioned. Van Espen, following Isidore’s translation
“they also pray who are doing penance,” thinks the prayer of the penitents, said by themselves,
is intended, and not the prayer said by the Bishop. But Hefele, following Dionysius’s version—“
the prayers over the catechumens,” “over those who are doing penance”—thinks
that the liturgical prayers are intended, which after the sermon were wont to be said “over”
the different classes. Dionysius does not say “over” the faithful, but describes them as “the
prayers of the faithful,” which Hefele thinks means that the faithful joined in reciting them.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Worship of the Early Church.</head>
<p>(Percival, H. R.: Johnson’s Universal Cyclopædia, Vol. V., s.v. Liturgics.)</p>
<p>St. Paul is by some learned writers supposed to have quoted in several places the already
existing liturgy, especially in I. Cor. ij. 9.,183 and there can be no doubt that the Lord’s
prayer was used and certain other formulas which are referred to by St. Luke in the Acts of
the Apostles184 as “the Apostles’ prayers.” How early these forms were committed to writing
has been much disputed among the learned, and it would be rash to attempt to rule this
question. Pierre Le Brun185 presents most strongly the denial of their having been written
during the first three centuries, and Probst186 argues against this opinion. While it does
not seem possible to prove that before the fourth century the liturgical books were written
out in full, owing no doubt to the influence of the disciplina arcani, it seems to be true that
much earlier than this there was a definite and fixed order in the celebration of divine worship
and in the administration of the sacraments. The famous passage in St. Justin Martyr187
seems to point to the existence of such a form in his day, shewing how even then the service
for the Holy Eucharist began with the Epistle and Gospel. St. Augustine and St. Chrysostom
bear witness to the same thing.188</p>
<p>Within, comparatively speaking, a few years, a good deal of information with regard to
the worship of the early Church has been given us by the discovery of the Διδαχή, and of
the fragments the Germans describe as the K. O., and by the publication of M. Gamurrini’s
transcript of the Peregrinatio Silviæ.189</p>
<p>From all these it is thought that liturgical information of the greatest value can be obtained.
Moreover the first two are thought to throw much light upon the age and construction
of the Apostolical Constitutions. Without in any way committing myself to the views

<pb n="292"/>
I now proceed to quote, I lay them before the reader as the results of the most advanced
criticism in the matter.</p>
<p>(Duchesne. Origines du Culte Chrétien, p. 54 et seq.)</p>
<p>All known liturgies may be reduced to four principal types—the Syrian, the Alexandrian,
the Roman, and the Gallican. In the fourth century there certainly existed these four types
at the least, for the Syrian had already given rise to several sub-types which were clearly
marked.</p>
<p>The most ancient documents of the Syrian Liturgy are:</p>
<p>1. The Catechetical Lectures of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, delivered about the year 347.</p>
<p>2. The Apostolic Constitutions (Bk. II., 57, and Bk. VIII., 5–15).</p>
<p>3. The homilies of St. John Chrysostom.</p>
<p>St. John Chrysostom often quotes lines of thought and even prayers taken from the
liturgy. Bingham190 was the first to have the idea of gathering together and putting in order
these scattered references. This work has been recently taken in hand afresh by Mr. Hammond.
191 From this one can find much interesting corroborative evidence, but the orator
does not give anywhere a systematic description of the liturgy, in the order of its rites and
prayers.</p>
<p>The Catechetical Lectures of St. Cyril are really a commentary upon the ceremonies of
the mass, made to the neophytes after their initiation. The preacher does not treat of the
missa catechumenorum because his hearers had so long been familiar with it; he presupposes
the bread and wine to have been brought to and placed upon the altar, and begins at the
moment when the bishop prepares himself to celebrate the Holy Mysteries by washing his
hands.</p>
<p>In the Apostolic Constitutions a distinction must be drawn between Book II. and Book
VIII. The first is very sketchy; it only contains a description of the rites without the words
used, the other gives at length all the formulas of the prayers, but only from the end of the
Gospel.</p>
<p>We know now that the Apostolical Constitutions in the present state of the Greek text
represent a melting down and fusing together of two analogous books—the Didaskale of
the Apostles, of which only a Syriac version is extant; and the Didake of the Apostles, recently
discovered by the metropolitan, Philotheus Bryennius. The first of these two books has
served as a basis for the first six books of the Apostolical Constitutions. The second, much
spread out, has become the seventh book of the same collection. The eighth book is more
homogeneous. It must have been added to the seven others by the author of the recension
<note type="footnote">190 Bingham, Antiquities, XIII. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">191 Hammond. The Ancient Liturgy of Antioch (Oxford, 1879).</note>

<pb n="293"/>
of the Didaskale and of the Didake. This author is the same as he who made the interpolations
in the seven authentic letters of St. Ignatius, and added to them six others of his own manufacture.
He lived at Antioch in Syria, or else in the ecclesiastical region of which that city
was the centre. He wrote about the middle of the fourth century, at the very high tide of
the Subordination theology, which finds expression more than once in his different compositions.
He is the author of the description of the liturgy, which is found in Book II.; in fact,
that whole passage is lacking in the Syriac Didaskale. Was it also he who composed the
liturgy of the VIIIth book? This is open to doubt, for there are certain differences between
this liturgy and that of the IId book.192</p>
<p>I shall now describe the religious service such as these documents suppose, noting,
where necessary, their divergences.</p>
<p>The congregation is gathered together, the men on one side the women on the other,
the clergy in the apsidal chancel. The readings immediately begin; they are interrupted by
chants. A reader ascends the ambo, which stood in the middle of the church, between the
clergy and the people, and read two lessons; then another goes up in his place to sing a
psalm. This he executes as a solo, but the congregation join in the last modulations of the
chant and continue them. This is what is called the “Response” (psalmus responsorius),
which must be distinguished carefully from the “Antiphon,” which was a psalm executed
alternately by two choirs. At this early date the antiphon did not exist, only the response
was known. There must have been a considerable number of readings, but we are not told
how many. The series ended with a lection from the Gospel, which is made not by a reader
but by a priest or deacon. The congregation stands during this lesson.</p>
<p>When the lessons and psalmodies are done, the priests take the word, each in his turn,
and after them the bishop. The homily is always preceded by a salutation to the people, to
which they answer, “And with thy spirit.”</p>
<p>After the sermon the sending out of the different categories of persons who should not
assist at the holy Mysteries takes place. First of all the catechumens. Upon the invitation
of the deacon they make a prayer in silence while the congregation prays for them. The
deacon gives the outline of this prayer by detailing the intentions and the things to be prayed
for. The faithful answer, and especially the children, by the supplication Kyrie eleison. Then
the catechumens rise up, and the deacon asks them to join with him in the prayer which he
pronounces; next he makes them bow before the bishop to receive his benediction, after
which he sends them home.</p>
<p>The same form is used for the energumens, for the competentes, i.e., for the catechumens
who are preparing to receive baptism, and last of all for the penitents.</p>
<note type="footnote">192 The reader will, of course, recognize the foregoing as a piece of “Higher Criticism,” and need not be told
that it rests upon no foundation more secure than probable guess-work.</note>

<pb n="294"/>
<p>When there remain in the church only the faithful communicants, these fall to prayer;
and prostrate toward the East they listen while the deacon says the litany—“For the peace
and good estate of the world; for the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church; for bishops,
priests; for the Church’s benefactors; for the neophytes; for the sick; for travellers; for little
children; for those who are erring,” etc. And to all these petitions is added Kyrie eleison.
The litany ends with this special form “Save us, and raise us up, O God, for thy mercy’s
sake.” Then the voice of the bishop rises in the silence—he pronounces a solemn prayer of
a grave and majestic style.</p>
<p>Here ends the first part of the liturgy; that part which the Church had taken from the
old use of the synagogues. The second part, the Christian liturgy, properly so-called, begins
by the salutation of the bishop, followed by the response of the people. Then, at a sign given
by a deacon, the clergy receive the kiss of peace from the bishop, and the faithful give it to
each other, men to men, women to women.</p>
<p>Then the deacons and the other lower ministers divide themselves between watching
and serving at the altar. The one division go through the congregation, keeping all in their
proper place, and the little children on the outskirts of the sacred enclosure, and watching
the door that no profane person may enter the church. The others bring and set upon the
altar the breads and the chalices prepared for the Sacred Banquet; two of them wave fans
backwards and forwards to protect the holy offerings from insects. The bishop washes his
hands and vests himself in festal habit; the priests range themselves around him, and all together
they approach the altar. This is a solemn moment. After private prayer the bishop
makes the sign of the cross upon his brow and begins,</p>
<p>“The grace of God Almighty, and the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the communion
of the Holy Ghost be with you always!”
<lg>
<l>“And with thy spirit.”</l>
<l>“Lift up your hearts.”</l>
<l>“We lift them up unto the Lord.”</l>
<l>“Let us give thanks unto our Lord.”</l>
<l>“It is meet and right so to do.”</l>
<l>“It is very meet,” etc.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And the eucharistic prayer goes on…concluding at last with a return to the mysterious
Sanctuary where God abides in the midst of spirits, where the Cherubims and the Seraphims
eternally make heaven ring with the trisagion.</p>
<p>Here the whole multitude of the people lift up their voices and joining their song with
that of the choir of Angels, sing, “Holy, Holy, Holy,” etc.</p>
<p>When the hymn is done and silence returns, the bishop continues the interrupted
eucharistic prayer.</p>

<pb n="295"/>
<p>“Thou truly art holy,” etc., and goes on to commemorate the work of Redemption, the
Incarnation of the Word, his mortal life, his passion; now the officiant keeps close to the
Gospel account of the last supper; the mysterious words pronounced at first by Jesus on the
night before his death are heard over the holy table. Then, taking his inspiration from the
last words, “Do this in remembrance of me,” the bishop develops the idea, recalling the
Passion of the Son of God, his death, his resurrection, his ascension, the hope of his glorious
return, and declaring that it is in order to observe this precept and make this memorial that
the congregation offers to God this eucharistic bread and wine. Finally he prays the Lord
to turn upon the Oblation a favourable regard, and to send down upon it the power of his
Holy Spirit, to make it the Body and Blood of Christ, the spiritual food of his faithful, and
the pledge of their immortality.</p>
<p>Thus ends the eucharistic prayer, properly so-called. The mystery is consummated.…The
bishop then directs the prayers…and when this long prayer is finished by a doxology, all
the congregation answer “Amen,” and thus ratify his acts of thanks and intercession.</p>
<p>After this is said “Our Father,” accompanied by a short litany.…The bishop then pronounces
his benediction on the people.</p>
<p>The deacon awakes the attention of the faithful and the bishop cries aloud, “Holy things
for holy persons.” And the people answer, “There is one only holy, one only Lord Jesus
Christ, to the glory of God the Father,” etc.</p>
<p>No doubt at this moment took place the fraction of the bread, a ceremony which the
documents of the fourth century do not mention in express terms.</p>
<p>The communion then follows. The bishop receives first, then the priests, the deacons,
the sub-deacons, the readers, the singers, the ascetics, the deaconesses, the virgins, the widows,
the little children, and last of all the people.</p>
<p>The bishop places the consecrated bread in the right hand, which is open, and supported
by the left; the deacon holds the chalice—they drink out of it directly. To each communicant
the bishop says, “The Body of Christ”; and the deacon says, “The Blood of Christ, the Cup
of life,” to which the answer is made, “Amen.”</p>
<p>During the communion the singers execute Psalm XXXIII. <del>XXXIV. Heb. numbering</del>
Benedicam Dominum, in which the words “O, taste and see how gracious the Lord is,” have
a special suitability.</p>
<p>When the communion is done, the deacon gives the sign for prayer, which the bishop
offers in the name of all; then all bow to receive his blessing. Finally the deacon dismisses
the congregation, saying, “Go in peace.”193</p>

<p>A deacon shall not sit down unless bidden.</p>
<p>This is another canon to curb the ambition of Levites who wish to take upon themselves
the honours of the priesthood also. Spiritual Cores seem to have been common in early
times among the deacons and this is but one of many canons on the subject. Compare
Canon XVIII of the Council of Nice. Van Espen points out that in the Apostolic Constitutions
(Lib. II., cap. lvij), occurs the following passage, “Let the seat for the bishop be set in
the midst, and on each side of him let the presbyters sit, and let the deacons stand, having
their loins girded.”</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Here it should be noted, by the way, that in this canon there is presented a hierarchy

<p>The subdeacons have no right to a place in the Diaconicum, nor to touch the Lord’s

Hefele.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether by diaconicum is here meant the place where the deacons stood
during service, or the diaconicum generally so called, which answers to our sacristy of the
present day. In this diaconicum the sacred vessels and vestments were kept; and as the last
part of the canon especially mentions these, I have no doubt that the diaconicum must mean
the sacristy. For the rest, this canon is only the concrete expression of the rule, that the
subdeacons shall not assume the functions of the deacons.</p>
<p>With regard to the last words of this canon, Morinus and Van Espen are of opinion that
the subdeacons were not altogether forbidden to touch the sacred vessels, for this had never
been the case, but that it was intended that at the solemn entrance to the altar, peculiar to
the Greek service, the sacred vessels which were then carried should not be borne by the
subdeacons.</p>

<head>Canon XXII.</head>
<p>The subdeacon has no right to wear an orarium <del>i.e., stole</del>, nor to leave the doors.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.</p>
<p>A subdeacon must not wear an orarium nor leave the doors.</p>
<p>The “orarium” is what we call now the stole.</p>
<p>In old times, so we are told by Zonaras and Balsamon, it was the place of the subdeacons
to stand at the church doors and to bring in and take out the catechumens and the penitents
at the proper points in the service. Zonaras remarks that no one need be surprised if this,
like many other ancient customs, has been entirely changed and abandoned.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I., Dist.
xxxii., canon xxvij., but reads hostias instead of ostia, thus making the canon forbid the
subdeacons to leave the Hosts; and to make this worse the ancient Glossator adds, “but the
subdeacon should remain and consume them with the other ministers.” The Roman Correctors
indeed note the error but have not felt themselves at liberty to correct it on account
of the authority of the gloss. Van Espen remarks “To-day if any Hosts remain which are
not to be reserved, the celebrant consumes them himself, but perchance in the time the gloss
was written, it was the custom that the subdeacons and other ministers of the altar were
accustomed to do this, but whenever the ministers present gradually fell into the habit of
not receiving the sacrament, this consumption of what remained devolved upon the celebrant.”

<note type="footnote">194 It is interesting to note that the ancient custom is in full use in the Anglican Church today, ordered expressly
by the rubrics of the Prayer Book.</note>

<head>Excursus on the Vestments of the Early Church.</head>
<p>It would be out of place to enter into any specific treatment of the different vestments
worn by the clergy in the performance of their various duties. For a full discussion of this
whole matter I must refer my readers to the great writers on liturgical and kindred matters,
especially to Cardinal Bona, De Rebus Liturgicis; Pugin, Ecclesiastical Glossary; Rock, Church
of our Fathers; Hefele, Beiträge zu Kircheschichte, Archäologie und Liturgik (essay in Die
Liturgischen Gervänder, vol. ij. p. 184 sqq.). And I would take this opportunity of warning
the student against the entirely unwarranted conclusions of Durandus’s Rationale Divinorum
Officiorum and of Marriott’s Vestiarium Christianum.</p>
<p>The manner in which the use of the stole is spoken of in this canon shews not only the
great antiquity of that vestment but of other ecclesiastical vestments as well. Before, however,
giving the details of our knowledge with regard to this particular vestment I shall need no
apology for quoting a passage, very germane to the whole subject, from the pen of that most
delightful writer Curzon, to whose care and erudition all scholars and students of manuscripts
are so deeply indebted.</p>
<p>(Robert Curzon, Armenia, p. 202.)</p>
<p>Here I will remark that the sacred vestures of the Christian Church are the same, with
very insignificant modifications, among every denomination of Christians in the world;
that they have always been the same, and never were otherwise in any country, from the
remotest times when we have any written accounts of them, or any mosaics, sculptures, or
pictures to explain their forms. They are no more a Popish invention, or have anything
more to do with the Roman Church, than any other usage which is common to all denominations
of Christians. They are and always have been, of general and universal—that is, of
Catholic—use; they have never been used for many centuries for ornament or dress by the
laity, having been considered as set apart to be used only by priests in the church during
the celebration of the worship of Almighty God.</p>
<p>Thus far the very learned Curzon. As is natural the distinctive dress of the bishops is
the first that we hear of, and that in connexion with St. John, who is said to have worn a
golden mitre or fillet.195</p>
<p>(Duchesne, Origines du Culte Chrétien, p. 376 et sqq.)</p>
<p>It was not the bishops alone who were distinguished by insignia from the other ecclesiastics.
Priests and deacons had their distinctive insignia as well. There was, however, a
difference between Rome and the rest of the world in this matter. At Rome it would seem
<note type="footnote">195 Eusebius. Hist. Eccl., v. 24.</note>

<pb n="300"/>
that but little favour was extended at first to these marks of rank; the letter of Pope Celestine
to the bishops shews this already. But what makes it evident still more clearly, is that the
orarium of the priest and of the deacon, looked upon as a visible and distinctive mark of
these orders, was unknown at Rome, at least down to the tenth century, while it had been
adopted everywhere else.</p>
<p>To be sure, the orarium is spoken of in the ordines of the ninth century; but from these
it is also evident that this vestment was worn by acolytes and subdeacons, as well as by the
superior clergy, and that its place was under the top vestment, whether dalmatic or chasuble,
and not over it. But that orarium is nothing more than the ancient sweat-cloth (sudarium),
the handkerchief, or cravat which has ended up by taking a special form and even by becoming
an accessory of a ceremonial vestment: but it is not an insignia. I know no Roman
representation of this earlier than the twelfth century. The priests and deacons who figure
in the mosaics never display this detail of costume.</p>
<p>But such is not the case elsewhere. Towards the end of the fourth century, the Council
of Laodicea in Phrygia forbade inferior classes, subdeacons, readers, etc., to usurp the orarium.
St. Isidore of Pelusium knew it as somewhat analogous to the episcopal pallium, except
that it was of linen, while the pallium was of wool. The sermon on the Prodigal Son,
sometimes attributed to St. John Chrysostom [Migne’s Ed., vol. viij., 520], uses the same
term, ὀθόνη; it adds that this piece of dress was worn over the left shoulder, and that as it
swung back and forth it called to mind the wings of the angels.</p>
<p>The deacons among the Greeks wear the stole in this fashion down to to-day, perfectly
visible, over the top of the upper vestment, and fastened upon the left shoulder. Its ancient
name (ὠράριον) still clings to it. As for the orarium of the priests it is worn, like the stole
of Latin priests, round the neck, the two ends falling in front, almost to the feet. This is
called the epitrachilion (ἐπιτραχήλιον).</p>
<p>These distinctions were also found in Spain and Gaul. The Council of Braga, in 561,
ordered that deacons should wear these oraria, not under the tunicle, which caused them
to be confounded with the subdeacon, but over it, over the shoulder. The Council of Toledo,
in 633, describes the orarium as the common mark of the three superior orders, bishops,
priests, and deacons; and specifies that the deacon should wear his over his left shoulder,
and that it should be white, without any mixture of colours or any gold embroidery. Another
Council of Braga forbade priests to say mass without having a stole around their necks and
crossed upon the breast, exactly as Latin priests wear it to-day. St. Germanus of Paris speaks
of the insignia of a bishop and of a deacon; to the first he assigns the name of pallium, and
says that it is worn around the neck, and falls down upon the breast where it ends with a
fringe. As for the insignia of a deacon he calls it a stole (stola); and says that deacons wear
it over the alb. This fashion of wearing the stole of the deacon spread during the middle
ages over nearly the whole of Italy and to the very gates of Rome. And even at Rome the

<pb n="301"/>
ancient usage seems to have been maintained with a compromise. They ended up by adopting
the stole for deacons and by placing it over the left shoulder, but they covered it up with the
dalmatic or the chasuble.</p>
<p>The priest’s stole was also accepted: and in the mosaics of Sta. Maria in Trastevere is
seen a priest ornamented with this insignia. It is worthy of notice that the four popes who
are represented in the same mosaic wear the pallium but no stole. The one seems to exclude
the other. And as a matter of fact the ordines of the ninth century in describing the costume
of the pope omit always the stole. One can readily understand that who bore one of these
insignia should not wear the other.</p>
<p>However, they ended by combining them, and at Ravenna, where they always had a
taste for decorations, bishop Ecclesius in the mosaics of San Vitale wears both the priest’s
stole and the Roman pallium. This, however, seems to be unique, and his successors have
the pallium only. The two are found together again in the Sacramentary of Autun (Vide M.
Lelisle’s reproduction in the Gazette Archéologique, 1884, pl. 20), and on the paliotto of St.
Ambrose of Milan; such seems to have been the usage of the Franks.</p>
<p>In view of these facts one is led to the conclusion that all these insignia, called pallium,
omophorion, orarium, stole, epitrachilion, have the same origin. They are the marks of
dignity, introduced into church usage during the fourth century, analogous to those which
the Theodosian code orders for certain kinds of civil functionaries. For one reason or another
the Roman Church refused to receive these marks, or rather confined itself to the
papal pallium, which then took a wholly technical signification. But everywhere else, this
mark of the then superior orders of the hierarchy was adopted, only varying slightly to mark
the degree, the deacon wearing it over the left shoulder, the bishop and priest around the
neck, the deacon over the tunicle which is his uppermost vestment, the priest under the
chasuble; the bishop over his chasuble. 196However, for this distinction between a bishop
and priest we have very little evidence. The Canon of III Braga, already cited, which prescribes
that priests shall wear the stole crossed over the breast, presupposes that it is worn
under the chasuble, but the council understands that this method of wearing it pertains
distinctively to priests, and that bishops have another method which they should observe;
for the word sacerdotes, used by the council, includes bishops as well as priests. The rest of
the Spanish ecclesiastical literature gives us no information upon the point. In Gaul, St.
Germanus of Paris (as we have seen) speaks of the episcopal pallium after having described
the chasuble, which makes one believe that it was worn on top. I have already said that
Bishop Ecclesius of Ravenna is represented with the stole pendant before, under the chasuble
and at the same time with the pallium on top of it; and that this usage was adopted in France
in the Carlovingian times. Greek bishops also wear at the same time the epitrachilion and
<note type="footnote">196 What follows down to the next asterisk is a foot-note to p. 379 of Duchesne’s book.</note>

<pb n="302"/>
the omophorion. This accumulation of insignia was forbidden in Spain in the seventh century
(Vide IV Toledo, Canon XXXIX), and (as we have stated) the Pope abstained from it until
about the twelfth century, contenting himself with the pallium without adding to it the
stole.<gap reason="omitted"/></p>
<p>The pallium, with the exception of the crosses which adorn its ends, was always white;
so too was the deacon’s stole and also that of the priest and bishop. The pallium was always
and everywhere made of wool; in the East the deacon’s stole was of linen; I cannot say of
what material the priest’s and deacon’s stole was in the West.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Minor Orders of the Early Church.</head>
<p>(Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, Ignatius, Vol. I., p. 258.)</p>
<p>Some of these lower orders, the subdeacons, readers, door-keepers, and exorcists, are
mentioned in the celebrated letter of Cornelius bishop of Rome (a.d. 251) preserved by Eusebius
(H. E., vi., 43), and the readers existed at least half a century earlier (Tertull., de
Præscr., 41). In the Eastern Church, however, if we except the Apostolic Constitutions, of
which the date and country are uncertain, the first reference to such offices is found in a
canon of the Council of Antioch, a.d. 341, where readers, subdeacons, and exorcists, are
mentioned, this being apparently intended as an exhaustive enumeration of the ecclesiastical
orders below the diaconate; and for the first mention of door-keepers in the East, we must
go to the still later Council of Laodicea, about a.d. 363, (see III., p. 240, for the references,
where also fuller information is given). But while most of these lower orders certainly existed
in the West, and probably in the East, as early as the middle of the third century the case is
different with the “singers” (ψάλται) and the “labourers” (κοπιᾶται). Setting aside the
Apostolic Constitutions, the first notice of the “singers” occurs in the canons of the abovementioned
Council of Laodicea. This, however, may be accidental. The history of the word
copiatai affords a more precise and conclusive indication of date. The term first occurs in
a rescript of Constantius (a.d. 357), “clerici qui copiatai appellantur,” and a little later (a.d.
361), the same emperor speaks of them as “hi quos copiatas recens usus instituit nuncupari.”</p>
<p>(Adolf Harnack, in his little book ridiculously intituled in the English version Sources
of the Apostolic Canons, page 85.)</p>
<p>Exorcists and readers there had been in the Church from old times, subdeacons are not
essentially strange, as they participate in a name (deacon) which dates from the earliest days
of Christianity. But acolytes and door-keepers (πυλωροί) are quite strange, are really novelties.
And these acolytes even at the time of Cornelius stand at the head of the ordines
minores: for that the subdeacons follow on the deacons is self-evident. Whence do they
come? Now if they do not spring out of the Christian tradition, their origin must be explained
from the Roman. It can in fact be shown there with desirable plainness.</p>
<p>With regard to subdeacons the reader may also like to see some of Harnack’s speculations.
In the volume just quoted he writes as follows (p. 85 note):</p>
<p>According to Cornelius and Cyprian subdeacons were mentioned in the thirtieth canon
of the Synod of Elvira (about 305), so that the sub diaconate must then have been acknowledged
as a fixed general institution in the whole west (see Dale, The Synod of Elvira, Lond.,
1882). The same is seen in the “gesta apud Zenophilum.” As the appointment of the lower
orders took place at Rome between about the years 222–249, the announcement in the Liber

<pb n="306"/>
Pontificalis (see Duchesne’s edition, fasc. 2, 1885, p. 148) is not to be despised, as according
to it Bishop Fabian appointed seven subdeacons: “Hic regiones dividit diaconibus et fecit
vii. subdiaconos.” The Codex Liberianus indeed (see Duchesne, fasc. 1, pp. 4 and 5; Lipsius,
Chronologie d. röm Bischöfe, p. 267), only contains the first half of the sentence, and what
the Liber Pontif. has added of the account of the appointment of subdeacons (…qui vii
notariis imminerent, ut gestas martyrum in integro fideliter colligerent) is, in spite of the
explanation of Duchesne, not convincing. According to Probst and other Catholic scholars
the subdiaconate existed in Rome a long time before Fabian (Kirchl. Disciplin, p. 109), but
Hippolytus is against them. Besides, it should be observed that the officials first, even in
Carthage, are called hypo-deacons, though the word subdiaconus was by degrees used in
the West. This also points to a Roman origin of the office, for in the Roman church in the
first part of the third century the Greek language was the prevailing one, but not at Carthage.</p>
<p>But to return to the Acolythes, and door-keepers, whom Harnack thinks to be copies
of the old Roman temple officers. He refers to Marquardt’s explanation of the sacrificial
system of the Romans, and gives the following resumé (page 85 et seqq.):</p>
<p>1. The temples have only partially their own priests, but they all have a superintendent
(oedituus-curator templi). These oeditui, who lived in the temple, fall again into two classes.
At least “in the most important brotherhoods the chosen oedituus was not in a position to
undertake in person the watching and cleaning of the sacellum. He charged therefore with
this service a freedman or slave.” “In this case the sacellum had two oeditui, the templekeeper,
originally called magister oedituus, and the temple-servant, who appears to be called
the oedituus minister.” “To both it is common that they live in the temple, although in small
chapels the presence of the servant is sufficient. The temple-servant opens, shuts, and cleans
the sacred place, and shows to strangers its curiosities, and allows, according to the rules of
the temple, those persons to offer up prayers and sacrifices to whom this is permitted, while
he sends away the others.”</p>
<p>2. “Besides the endowment, the colleges of priests were also supplied with a body of
servants”—the under officials—; “they were appointed to the priests,<gap reason="omitted"/>by all of whom they
were used partly as letter-carriers (tabellarii), partly as scribes, partly as assistants at the
sacrifices.” Marquardt reckons, (page 218 and fol.) the various categories of them among
the sacerdotes publici, lictores, pullarii, victimarii, tibicines, viatores, sixthly the calatores,
in the priests’ colleges free men or freedmen, not slaves, and in fact one for the personal
service of each member.</p>
<p>Here we have the forerunners of the Church door-keepers and acolytes. Thus says the
fourth Council of Carthage, as far as refers to the former: “Ostiarius cum ordinatur,
postquam ab archidiacono instructus fuerit, qualiter in domo dei debeat conversari, ad
suggestionem archidiaconi, tradat ei episcopus claves ecclesiæ de altari, dicens. Sic age,

<pb n="307"/>
quasi redditurus deo rationem pro his rebus, quæ hisce clavibus recluduntur.” The ostiarius
(πυλωρός) is thus the ædituus minister. He had to look after the opening and shutting of
the doors, to watch over the coming in and going out of the faithful, to refuse entrance to
suspicious persons, and, from the date of the more strict separation between the missa catechumenorum
and the missa fidelium, to close the doors, after the dismissal of the catechumens,
against those doing penance and unbelievers. He first became necessary when there
were special church buildings (there were such even in the second century), and they like
the temples, together with the ceremonial of divine service, had come to be considered as
holy, that is, since about 225. The church acolytes are without difficulty to be recognised
in the under officials of the priests, especially in the “calatores,” the personal servants of the
priests. According to Cyprian the acolytes and others are used by preference as tabellarii.
According to Cornelius there were in Rome forty-two acolytes. As he gives the number of
priests as forty-six, it may be concluded with something like certainty that the rule was that
the number of the priests and of the acolytes should be equal, and that the little difference
may have been caused by temporary vacancies. If this view is correct, the identity of the
calator with the acolyte is strikingly proved. But the name “acolyte” plainly shows the acolyte
was not, like the door-keeper, attached to a sacred thing, but to a sacred person.</p>
<p>(Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, Ignatius, ad Antioch, xj., note. Vol. II., Sec. II., p. 240.)</p>
<p>The acolytes were confined to the Western Church and so are not mentioned here. On
the other hand the “deaconesses” seem to have been confined to the Eastern Church at this
time. See also Apost. Const., iii., 11.; viii., 12; comp. viii., 19–28, 31; Apost. Can., 43; Conc.
Laodic., Can. 24; Conc. Antioch, Can. 10. Of these lower orders the “subdeacons” are first
mentioned in the middle of the third century, in the passage of Cornelius already quoted
and in the contemporary letters of Cyprian. The “readers” occur as early as Tertullian de
Præscr. 41 “hodie diaconus, qui cras lector,” where the language shows that this was already
a firmly established order in the Church. Of the “singers” the notices in the Apostolical
Constitutions are probably the most ancient. The “door-keepers,” like the sub-deacons,
seem to be first mentioned in the letter of Cornelius. The κοπιῶντες first appear a full
century later; see the next note. The “exorcists,” as we have seen, are mentioned as a distinct
order by Cornelius, while in Apost. Const., viii., 26, it is ordered that they shall not be ordained,
because it is a spiritual function which comes direct from God and manifests itself
by its results. The name and the function, however, appear much earlier in the Christian
Church; e.g., Justin Mart., Apol. ii., 6 (p. 45). The forms ἐπορκιστὴς and ἐξορκιστὴς are
convertible; e.g., Justin Mart., Dial., 85 (p. 311). The “confessors” hardly deserve to be
reckoned a distinct order, though accidentally they are mentioned in proximity with the
different grades of clergy in Apost. Const., viii., 12, already quoted. Perhaps the accidental
connexion in this work has led to their confusion with the offices of the Christian ministry

<pb n="308"/>
in our false Ignatius. In Apost. Const., viii., 23, they are treated in much the same way as
the exorcists, being regarded as in some sense an order and yet not subject to ordination.
Possibly, however, the word ὁμολογηταὶ has here a different sense, “chanters,” as the corresponding
Latin “confessores” seems sometimes to have, e.g., in the Sacramentary of Gregory
“Oremus et pro omnibus episcopis, presbyteris, diaconibus, acolythis, exorcistis, lectoribus,
ostiariis, confessoribus, virginibus, viduis, et pro omni populo sancto Dei;” see Ducange,
Gloss. Lat., s.v. (11. p. 530, Henschel).</p>
<p>In a law of the year 357 (Cod. Theod., xiii., 1) mention is made of “clerici qui copiatæ
appellantur,” and another law of the year 361 (Cod. Theod. xvi., 2, 15) runs “clerici vero vel
his quos copiatas recens usus instituit nuncupari,” etc. From these passages it is clear that
the name κοπιῶντες was not in use much before the middle of the fourth century, though
the office under its Latin name “fossores” or “fossarii” appears somewhat earlier. Even later
Epiphanius (Expos. Fid., 21) writes as if the word still needed some explanation. In accordance
with these facts, Zahn (I. v., A. p. 129), correctly argues with regard to our Ignatian
writer, urging that on the one hand he would not have ascribed such language to Ignatius
if the word had been quite recent, while on the other hand his using the participle (τοὺς
κοπιῶντας) rather than the substantive indicates that it had not yet firmly established itself.
For these “copiatæ” see especially de Rossi, Roma Sotteranea, III., p. 533 sq., Gothofred on
Cod. Theod., II., cc., and for the Latin “fossores” Martigny, Dict. des Antiq. Chrét. s.v. See

of doing so, contended that as they did not do it in church but only at home, they could not
be considered as deserving of any punishment. For this reason the Fathers rule that even
to “adjure” (ἐφορκίζειν) is an ecclesiastical ministry, and must not be executed by anyone
who shall not have been promoted thereto by a bishop. But the “Exorcist” must be excepted
who has been promoted by a Chorepiscopus, for he can indeed properly catechize although
not promoted by a bishop; for from Canon X. of Antioch we learn that even a Chorepiscopus
can make an Exorcist.</p>
<p>Zonaras notes that from this canon it appears that “Chorepiscopi are considered to be
in the number of bishops.”</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>“Promoted” (προαχθέντας ) by the bishops, by which is signified a mere designation
or appointment, in conformity with the Greek discipline which never counted exorcism
among the orders, but among the simple ministries which were committed to certain persons
by the bishops, as Morinus proves at length in his work on Orders (De Ordinationibus, Pars
III., Ex. XIV., cap. ij.).</p>
<p>Double is the power of devils over men, the one part internal the other external. The
former is when they hold the soul captive by vice and sin. The latter when they disturb the
exterior and interior senses and lead anyone on to fury. Those who are subject to the interior
evils are the Catechumens and Penitents, and those who are subject to the exterior are the
Energumens. Whoever are occupied with the freeing from the power of the devil of either
of these kinds, by prayers, exhortations, and exorcisms, are said “to exorcize” them; which
seems to be what Balsamon means when he says—“‘exorcize’ that is ‘to catechize the unbelievers.’”

<p>Van Espen translates: “no one holding any office in the Church, be he cleric or layman,”
and appeals to the fact that already in early times among the Greeks many held offices in
the Church without being ordained, as do now our sacristans and acolytes. I do not think,
however, with Van Espen, that by “they of the priesthood” is meant in general any one
holding office in the Church, but only the higher ranks of the clergy, priests and deacons,
as in the preceding twenty-fourth canon the presbyters and deacons alone are expressly
numbered among the ἱερατικοῖς and distinguished from the other (minor) clerics. And
afterwards, in canon XXX., there is a similar mention of three different grades, ἱερατικοί,
κληρικοί, and ἀσκηταί.</p>

<p>Christians must not forsake the Church of God, and go away and invoke angels and

in this covert idolatry, let him be anathema; for he has forsaken our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, and has gone over to idolatry.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXV.</p>
<p>Whoso calls assemblies in opposition to those of the Church and names angels, is near to
idolatry and let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Whatever the worship of angels condemned by this canon may have been, one thing is
manifest, that it was a species of idolatry, and detracted from the worship due to Christ.</p>
<p>Theodoret makes mention of this superstitious cult in his exposition of the Text of St.
Paul, Col. ii. 18, and when writing of its condemnation by this synod he says, “they were
leading to worship angels such as were defending the Law; for, said they, the Law was given
through angels. And this vice lasted for a long time in Phrygia and Pisidia. Therefore it
was that the synod which met at Laodicea in Phrygia, prohibited by a canon, that prayer
should be offered to angels, and even to-day an oratory of St. Michael can be seen among
them, and their neighbours.”</p>
<p>In the Capitular of Charlemagne, a.d. 789 (cap. xvi.), it is said, “In that same council
(Laodicea) it was ordered that angels should not be given unknown names, and that such
should not be affixed to them, but that only they should be named by the names which we
have by authority. These are Michael, Gabriel, Raphael.” And then is subjoined the present
canon. The canon forbids “to name” (ὀνομάζειν) angels, and this was understood as
meaning to give them names instead of to call upon them by name.</p>
<p>Perchance the authors of the Capitular had in mind the Roman Council under Pope
Zachary, a.d. 745, against Aldebert, who was found to invoke by name eight angels in his
prayers.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some Latin versions of great authority and antiquity read angulos
for angelos. This would refer to doing these idolatrous rites in corners, hiddenly, secretly,
occulte as in the Latin. But this reading, though so respectable in the Latin, has no Greek
authority for it.</p>

<pb n="321"/>
<p>This canon has often been used in controversy as condemning the cultus which the
Catholic Church has always given to the angels, but those who would make such a use of
this canon should explain how these interpretations can be consistent with the cultus of the
Martyrs so evidently approved by the same council; and how this canon came to be accepted
by the Fathers of the Second Council of Nice, if it condemned the then universal practice
of the Church, East and West. Cf. Forbes, Considerationes Modestæ.</p>

<p>It is well known that according to the true discipline of the Church no one should be
ordained unless he be attached to some church, which as an ecclesiastical soldier he shall
fight for and preserve. As, then, a secular soldier cannot without his prefect’s bidding leave
his post and go to another, so the canons decree that no one in the ranks of the ecclesiastical
military can travel about except at the bidding of the bishop who is in command of the
army. A slight trace of this discipline is observed even to-day in the fact that priests of other
dioceses are not allowed to celebrate unless they are provided with Canonical letters or
testimonials from their own bishops.</p>

<p>The whole subject of Commendatory and other letters is treated of in the note to Canon

litany outside the Holy Gates while the priest was going on with the holy action within,
subdeacons may have left their places at the doors, assumed the deacon’s stole and done his

“prayer” being the litany. But as this is purely my own suggestion it is probably valueless.</p>

<p>After two weeks of Lent no one must be admitted for illumination, for all such should fast

<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>To the understanding of this canon it must be remembered that such of the Gentiles as
desired to become Catholics and to be baptized, at first were privately instructed by the
catechists. After this, having acquired some knowledge of the Christian religion, they were
admitted to the public instructions given by the bishop in church; and were therefore called
Audientes and for the first time properly-speaking Catechumens. But when these catechumens
had been kept in this rank a sufficient time and had been there tried, they were allowed
to go up to the higher grade called Genuflectentes.</p>
<p>And when their exercises had been completed in this order they were brought by the
catechists who had had the charge of them, to the bishop, that on the Holy Sabbath <del>Easter
Even</del> they might receive baptism, and the catechumens gave their names at the same time,
so that they might be set down for baptism at the coming Holy Sabbath.</p>
<p>Moreover we learn from St. Augustine (Serm. xiii., Ad Neophitos,) that the time for the
giving in of the names was the beginning of Lent.</p>
<p>This council therefore in this canon decrees that such as do not hand in their names at
the beginning of Lent, but after two weeks are past, shall not be admitted to baptism on the
next Holy Sabbath.</p>

<p>Some unbelievers were baptized before they had been catechized, by reason of the urgency

catechumens, they ought to be catechized and baptized over again. And in support of this
opinion they urged Canon XII. of Neocæsarea, which does not permit one clinically baptized
to become a priest rashly. For this reason it is that the Fathers decree that such an one shall
not be baptized a second time, but as soon as he gets well he shall learn the faith and the
mystery of baptism, and to appreciate the divine gifts he has received, viz., the confession
of the one true God and the remission of sins which comes to us in holy baptism.</p>

<p>That this canon refers to the anointing with chrism on the forehead of the baptized,

slightest study to the point. To produce the evidence here would be out of place, but the
reader may be referred to the excellent presentation of it in Cardinal Bona’s De Rebus
Liturgicis.</p>
<p>I shall here cite but one passage, from St. Augustine:</p>
<p>“It is clear that when the disciples first received the body and blood of the Lord they
had not been fasting. Must we then censure the Universal Church because the sacrament
is everywhere partaken of by persons fasting? Nay, verily; for from that time it pleased the
Holy Spirit to appoint, for the honour of so great a sacrament, that the body of the Lord
should take the precedence of all other food entering the mouth of a Christian; and it is for
this reason that the custom referred to is universally observed. For the fact that the Lord
instituted the sacrament after other food had been partaken of does not prove that brethren
should come together to partake of that sacrament after having dined or supped, or imitate
those whom the Apostle reproved and corrected for not distinguishing between the Lord’s
Supper and an ordinary meal. The Saviour, indeed, in order to commend the depths of that
mystery more affectingly to his disciples, was pleased to impress it on their hearts and
memories by making its institution his last act before going from them to his passion. And,
therefore, he did not prescribe the order in which it was to be observed, reserving this to be
done by the Apostles, through whom he intended to arrange all things pertaining to the
churches. Had he appointed that the sacrament should be always partaken of after other
food, I believe that no one would have departed from that practice. But when the Apostle,
speaking of this sacrament, says, ‘Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat,
tarry one for another, and if any man hunger let him eat at home, that ye come not together
unto condemnation,’ he immediately adds, ‘And the rest will I set in order when I come.’
Whence we are given to understand that, since it was too much for him to prescribe completely
in an epistle the method observed by the Universal Church throughout the world it

<pb n="337"/>
was one of the things set in order by him in person; for we find its observance uniform amid
all the variety of other customs.”198</p>
<p>In fact the utter absurdity of the attempt to maintain the opposite cannot better be seen
than in reading Kingdon’s Fasting Communion, an example of special pleading and disingenuousness
rarely equalled even in controversial theological literature. A brief but crushing
refutation of the position taken by that writer will be found in an appendix to a pamphlet
by H. P. Liddon, Evening Communions contrary to the Teaching and Practice of the Church
in all Ages.</p>
<p>But while this is true, it is also true that in some few places the custom had lingered on
of making Maundy Thursday night an exception to this rule, and of having then a feast, in
memory of our Lord’s Last Supper, and after this having a celebration of the Divine Mysteries.
This is the custom which is prohibited by this canon, but it is manifest both from the
wording of the canon itself and from the remarks of the Greek commentators that the custom
was condemned not because it necessitated an unfasting reception of the Holy Eucharist,
but because it connoted a feast which was a breaking of the Lenten fast and a dishonour to
the whole of the holy season.</p>
<p>It is somewhat curious and a trifle amusing to read Zonaras gravely arguing the point
as to whether the drinking of water is forbidden by this canon because it speaks of “dry
meats,” which he decides in the negative!</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>Those, therefore, who without being ill, fast on oil and shell-fish, do contrary to this
law; and much more they who eat on the fourth and sixth ferias fish.</p>

<p>Several heretics, for instance Bardesanes, Paul of Samosata, and Apollinaris—had
composed psalms, i.e., Church hymns. The Synod of Laodicea forbade the use of any

that by this it was not intended to forbid the use of all but the Bible psalms and hymns, for
it is known that even after this Synod many hymns composed by individual Christians, for
instance, Prudentius, Clement, Ambrose, came into use in the Church. Only those not
sanctioned were to be banished.</p>
<p>This idea was greatly exaggerated by some Gallicans in the seventeenth century who
wished that all the Antiphons, etc., should be in the words of Holy Scripture. A learned but

<p>It will be noticed that while this canon has often been used for controversial purposes
it really has little or no value in this connexion, for the absence of the Revelation of St. John
from the New Testament to all orthodox Christians is, to say the least, as fatal to its reception
as an ecumenical definition of the canon of Holy Scripture, as the absence of the book of
Wisdom, etc., from the Old Testament is to its reception by those who accept the books of
what we may call for convenience the Greek canon, as distinguished from the Hebrew, as
canonical.</p>
<p>We may therefore leave this question wholly out of account, and merely consider the
matter from the evidence we possess.</p>

<pb n="348"/>
<p>In 1777 Spittler published a special treatise199 to shew that the list of scriptural books
was no part of the original canon adopted by Laodicea. Hefele gives the following resume
of his argument:200</p>
<p>(a) That Dionysius Exiguus has not this canon in his translation of the Laodicean decrees.
It might, indeed, be said with Dallæus and Van Espen, that Dionysius omitted this
list of the books of Scripture because in Rome, where he composed his work, another by
Innocent I. was in general use.</p>
<p>(b) But, apart from the fact that Dionysius is always a most faithful translator, this sixtieth
canon is also omitted by John of Antioch, one of the most esteemed and oldest Greek
collectors of canons, who could have had no such reasons as Dionysius for his omission.</p>
<p>(c) Lastly, Bishop Martin of Braga in the sixth century, though he has the fifty-ninth,
has also not included in his collection the sixtieth canon so nearly related to it, nor does the
Isidorian translation appear at first to have had this canon.201 Herbst, in the Tübingen Review,
also accedes to these arguments of Spittler’s, as did Fuchs and others before him. Mr.
Ffoulkes in his article on the Council of Laodicea in Smith and Cheetham’s Dictionary of
Christian Antiquities at length attempts to refute all objections, and affirms the genuineness
of the list, but his conclusions can hardly be accepted when the careful consideration and
discussion of the matter by Bishop Westcott is kept in mind. (History of the Canon of the

<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>In the whole history of the Church there is no council which bristles with such astonishing
facts as the First Council of Constantinople. It is one of the “undisputed General
Councils,” one of the four which St. Gregory said he revered as he did the four holy Gospels,
and he would be rash indeed who denied its right to the position it has so long occupied;
and yet</p>
<p>1. It was not intended to be an Ecumenical Synod at all.</p>
<p>2. It was a local gathering of only one hundred and fifty bishops.</p>
<p>3. It was not summoned by the Pope, nor was he invited to it.</p>
<p>4. No diocese of the West was present either by representation or in the person of its
bishop; neither the see of Rome, nor any other see.</p>
<p>5. It was a council of Saints, Cardinal Orsi, the Roman Historian, says: “Besides St.
Gregory of Nyssa, and St. Peter of Sebaste, there were also at Constantinople on account of
the Synod many other Bishops, remarkable either for the holiness of their life, or for their
zeal for the faith, or for their learning, or for the eminence of their Sees, as St. Amphilochius
of Iconium, Helladius of Cesarea in Cappadocia, Optimus of Antioch in Pisidia, Diodorus
of Tarsus, St. Pelagius of Laodicea, St. Eulogius of Edessa, Acacius of Berea, Isidorus of
Cyrus, St. Cyril of Jerusalem, Gelasius of Cesarea in Palestine, Vitus of Carres, Dionysius
of Diospolis, Abram of Batnes, and Antiochus of Samosata, all three Confessors, Bosphorus
of Colonia, and Otreius of Melitina, and various others whose names appear with honour
in history. So that perhaps there has not been a council, in which has been found a greater
number of Confessors and of Saints.”203</p>
<p>6. It was presided over at first by St. Meletius, the bishop of Antioch who was bishop
not in communion with Rome,204 who died during its session and was styled a Saint in the
panegyric delivered over him and who has since been canonized as a Saint of the Roman
Church by the Pope.</p>
<p>7. Its second president was St. Gregory Nazianzen, who was at that time liable to censure
for a breach of the canons which forbade his translation to Constantinople.</p>
<note type="footnote">203 Orsi, Ist. Eccl., xviii., 63.</note>
<note type="footnote">204 E. B. Pusey. The Councils of the Church, a.d. 51–381, p. 306. Tillemont, Mémoires, xvj., 662, who says,
“If none of those who die out of communion with Rome can merit the title of Saints and Confessors, Baronius
should have the names of St. Meletius, St. Elias of Jerusalem and St. Daniel the Stylite stricken from the Martyrology.”
Cf. F. W. Puller, The Primitive Saints and See of Rome, pp. 174 and 238. Many attempts have been made
to explain this fact away, but without success. Not only was the president of the Council a persona non grata to
the Pope, but the members of the Council were well aware of the fact, and much pleased that such was the case, and Hefele acknowledges that the reason the council determined to continue the Meletian Schism was because allowing Paulinus to succeed to Meletius would be “too great a concession to the Latins” (vol. III., p. 346).</note>

<pb n="351"/>
<p>8. Its action in continuing the Meletian Schism was condemned at Rome, and its Canons
rejected for a thousand years.</p>
<p>9. Its canons were not placed in their natural position after those of Nice in the codex
which was used at the Council of Chalcedon, although this was an Eastern codex.</p>
<p>10. Its Creed was not read nor mentioned, so far as the acts record, at the Council of
Ephesus, fifty years afterwards.</p>
<p>11. Its title to being (as it undoubtedly is) the Second of the Ecumenical Synods rests
upon its Creed having found a reception in the whole world. And now—mirabile dictu—an
English scholar comes forward, ready to defend the proposition that the First Council of
Constantinople never set forth any creed at all!205</p>
<note type="footnote">205 F. J. A. Hort, Two Dissertations. I. On μονογένης Θέος in Scripture and tradition, II. On the Constantinopolitan
Creed and other Eastern Creeds of the 4th Century. It should be added that Dr. Hort acknowledges that,
“we may well believe that they [i.e. the 150 fathers of Constantinople] had expressed approval” of the creed ordinarily
attributed to them (p. 115). The whole dissertation is a fine example of what Dr. Salmon so well called
Dr. Hort’s “perfervidum ingenium as an advocate,” and of his “exaggeration of judgment.” (Salmon. Criticism
of the Text of the New Testament, p. 12, also see p. 34.) Swainson, in his The Nicene and Apostles’ Creeds, has all the material points found in Hort’s Dissertation. Harnack goes much further. He is of opinion that the Creed
of Constantinople (as we call it), the Creed which has been the symbol of orthodoxy for fifteen hundred years,
is really a Semi-Arian, anti-Nicene, and quasi Macedonian confession! The first contention he supports, not without a show of plausibility, by the fact that it omits the words (which were really most crucial) “that is to say
of the substance of the Father.” In support of the second opinion he writes as follows: “The words [with regard to the Holy Ghost] are in entire harmony with the form which the doctrine of the Holy Spirit had in the sixties. A Pneumatochian could have subscribed this formula at a pinch; and just because of this it is certain that the
Council of 381 did not accept this creed.” Some scholars arrive at “certainty” more easily than others, even
Harnack himself only attains this “certainty” in the foot-note! The reader will remark that what Harnack is
“certain ”of in the foot-note is that the Council “did not accept” this creed, not that it “did not frame” it, which
is entirely a different question. (Adolf Harnack, History of Dogma, [Eng. Trans.], Vol. iv., p. 99.)</note>

<head>The Holy Creed Which the 150 Holy Fathers Set Forth, Which is Consonant with the Holy and Great Synod of Nice206.</head>
<p>(Found in all the Collections in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon.)</p>
<p>Introductory Note.</p>
<p>The reader should know that Tillemont (Mémoires, t. ix., art. 78 in the treatise on St.
Greg. Naz.) broached the theory that the Creed adopted at Constantinople was not a new
expansion of the Nicene but rather the adoption of a Creed already in use. Hefele is of the
same opinion (Hist. of the Councils, II., p. 349), and the learned Professor of Divinity in the
University of Jena, Dr. Lipsius, says, of St. Epiphanius: “Though not himself present at the
Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, a.d. 381, which ensured the triumph of the Nicene
doctrine in the Oriental Churches, his shorter confession of faith, which is found at the end
of his Ancoratus, and seems to have been the baptismal creed of the Church of Salamis,
agrees almost word for word with the Constantinopolitan formula.” (Smith and Wace, Dict.
Chr. Biog., s.v. Epiphanius). “The Ancoratus,” St. Epiphanius distinctly tells us, was written
as early as a.d. 374, and toward the end of chapter cxix., he writes as follows. “The children
of the Church have received from the holy fathers, that is from the holy Apostles, the faith
to keep, and to hand down, and to teach their children. To these children you belong, and
I beg you to receive it and pass it on. And whilst you teach your children these things and
such as these from the holy Scriptures, cease not to confirm and strengthen them, and indeed
all who hear you: tell them that this is the holy faith of the Holy Catholic Church, as the
one holy Virgin of God received it from the holy Apostles of the Lord to keep: and thus
every person who is in preparation for the holy laver of baptism must learn it: they must
learn it themselves, and teach it expressly, as the one Mother of all, of you and of us, proclaims
it, saying.” Then follows the Creed as on page 164.</p>
<p>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth and of all things
visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten
of his Father before all worlds, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made,
being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. Who for us men
and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost and
the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.
He suffered and was buried, and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures,
and ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the Right Hand of the Father. And he shall come

(I)</p>
<p>And <del>we believe</del> in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver-of-Life, who proceedeth from
the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake
by the prophets. And <del>we believe</del> in one, holy, (II) Catholic and Apostolic Church. We
acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins, <del>and</del> we look for the resurrection of

<p>Note I.</p>
<p>This clause had already, so far as the meaning is concerned, been added to the Nicene
Creed, years before, in correction of the heresy of Marcellus of Ancyra, of whose heresy a
statement will be found in the notes on Canon I. of this Council. One of the creeds of the
Council of Antioch in Encæniis (a.d. 341) reads: “and he sitteth at the right hand of the
Father, and he shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead, and he remaineth
God and King to all eternity.”207</p>

the collection of Isidore Mercator. Vide Labbe, Conc., II., 960. Cf. Creed in English Prayer-

<p>We believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things

of the Father before all worlds, that is of the substance of the Father, Light of Light, very
God of very God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father: by whom all things
were made, both in heaven and earth: who for us men and for our salvation came down
from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, and was made man,
was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried, and on the third
day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the
right hand of the Father, and from thence he shall come again with glory to judge both the

quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord
and Giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father; who, with the Father and the Son together
is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the prophets: in one holy Catholic and
Apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; we look for the
resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. And those who say that there
was a time when the Son of God was not, and before he was begotten he was not, or that he
was of things which are not, or that he is of a different hypostasis or substance, or pretend
that he is effluent or changeable, these the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.</p>
<p>Epiphanius thus continues:</p>
<p>“And this faith was delivered from the Holy Apostles and in the Church, the Holy City,
from all the Holy Bishops together more than three hundred and ten in number.”</p>
<p>“In our generation, that is in the times of Valentinus and Valens, and the ninetieth year
from the succession of Diocletian the tyrant,209 you and we and all the orthodox bishops
of the whole Catholic Church together, make this address to those who come to baptism,
in order that they may proclaim and say as follows:”</p>
<p>Epiphanius then gives this creed:</p>
<p>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things, invisible and visible.
And in one Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, begotten of God the Father, only begotten,
that is of the substance of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God,
begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made,
both which be in heaven and in earth, whether they be visible or invisible. Who for us men
and for our salvation came down, and was incarnate, that is to say was conceived perfectly
through the Holy Ghost of the holy ever-virgin Mary, and was made man, that is to say a
perfect man, receiving a soul, and body, and intellect, and all that make up a man, but
without sin, not from human seed, nor [that he dwelt] in a man, but taking flesh to himself
into one holy entity; not as he inspired the prophets and spake and worked <del>in them</del>, but
was perfectly made man, for the Word was made flesh; neither did he experience any change,
nor did he convert his divine nature into the nature of man, but united it to his one holy
perfection and Divinity.</p>
<p>For there is one Lord Jesus Christ, not two, the same is God, the same is Lord, the same
is King. He suffered in the flesh, and rose again, and ascended into heaven in the same body,
and with glory he sat down at the right hand of the Father, and in the same body he will
come in glory to judge both the quick and the dead, and of his kingdom there shall be no
end.</p>
<note type="footnote">209 This would be the year 374, that is to say seven years before this Second Ecumenical Council which was
held at Constantinople in 381.</note>

<pb n="355"/>
<p>And we believe in the Holy Ghost, who spake in the Law, and preached in the Prophets,
and descended at Jordan, and spake in the Apostles, and indwells the Saints. And thus we
believe in him, that he is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the perfect Spirit, the Spirit the
Comforter, uncreate, who proceedeth from the Father, receiving of the Son (ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς
ἐκπορευόμενον, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Υἱοῦ λαμβανόμενον), and believed on. (καὶ πιστευόμενον,
which the Latin version gives in quem credimus; and proceeds to insert, Præterea credimus
in unam, etc. It certainly looks as if it had read πιστεύομεν, and had belonged to the following
phrase.)</p>
<p><del>We believe</del> in one Catholic and Apostolic Church. And in one baptism of penitence,
and in the resurrection of the dead, and the just judgment of souls and bodies, and in the
Kingdom of heaven and in life everlasting.</p>
<p>And those who say that there was a time when the Son was not, or when the Holy Ghost
was not, or that either was made of that which previously had no being, or that he is of a
different nature or substance, and affirm that the Son of God and the Holy Spirit are subject
to change and mutation; all such the Catholic and Apostolic Church, the mother both of
you and of us, anathematizes. And further we anathematize such as do not confess the resurrection
of the dead, as well as all heresies which are not in accord with the true faith.</p>
<p>Finally, you and your children thus believing and keeping the commandments of this
same faith, we trust that you will always pray for us, that we may have a share and lot in that
same faith and in the keeping of these same commandments. For us make your intercessions,
you and all who believe thus, and keep the commandments of the Lord in our Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom and with whom, glory be to the Father with the Holy Spirit for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Historical Excursus on the Introduction into the Creed of the Words
“and the Son.”</head>
<p>The introduction into the Nicene Creed of the words “and the Son” (Filioque) has given
rise to, or has been the pretext for, such bitter reviling between East and West (during which
many statements unsupported by fact have become more or less commonly believed) that
I think it well in this place to set forth as dispassionately as possible the real facts of the case.
I shall briefly then give the proof of the following propositions:</p>
<p>1. That no pretence is made by the West that the words in dispute formed part of the
original creed as adopted at Constantinople, or that they now form part of that Creed.</p>
<p>2. That so far from the insertion being made by the Pope, it was made in direct opposition
to his wishes and command.</p>
<p>3. That it never was intended by the words to assert that there were two ’Αρχαὶ in the
Trinity, nor in any respect on this point to differ from the teaching of the East.</p>
<p>4. That it is quite possible that the words were not an intentional insertion at all.</p>
<p>5. And finally that the doctrine of the East as set forth by St. John Damascene is now
and always has been the doctrine of the West on the procession of the Holy Spirit, however
much through ecclesiastico-political contingencies this fact may have become obscured.</p>
<p>With the truth or falsity of the doctrine set forth by the Western addition to the creed
this work has no concern, nor even am I called upon to treat the historical question as to
when and where the expression “and the Son” was first used. For a temperate and eminently
scholarly treatment of this point from a Western point of view, I would refer the reader to
Professor Swete’s On the History of the Doctrine of the Procession of the Holy Spirit. In J. M.
Neale’s History of the Holy Eastern Church will be found a statement from the opposite point
of view. The great treatises of past years I need not mention here, but may be allowed to
enter a warning to the reader, that they were often written in the period of hot controversy,
and make more for strife than for peace, magnifying rather than lessening differences both
of thought and expression.</p>
<p>Perhaps, too, I may be allowed here to remind the readers that it has been said that while
“ex Patre Filioque procedens” in Latin does not necessitate a double source of the Holy
Spirit, the expression ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Υἱοῦ does. On such a point
I am not fit to give an opinion, but St. John Damascene does not use this expression.</p>
<p>1. That no pretence is made by the West that the words in dispute ever formed part of
the creed as adopted at Constantinople is evidently proved by the patent fact that it is printed
without those words in all our Concilias and in all our histories. It is true that at the Council
of Florence it was asserted that the words were found in a copy of the Acts of the Seventh
Ecumenical which they had, but no stress was even at that eminently Western council laid
upon the point, which even if it had been the case would have shewn nothing with regard

<pb n="357"/>
to the true reading of the Creed as adopted by the Second Synod.210 On this point there
never was nor can be any doubt.</p>
<p>2. The addition was not made at the will and at the bidding of the Pope. It has frequently
been said that it was a proof of the insufferable arrogancy of the See of Rome that it dared
to tamper with the creed set forth by the authority of an Ecumenical Synod and which had
been received by the world. Now so far from the history of this addition to the creed being
a ground of pride and complacency to the advocates of the Papal claims, it is a most marked
instance of the weakness of the papal power even in the West.</p>
<p>“Baronius,” says Dr. Pusey, “endeavours in vain to find any Pope, to whom the ‘formal
addition’ may be ascribed, and rests at last on a statement of a writer towards the end of the
12th century, writing against the Greeks. ‘If the Council of Constantinople added to the
Nicene Creed, ‘in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, and Giver of life,’ and the Council of Chalcedon
to that of Constantinople, ‘perfect in Divinity and perfect in Humanity, consubstantial with
the Father as touching his Godhead, consubstantial with us as touching his manhood,’ and
some other things as aforesaid, the Bishop of the elder Rome ought not to be calumniated,
because for explanation, he added one word [that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son]
having the consent of very many bishops and most learned Cardinals.’ ‘For the truth of
which,’ says Le Quien, ‘be the author responsible!’ It seems to me inconceivable, that all
account of any such proceeding, if it ever took place, should have been lost.”211</p>
<p>We may then dismiss this point and briefly review the history of the matter.</p>
<p>There seems little doubt that the words were first inserted in Spain. As early as the year
400 it had been found necessary at a Council of Toledo to affirm the double procession
against the Priscillianists,212 and in 589 by the authority of the Third Council of Toledo the
newly converted Goths were required to sign the creed with the addition.213 From this time
it became for Spain the accepted form, and was so recited at the Eighth Council of Toledo
in 653, and again in 681 at the Twelfth Council of Toledo.214</p>
<note type="footnote">210 In fact the contention of the Latins was that the words were inserted by II. Nice! To this the Easterns
answered most pertinently “Why did you not tell us this long ago?” They were not so fortunate when they insisted
that St. Thomas would have quoted it, for some scholars have thought St. Thomas but ill acquainted with the
proceedings at the Seventh Synod. Vide Hefele, Concil. XLVIII., § 810.</note>

<pb n="358"/>
<p>But this was at first only true of Spain, and at Rome nothing of the kind was known.
In the Gelasian Sacramentary the Creed is found in its original form.215 The same is the
case with the old Gallican Sacramentary of the viith or viiith century.216</p>
<p>However, there can be no doubt that its introduction spread very rapidly through the
West and that before long it was received practically everywhere except at Rome.</p>
<p>In 809 a council was held at Aix-la-Chapelle by Charlemagne, and from it three divines
were sent to confer with the Pope, Leo III, upon the subject. The Pope opposed the insertion
of the Filioque on the express ground that the General Councils had forbidden any addition
to be made to their formulary.217 Later on, the Frankish Emperor asked his bishops what
was “the meaning of the Creed according to the Latins,”218 and Fleury gives the result of
the investigations to have been, “In France they continued to chant the creed with the word
Filioque, and at Rome they continued not to chant it.”219</p>
<p>So firmly resolved was the Pope that the clause should not be introduced into the creed
that he presented two silver shields to the Confessio in St. Peter’s at Rome, on one of which
was engraved the creed in Latin and on the other in Greek, without the addition. This act
the Greeks never forgot during the controversy. Photius refers to it in writing to the Patriarch
of Acquileia. About two centuries later St. Peter Damian220 mentions them as still in place;
and about two centuries later on, Veccur, Patriarch of Constantinople, declares they hung
there still.221</p>
<p>It was not till 1014 that for the first time the interpolated creed was used at mass with
the sanction of the Pope. In that year Benedict VIII. acceded to the urgent request of Henry
II. of Germany and so the papal authority was forced to yield, and the silver shields have
disappeared from St. Peter’s.</p>
<p>3. Nothing could be clearer than that the theologians of the West never had any idea
of teaching a double source of the Godhead. The doctrine of the Divine Monarchy was always
intended to be preserved, and while in the heat of the controversy sometimes expressions
highly dangerous, or at least clearly inaccurate, may have been used, yet the intention must
be judged from the prevailing teaching of the approved theologians. And what this was is
evident from the definition of the Council of Florence, which, while indeed it was not received
by the Eastern Church, and therefore cannot be accepted as an authoritative exposition of
<note type="footnote">215 Muratorius. Ord. Rom., Tom. I., col. 541.</note>

<pb n="359"/>
its views, yet certainly must be regarded as a true and full expression of the teaching of the
West. “The Greeks asserted that when they say the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father,
they do not use it because they wish to exclude the Son; but because it seemed to them, as
they say, that the Latins assert the Holy Spirit to proceed from the Father and the Son, as
from two principles and by two spirations, and therefore they abstain from saying that the
Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. But the Latins affirm that they have no
intention when they say the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son to deprive
the Father of his prerogative of being the fountain and principle of the entire Godhead, viz.
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost; nor do they deny that the very procession of the Holy
Ghost from the Son, the Son derives from the Father; nor do they teach two principles or
two spirations; but they assert that there is one only principle, one only spiration, as they
have always asserted up to this time.”</p>
<p>4. It is quite possible that when these words were first used there was no knowledge on
the part of those using them that there had been made any addition to the Creed. As I have
already pointed out, the year 589 is the earliest date at which we find the words actually introduced
into the Creed. Now there can be no doubt whatever that the Council of Toledo
of that year had no suspicion that the creed as they had it was not the creed exactly as adopted
at Constantinople. This is capable of the most ample proof.</p>
<p>In the first place they declared, “Whosoever believes that there is any other Catholic
faith and communion, besides that of the Universal Church, that Church which holds and
honours the decrees of the Councils of Nice, Constantinople, I. Ephesus, and Chalcedon,
let him be anathema.” After some further anathemas in the same sense they repeat “the
creed published at the council of Nice,” and next, “The holy faith which the 150 fathers of
the Council of Constantinople explained, consonant with the great Council of Nice.” And
then lastly, “The holy faith which the translators of the council of Chalcedon explained.”
The creed of Constantinople as recited contained the words “and from the Son.” Now the
fathers at Toledo were not ignorant of the decree of Ephesus forbidding the making of
“another faith” (ἑτέραν πίστιν) for they themselves cite it, as follows from the acts of
Chalcedon; “The holy and universal Synod forbids to bring forward any other faith; or to
write or believe or to teach other, or be otherwise minded. But whoso shall dare either to
expound or produce or deliver any other faith to those who wish to be converted etc.” Upon
this Dr. Pusey well remarks,222 “It is, of course, impossible to suppose that they can have
believed any addition to the creed to have been forbidden by the clause, and, accepting it
with its anathema, themselves to have added to the creed of Constantinople.”</p>
<p>But while this is the case it might be that they understood ἑτέραν of the Ephesine decree
to forbid the making of contradictory and new creeds and not explanatory additions to the
<note type="footnote">222 E. B. Pusey. On the clause, “and the Son,” p. 48.</note>

<pb n="360"/>
existing one. Of this interpretation of the decree, which would seem without any doubt to
be the only tenable one, I shall treat in its proper place.</p>
<p>We have however further proof that the Council of Toledo thought they were using the
unaltered creed of Constantinople. In these acts we find they adopted the following; “for
reverence of the most holy faith and for the strengthening of the weak minds of men, the
holy Synod enacts, with the advice of our most pious and most glorious Lord, King Recarede,
that through all the churches of Spain and Gallæcia, the symbol of faith of the council of
Constantinople, i.e. of the 150 bishops, should be recited according to the form of the
Eastern Church, etc.”</p>
<p>This seems to make the matter clear and the next question which arises is, How the
words could have got into the Spanish creed? I venture to suggest a possible explanation.
Epiphanius tells us that in the year 374 “all the orthodox bishops of the whole Catholic
Church together make this address to those who come to baptism, in order that they may
proclaim and say as follows.”223 If this is to be understood literally of course Spain was included.
Now the creed thus taught the catechumens reads as follows at the point about
which our interest centres:</p>
<p>Καὶ εἰς τὸ ἅγιον πνεῦμα πιστεύομεν,…ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἐκπορευόμενον καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Υἱοῦ
λαμβανόμενον καὶ πιστευόμενον, εἰς μίαν καθολικὴν κ.τ.λ. Now it looks to me as if the
text had got corrupted and that there should be a full stop after λαμβανόμενον, and that
πιστευόμενον should be πιστεύομεν. These emendations are not necessary however for
my suggestion although they would make it more perfect, for in that case by the single
omission of the word λαμβανόμενον the Western form is obtained. It will be noticed that
this was some years before the Constantinopolitan Council and therefore nothing would
be more natural than that a scribe accustomed to writing the old baptismal creed and now
given the Constantinopolitan creed, so similar to it, to copy, should have gone on and added
the καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Υἱοῦ, according to habit.</p>
<p>However this is a mere suggestion, I think I have shewn that there is strong reason to
believe that whatever the explanation may be, the Spanish Church was unaware that it had
added to or changed the Constantinopolitan creed.</p>
<p>5. There remains now only the last point, which is the most important of all, but which
does not belong to the subject matter of this volume and which therefore I shall treat with
the greatest brevity. The writings of St. John Damascene are certainly deemed entirely orthodox
by the Easterns and always have been. On the other hand their entire orthodoxy
has never been disputed in the West, but a citation from Damascene is considered by St.
Thomas as conclusive. Under these circumstances it seems hard to resist the conclusion
that the faith of the East and the West, so far as its official setting forth is concerned, is the
<note type="footnote">223 Epiphanius, Ancoratus, cxx.</note>

<pb n="361"/>
same and always has been. And perhaps no better proof of the Western acceptance of the
Eastern doctrine concerning the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit can be found than the
fact that St. John Damascene has been in recent years raised by the pope for his followers
to the rank of a Doctor of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Perhaps I may be allowed to close with two moderate statements of the Western position,
the one by the learned and pious Dr. Pusey and the other by the none less famous Bishop
Pearson.</p>
<p>Dr. Pusey says:</p>
<p>“Since, however, the clause, which found its way into the Creed, was, in the first instance,
admitted, as being supposed to be part of the Constantinopolitan Creed, and, since after it
had been rooted for 200 years, it was not uprooted, for fear of uprooting also or perplexing
the faith of the people, there was no fault either in its first reception or in its subsequent
retention.”</p>
<p>“The Greeks would condemn forefathers of their own, if they were to pronounce the
clause to be heretical. For it would be against the principles of the Church to be in communion
with an heretical body. But from the deposition of Photius, a.d. 886 to at least a.d.
1009, East and West retained their own expression of faith without schism.224”</p>
<p>“a.d. 1077, Theophylact did not object to the West, retaining for itself the confession of
faith contained in the words, but only excepted against the insertion of the words in the
Creed.225”</p>
<p>And Bp. Pearson, explaining Article VIII. of the Creed says: “Now although the addition
of words to the formal Creed without the consent, and against the protestations of the Oriental
Church be not justifiable; yet that which was added is nevertheless a certain truth, and
may be so used in that Creed by them who believe the same to be a truth; so long as they
pretend it not to be a definition of that Council, but an addition or explication inserted, and
condemn not those who, out of a greater respect to such synodical determinations, will admit
of no such insertions, nor speak any other language than the Scriptures and their Fathers
spoke.”</p>

<head>Historical Note on the Lost “Tome” of the Second Council.</head>
<p>We know from the Synodical letter sent by the bishops who assembled at Constantinople
in a.d. 382 (the next year after the Second Ecumenical Council) sent to Pope Damasus and
other Western bishops, that the Second Council set forth a “Tome,” containing a statement
of the doctrinal points at issue. This letter will be found in full at the end of the treatment
of this council. The Council of Chalcedon in its address to the Emperor says: “The bishops
who at Constantinople detected the taint of Apollinarianism, communicated to the Westerns
their decision in the matter.” From this we may reasonably conclude, with Tillemont,226
that the lost Tome treated also of the Apollinarian heresy. It is moreover by no means unlikely
that the Creed as it has come down to us, was the summary at the end of the Tome,
and was followed by the anathemas which now form our Canon I. It also is likely that the
very accurate doctrinal statements contained in the Letter of the Synod of 382 may be taken
almost, if not quite, verbatim from this Tome. It seems perfectly evident that at least one
copy of the Tome was sent to the West but how it got lost is a matter on which at present
we are entirely in the dark.</p>

<head>Letter of the Same Holy Synod to the Most Pious Emperor Theodosius the Great, to Which are Appended the Canons Enacted by Them.</head>
<p>(Found in Labbe, Concilia, Tom. II., 945.)</p>
<p>To the most religious Emperor Theodosius, the Holy Synod of Bishops assembled in
Constantinople out of different Provinces.</p>
<p>We begin our letter to your Piety with thanks to God, who has established the empire
of your Piety for the common peace of the Churches and for the support of the true Faith.
And, after rendering due thanks unto God, as in duty bound we lay before your Piety the
things which have been done in the Holy Synod. When, then, we had assembled in Constantinople,
according to the letter of your Piety, we first of all renewed our unity of heart
each with the other, and then we pronounced some concise definitions, ratifying the Faith
of the Nicene Fathers, and anathematizing the heresies which have sprung up, contrary
thereto. Besides these things, we also framed certain Canons for the better ordering of the
Churches, all which we have subjoined to this our letter. Wherefore we beseech your Piety
that the decree of the Synod may be ratified, to the end that, as you have honoured the
Church by your letter of citation, so you should set your seal to the conclusion of what has
been decreed. May the Lord establish your empire in peace and righteousness, and prolong
it from generation to generation; and may he add unto your earthly power the fruition of
the heavenly kingdom also. May God by the prayers (εὐχαῖς τῶν ἁγίων) of the Saints,227
show favour to the world, that you may be strong and eminent in all good things as an
Emperor most truly pious and beloved of God.</p>
<note type="footnote">227 On the whole subject of the prayers of the Saints see H. R. Percival, The Invocation of Saints. (Longmans.

<head>Introduction on the Number of the Canons.</head>
<p>(Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. II., p. 351.)</p>
<p>The number of canons drawn up by this synod is doubtful. The old Greek codices and
the Greek commentators of the Middle Ages, Zonaras and Balsamon, enumerate seven; the
old Latin translations—viz. the Prisca, those by Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, as well as
the Codex of Luna—only recognize the first four canons of the Greek text, and the fact that
they agree in this point is the more important as they are wholly independent of each other,
and divide and arrange those canons of Constantinople which they do acknowledge quite
differently.</p>
<p>Because, however, in the Prisca the canons of Constantinople are only placed after those
of the fourth General Council, the Ballerini brothers conclude that they were not contained
at all in the oldest Greek collections of canons, and were inserted after the Council of
Chalcedon. But it was at this very Council of Chalcedon that the first three canons of
Constantinople were read out word for word. As however, they were not separately
numbered, but were there read under the general title of Synodicon Synodi Secundæ, Fuchs
concluded they were not originally in the form in which we now possess them, but, without
being divided into numbers, formed a larger and unbroken decree, the contents of which
were divided by later copyists and translators into several different canons. And hence the
very different divisions of these canons in the Prisca, Dionysius, and Isidore may be explained.
The fact, however, that the old Latin translations all agree in only giving the first
four canons of the Greek text, seems to show that the oldest Greek manuscripts, from which
those translations were made, did not contain the fifth, sixth, and seventh, and that these
last did not properly belong to this Synod, but were later additions. To this must be added
that the old Greek Church-historians, in speaking of the affairs of the second General
Council, only mention those points which are contained in the first four canons, and say
nothing of what, according to the fifth, sixth, and seventh canons, had also been decided at
Constantinople. At the very least, the seventh canon cannot have emanated from this
Council, since in the sixth century John Scholasticus did not receive it into his collection,
although he adopted the fifth and sixth. It is also missing in many other collections; and in
treating specially of this canon further on, we shall endeavour to show the time and manner
of its origin. But the fifth and sixth canons probably belong to the Synod of Constantinople
of the following year, as Beveridge, the Ballerini, and others conjectured. The Greek scholiasts,
Zonaras and Balsamon, and later on Tillemont, Beveridge, Van Espen and Herbst, have
given more or less detailed commentaries on all these canons.</p>

<p>The Faith of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers assembled at Nice in Bithynia

Semi-Arians or Pneumatomachi, and that of the Sabellians, and that of the Marcellians, and
that of the Photinians, and that of the Apollinarians.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</p>
<p>Let the Nicene faith stand firm. Anathema to heresy.</p>
<p>There is a difference of reading in the list of the heretics. The reading I have followed
in the text is that given in Beveridge’s Synodicon. The Greek text, however, in Labbe, and
with it agree the version of Hervetus and the text of Hefele, reads: “the Eunomians or
Anomæans, the Arians or Eudoxians, the Semi-Arians or Pneumatomachi, the Sabellians,
Marcellians, Photinians and Apollinarians.” From this Dionysius only varies by substituting
“Macedonians” for “Semi-Arians.” It would seem that this was the correct reading. I,
however, have followed the other as being the more usual.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>By the Eudoxians, whom this canon identifies with the Arians <del>according to his text,
vide supra,</del> is meant that faction who, in contradistinction to the strict Arians or Anomæans
on one side, and the Semi-Arians on the other side, followed the leadership of the Court
Bishop Eudoxius (Bishop of Constantinople under the Emperor Valens), and without being
entirely Anomæan, yet very decidedly inclined to the left of the Arian party—probably
claiming to represent the old and original Arianism. But this canon makes the Semi-Arians

identical with the Pneumatomachians, and so far rightly, that the latter sprang from the
Semi-Arian party, and applied the Arian principle to their doctrine of the Holy Ghost.
Lastly, by the Marcellians are meant those pupils of Marcellus of Ancyra who remained in
the errors formerly propounded by him, while afterwards others, and indeed he himself,
once more acknowledged the truth.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Heresies Condemned in Canon I.</head>
<p>In treating of these heresies I shall invert the order of the canon, and shall speak of the
Macedonian and Apollinarian heresies first, as being most nearly connected with the object
for which the Constantinopolitan Synod was assembled.</p>
<p>The Semi-Arians, Macedonians or Pneumatomachi.</p>
<p>Peace indeed seemed to have been secured by the Nicene decision but there was an
element of discord still extant, and so shortly afterwards as in 359 the double-synod of
Rimini (Ariminum) and Selencia rejected the expressions homousion and homoeusion equally,
and Jerome gave birth to his famous phrase, “the world awoke to find itself Arian.” The
cause of this was the weight attaching to the Semi-Arian party, which counted among its
numbers men of note and holiness, such as St. Cyril of Jerusalem. Of the developments of
this party it seems right that some mention should be made in this place, since it brought
forth the Macedonian heresy.</p>
<p>(Wm. Bright, D.D., St. Leo on the Incarnation, pp. 213 et seqq.)</p>
<p>The Semi-Arian party in the fourth century attempted to steer a middle course between
calling the Son Consubstantial and calling him a creature. Their position, indeed, was untenable,
but several persisted in clinging to it; and it was adopted by Macedonius, who occupied
the see of Constantinople. It was through their adoption of a more reverential language
about the Son than had been used by the old Arians, that what is called the Macedonian
heresy showed itself. Arianism had spoken both of the Son and the Holy Spirit as creatures.
The Macedonians, rising up out of Semi-Arianism, gradually reached the Church’s belief
as to the uncreated majesty of the Son, even if they retained their objection to the homoousion
as a formula. But having, in their previously Semi-Arian position, refused to extend their
own “homoiousion” to the Holy Spirit, they afterwards persisted in regarding him as “external
to the one indivisible Godhead,” Newman’s Arians, p. 226; or as Tillemont says (Mém.
vi., 527), “the denial of the divinity of the Holy Spirit was at last their capital or only error.”
St. Athanasius, while an exile under Constantius for the second time, “heard with pain,” as
he says (Ep. i. ad Serap., 1) that “some who had left the Arians from disgust at their blasphemy
against the Son of God, yet called the Spirit a creature, and one of the ministering spirits,
differing only in degree from the Angels:” and soon afterwards, in 362, the Council of Alexandria
condemned the notion that the Spirit was a creature, as being “no true avoidance
of the detestable Arian heresy.” See “Later Treatises of St. Athanasius,” p. 5. Athanasius
insisted that the Nicene Fathers, although silent on the nature of the Holy Spirit, had by
implication ranked him with the Father and the Son as an object of belief (ad Afros, 11).
After the death of St. Athanasius, the new heresy was rejected on behalf of the West by Pope

<pb n="368"/>
Damasus, who declared the Spirit to be truly and properly from the Father (as the Son from
the Divine substance) and very God, “omnia posse et omnia nosse, et ubique esse,” coequal
and adorable (Mansi, iii., 483). The Illyrian bishops also, in 374, wrote to the bishops of
Asia Minor, affirming the consubstantiality of the Three Divine Persons (Theodoret, H. E.,
iv., 9). St. Basil wrote his De Spiritu Sancto in the same sense (see Swete, Early History of
the Doctrine of the Holy Spirit, pp. 58, 67), and in order to vindicate this truth against the
Pneumatomachi, as the Macedonians were called by the Catholics, the Constantinopolitan
recension of the Nicene Creed added the words, “the Lord and the Life-giver, proceeding
from the Father, with the Father and the Son worshipped and glorified” etc., which had
already formed part of local Creeds in the East.</p>
<p>From the foregoing by Canon Bright, the reader will be able to understand the connexion
between the Semi-Arians and Pneumatomachi, as well as to see how the undestroyed
heretical germs of the Semi-Asian heresy necessitated by their development the condemnation
of a second synod.</p>
<p>The Apollinarians.</p>
<p>(Philip Schaff, in Smith and Wace, Dict. Christ. Biog., s.v. Apollinaris.)</p>
<p>Apollinaris was the first to apply the results of the Nicene controversy to Christology
proper, and to call the attention of the Church to the psychical and pneumatic element in
the humanity of Christ; but in his zeal for the true deity of Christ, and fear of a double personality,
he fell into the error of a partial denial of his true humanity. Adopting the psychological
trichotomy of Plato (σῶμα ψυχὴ, πνεῦμα), for which he quoted 1. Thess. v. 23 and
Gal. v. 17, he attributed to Christ a human body (σῶμα) and a human soul (the ψυχὴ ἄλογος,
the anima animans which man has in common with the animal), but not a rational spirit
(νοῦς, πνεῦμα, ψυχὴ λογικὴ, anima rationalis,) and put in the place of the latter the divine
Logos. In opposition to the idea of a mere connection of the Logos with the man Jesus, he
wished to secure an organic unity of the two, and so a true incarnation; but he sought this
at the expense of the most important constituent of man. He reached only a Θεὸς
σαρκοφόρος as Nestorianism only an ἄνθρωπος θεοφόρος instead of the proper θεάνδρωτος
. He appealed to the fact that the Scripture says, “the Word was made flesh”—not spirit;
“God was manifest in the flesh” etc. To which Gregory Nazianzen justly replied that in these
passages the term σάρξ was used by synecdoche for the whole human nature. In this way
Apollinaris established so close a connection of the Logos with human flesh, that all the divine
attributes were transferred to the human nature, and all the human attributes to the divine,
and the two merged in one nature in Christ. Hence he could speak of a crucifixion of the
Logos, and a worship of his flesh. He made Christ a middle being between God and man,
in whom, as it were, one part divine and two parts human were fused in the unity of a new

<pb n="369"/>
nature. He even ventured to adduce created analogies, such as the mule, midway between
the horse and the ass; the grey colour, a mixture of white and black; and spring, in distinction
from winter and summer. Christ, said he, is neither whole man, nor God, but a mixture
(μίξις) of God and man. On the other hand, he regarded the orthodox view of a union of
full humanity with a full divinity in one person—of two wholes in one whole—as an absurdity.
He called the result of this construction ἀνθρωπόθεος , a sort of monstrosity, which
he put in the same category with the mythological figure of the Minotaur. But the Apollinarian
idea of the union of the Logos with a truncated human nature might be itself more
justly compared with this monster. Starting from the Nicene homoousion as to the Logos,
but denying the completeness of Christ’s humanity, he met Arianism half-way, which likewise
put the divine Logos in the place of the human spirit in Christ. But he strongly asserted his
unchangeableness, while Arians taught his changeableness (τρεπτότης).</p>
<p>The faith of the Church revolted against such a mutilated and stunted humanity of
Christ which necessarily involved also a merely partial redemption. The incarnation is an
assumption of the entire human nature, sin only excluded. The ἐνσάρκωσις is
ἐνανθρώπησις. To be a full and complete Redeemer, Christ must be a perfect man (τέλειος
ἄνθρωπος). The spirit or rational soul is the most important element in man, his crowning
glory, the seat of intelligence and freedom, and needs redemption as well as the soul and
the body; for sin has entered and corrupted all the faculties.</p>
<p>In the sentence immediately preceding the above Dr. Scruff remarks “but the peculiar
Christology of Apollinaris has reappeared from time to time in a modified shape, as isolated
theological opinion.” No doubt Dr. Schaff had in mind the fathers of the so-called
“Kenoticism” of to-day, Gess and Ebrard, who teach, unless they have been misunderstood,
that the incarnate Son had no human intellect or rational soul (νοῦς) but that the divine
personality took its place, by being changed into it. By this last modification, they claim to
escape from the taint of the Apollinarian heresy.229</p>
<note type="footnote">229 The theological views of Gess and Ebrard I know only from the statements of them in writers on the
subject of the Incarnation, especially from those made by the Rev. A. B. Bruce, D D., Professor at Free Church
College, Glasgow, in his work “The Humiliation of Christ.” (Lecture IV.) The following passage (cited by Dr. Bruce) seems to prove his contention so far as Gess is concerned. “Dass eine wahrhaft menschliche Seele in Jesu war, versteht sich für und von selbt: er war ja sonst kein wirklicher Mensch. Aber die Frage ist, ob der in’s
Werden eingegangene Logos selbst diese menschliche Seele, oder ob neben dem in’s Werden eingegangenen
Logos noch eine becondere menschliche Seele in Jesu war?” (Gess. Die Lehre v. d. Person Christi, ii. p. 321.)
Bruce understands Gess to teach that “The only difference between the Logos and a human soul was, that he became human by voluntary kenosis, while an ordinary human soul derives its existence from a creative act.”
(And refers to Gess, ut supra, p. 325 et seqq.) For Ebrard’s view, see his Christliche Dogmatik, ii., p. 40. Ritschl dubbed the whole kenotic theory as “Verschämter Socinianismus.”</note>

<pb n="370"/>
<p>The Eunomians or Anomoeans.</p>
<p>(Bright, Notes on the Canons, Canon I. of I. Const.)</p>
<p>“The Eunomians or Anomoeans.” These were the ultra-Arians, who carried to its legitimate
issue the original Arian denial of the eternity and uncreatedness of the Son, while
they further rejected what Arius had affirmed as to the essential mysteriousness of the Divine
nature (Soc., H. E., iv., 7; comp. Athan., De Synod., 15). Their founder was Aëtius, the most
versatile of theological adventurers (cf. Athan., De Synod., 31; Soc., H. E., ii., 45; and see a
summary of his career in Newman’s Arians, p. 347); but their leader at the time of the
Council was the daring and indefatigable Eunomius (for whose personal characteristics, see
his admirer Philostorgius, x., 6). He, too, had gone through many vicissitudes from his first
employment as the secretary of Aëtius, and his ordination as deacon by Eudoxius; as bishop
of Cyzicus, he had been lured into a disclosure of his true sentiments, and then denounced
as a heretic (Theod., H. E., ii., 29); with Aëtius he had openly separated from Eudoxius as a
disingenuous time-server, and had gone into retirement at Chalcedon (Philostorg., ix., 4).
The distinctive formula of his adherents was the “Anomoion.” The Son, they said, was not
“like to the Father in essence”; even to call him simply “like” was to obscure the fact that he
was simply a creature, and, as such, “unlike” to his Creator. In other words, they thought
the Semi-Arian “homoiousion” little better than the Catholic “homoousion”: the “homoion”
of the more “respectable” Arians represented in their eyes an ignoble reticence; the plain
truth, however it might shock devout prejudice, must be put into words which would bar
all misunderstanding: the Son might be called “God,” but in a sense merely titular, so as to
leave an impassable gulf between him and the uncreated Godhead (see Eunomius’s Exposition
in Valesius’s note on Soc., H. E., v., 10). Compare Basil (Epist., 233, and his work against
Eunomius), and Epiphanius (Hær., 76).</p>
<p>The Arians or Eudoxians.</p>
<p>(Bright. Ut supra.)</p>
<p>“The Arians or Eudoxians.” By these are meant the ordinary Arians of the period, or,
as they may be called, the Acacian party, directed for several years by the essentially worldly
and unconscientious Eudoxius. His real sympathies were with the Anomoeans (see Tillemont,
Mémoires, vi., 423, and compare his profane speech recorded by Socrates, H. E., ii., 43): but,
as a bishop of Constantinople, he felt it necessary to discourage them, and to abide by the
vague formula invented by Acacius of Cæsarea, which described the Son as “like to the
Father,” without saying whether this likeness was supposed to be more than moral (cf.
Newman, Arians, p. 317), so that the practical effect of this “homoion” was to prepare the

<pb n="371"/>
way for that very Anomoeanism which its maintainers were ready for political purposes to
disown.</p>
<p>The Sabellians.</p>
<p>(Bright. Ut supra.)</p>
<p>“The Sabellians,” whose theory is traceable to Noetus and Praxeas in the latter part of
the second century: they regarded the Son and the Holy Spirit as aspects and modes of, or
as emanations from, the One Person of the Father (see Newman’s Arians, pp. 120 et seqq.).
Such a view tended directly to dissolve Christian belief in the Trinity and in the Incarnation
(Vide Wilberforce, Incarnation, pp. 112, 197). Hence the gentle Dionysius of Alexandria
characterised it in severe terms as involving “blasphemy, unbelief, and irreverence, towards
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit” (Euseb., H. E., vii.. 6). Hence the deep repugnance
which it excited, and the facility with which the imputation of “Sabellianizing” could be
utilised by the Arians against maintainers of the Consubstantiality (Hilary, De Trinit., iv.,
4; De Synod., 68; Fragm., 11; Basil, Epist., 189, 2). No organized Sabellian sect was in exist
ence at the date of this anathema: but Sabellian ideas were “in the air,” and St. Basil could
speak of a revival of this old misbelief (Epist., 126). We find it again asserted by Chilperic
I., King of Neustria, in the latter part of the sixth century (Greg. Turon., Hist. Fr., v., 45).</p>
<p>The Marcellians.</p>
<p>(Bright. Ut supra.)</p>
<p>“The Marcellians,” called after Marcellus bishop of Ancyra, who was persistently denounced
not only by the Arianizers, but by St. Basil, and for a time, at least, suspected by
St. Athanasius (Vide Epiphan., Hær., 72, 4) as one who held notions akin to Sabellianism,
and fatal to a true belief in the Divine Sonship and the Incarnation. The theory ascribed to
him was that the Logos was an impersonal Divine power, immanent from eternity in God,
but issuing from him in the act of creation, and entering at last into relations with the human
person of Jesus, who thus became God’s Son. But this expansion of the original divine unity
would be followed by a “contraction,” when the Logos would retire from Jesus, and God
would again be all in all. Some nine years before the council, Marcellus, then in extreme
old age, had sent his deacon Eugenius to St. Athanasius, with a written confession of faith,
quite orthodox as to the eternity of the Trinity, and the identity of the Logos with a pre-existing
and personal Son, although not verbally explicit as to the permanence of Christ’s
“kingdom,”—the point insisted on in one of the Epiphanian-Constantinopolitan additions
to the Creed (Montfaucon, Collect. Nov., ii., 1). The question whether Marcellus was personally
heterodox—i.e. whether the extracts from his treatise, made by his adversary Eusebius
of Cæsarea, give a fair account of his real views—has been answered unfavourably by

<pb n="372"/>
some writers, as Newman (Athanasian Treatises, ii., 200, ed. 2), and Döllinger (Hippolytus
and Callistus, p. 217, E. T. p. 201), while others, like Neale, think that “charity and truth”
suggest his “acquittal” (Hist. Patr. Antioch., p. 106). Montfaucon thinks that his written
statements might be favourably interpreted, but that his oral statements must have given
ground for suspicion.</p>
<p>The Photinians.</p>
<p>(Bright. Ut supra. )</p>
<p>“The Photinians,” or followers of Marcellus’s disciple Photinus, bishop of Sirmium, the
ready-witted and pertinacious disputant whom four successive synods condemned before
he could be got rid of, by State power, in a.d. 351. (See St. Athanasius’s Historical Writings,
Introd. p. lxxxix.) In his representation of the “Marcellian” theology, he laid special stress
on its Christological position—that Jesus, on whom the Logos rested with exceptional fulness,
was a mere man. See Athanasius, De Synodis, 26, 27, for two creeds in which Photinianism
is censured; also Soc. H. E. ii., 18, 29, 30; vii., 32. There is an obvious affinity between it and
the “Samosatene” or Paulionist theory.</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>The bishops are not to go beyond their dioceses to churches lying outside of their bounds,
nor bring confusion on the churches; but let the Bishop of Alexandria, according to the
canons, alone administer the affairs of Egypt; and let the bishops of the East manage the
East alone, the privileges of the Church in Antioch, which are mentioned in the canons of
Nice, being preserved; and let the bishops of the Asian Diocese administer the Asian affairs
only; and the Pontic bishops only Pontic matters; and the Thracian bishops only Thracian
affairs. And let not bishops go beyond their dioceses for ordination or any other ecclesiastical
ministrations, unless they be invited. And the aforesaid canon concerning dioceses
being observed, it is evident that the synod of every province will administer the affairs of
that particular province as was decreed at Nice. But the Churches of God in heathen nations
must be governed according to the custom which has prevailed from the times of the Fathers.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</p>
<p>No traveller shall introduce confusion into the Churches either by ordaining or by enthroning.
Nevertheless in Churches which are among the heathen the tradition of the Fathers shall
be preserved.</p>
<p>In the above Ancient Epitome it will be noticed that not only is ordination mentioned
but also the “inthronization” of bishops. Few ceremonies are of greater antiquity in the
Christian Church than the solemn placing of the newly chosen bishop in the episcopal chair
of his diocese. It is mentioned in the Apostolical Constitutions, and in the Greek Pontificals.
Also in the Arabic version of the Nicene Canons. (No. lxxi.). A sermon was usually delivered
by the newly consecrated bishop, called the “sermo enthronisticus.” He also sent to neighbouring
bishops συλλαβαὶ ἐνθρονιστικαὶ, and the fees the new bishops paid were called τὰ
ἐνθρονιστικὰ.</p>
<p>Valesius.</p>
<p>(Note on Socrates, H. E., v., 8).</p>
<p>This rule seems to have been made chiefly on account of Meletius, Bishop of Antioch,
Gregory Nazianzen, and Peter of Alexandria. For Meletius leaving the Eastern diocese had
come to Constantinople to ordain Gregory bishop there. And Gregory having abandoned
the bishoprick of Sasima, which was in the Pontic diocese, had removed to Constantinople.
While Peter of Alexandria had sent to Constantinople seven Egyptian bishops to ordain

<pb n="374"/>
Maximus the Cynic. For the purpose therefore of repressing these <del>disorders</del>, the fathers
of the Synod of Constantinople made this canon.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>Take notice from the present canon that formerly all the Metropolitans of provinces
were themselves the heads of their own provinces, and were ordained by their own synods.
But all this was changed by Canon xxviij of the Synod of Chalcedon, which directs that the
Metropolitans of the dioceses of Pontus, Asia, and Thrace, and certain others which are
mentioned in this Canon should be ordained by the Patriarch of Constantinople and should
be subject to him. But if you find other churches which are autocephalous as the Church
of Bulgaria, of Cyprus, of Iberia, you need not be astonished. For the Emperor Justinian
gave this honour to the Archbishop of Bulgaria.…The third Synod gave this honour to the
Archbishop of Cyprus, and by the law of the same synod (Canon viii.), and by the Sixth
Synod in its xxxixth Canon, the judgment of the Synod of Antioch is annulled and this
honour granted to the bishop of Iberia.</p>
<p>Tillemont.</p>
<p>(Mém. ix., 489).</p>
<p>The Council seems likewise to reject, whether designedly or inadvertently, what had
been ordained by the Council of Sardica in favour of Rome. But as assuredly it did not affect
to prevent either Ecumenical Councils, or even general Councils of the East, from judging
of matters brought before them, so I do not know if one may conclude absolutely that they
intended to forbid appeals to Rome. It regulates proceedings between Dioceses, but not
what might concern superior tribunals.</p>
<p>Fleury.</p>
<p>(Hist. Eccl. in loc.).</p>
<p>This Canon, which gives to the councils of particular places full authority in Ecclesiastical
matters, seems to take away the power of appealing to the Pope granted by the Council
of Sardica, and to restore the ancient right.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>An exception to the rule against interference in other patriarchates was made with regard
to those Churches newly founded amongst barbarous nations (not belonging to the Roman
Empire), as these were of course obliged to receive their first bishops from strange patriarchates,
and remained afterwards too few in number to form patriarchates of their own and

<pb n="375"/>
were therefore governed as belonging to other patriarchates, as, for instance, Abyssinia by
the patriarchate of Alexandria.</p>

<head>Canon III.</head>
<p>The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the
Bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>The bishop of Constantinople is to be honoured next after the bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that the change effected by this canon did not affect Rome
directly in any way, but did seriously affect Alexandria and Antioch, which till then had
ranked next after the see of Rome. When the pope refused to acknowledge the authority of
this canon, he was in reality defending the principle laid down in the canon of Nice, that in
such matters the ancient customs should continue. Even the last clause, it would seem,
could give no offence to the most sensitive on the papal claims, for it implies a wonderful
power in the rank of Old Rome, if a see is to rank next to it because it happens to be “New
Rome.” Of course these remarks only refer to the wording of the canon which is carefully
guarded; the intention doubtless was to exalt the see of Constantinople, the chief see of the
East, to a position of as near equality as possible with the chief see of the West.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>In this place the Council takes action concerning Constantinople, to which it decrees
the prerogative of honour, the priority, and the glory after the Bishop of Rome as being New
Rome and the Queen of cities. Some indeed wish to understand the preposition μετὰ here
of time and not of inferiority of grade. And they strive to confirm this interpretation by a
consideration of the XXVIII canon of Chalcedon, urging that if Constantinople is to enjoy
equal honours, the preposition “after” cannot signify subjection. But on the other hand the
hundred and thirtieth novel of Justinian,230 Book V of the Imperial Constitutions, title
three, understands the canon otherwise. For, it says, “we decree that the most holy Pope of
Old Rome, according to the decrees of the holy synods is the first of all priests, and that the
most blessed bishop of Constantinople and of New Rome, should have the second place
after the Apostolic Throne of the Elder Rome, and should be superior in honour to all others.”
From this therefore it is abundantly evident that “after” denotes subjection
(ὑποβιβασμὸν) and diminution. And otherwise it would be impossible to guard this
equality of honour in each see. For in reciting their names, or assigning them seats when
<note type="footnote">230 The reader will notice that this is not even an approximately contemporaneous interpretation, but more
than a century and a half later, after Leo I. had done so much to establish the power of his see.</note>

<pb n="377"/>
they are to sit together, or arranging the order of their signatures to documents, one must
come before the other. Whoever therefore shall explain this particle μετὰ as only referring
to time, and does not admit that it signifies an inferior grade of dignity, does violence to the
passage and draws from it a meaning neither true nor good. Moreover in Canon xxxvj of
the Council in Trullo, μετὰ manifestly denotes subjection, assigning to Constantinople the
second place after the throne of Old Rome; and then adds, after this Alexandria, then Antioch,
and last of all shall be placed Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>If we enquire the reason why this Council tried to change the order of rank of the great
Sees, which had been established in the sixth Nicene canon, we must first take into consideration
that, since the elevation of Constantinople to the Imperial residence, as New Rome,
the bishops as well as the Emperors naturally wished to see the new imperial residence, New
Rome, placed immediately after Old Rome in ecclesiastical rank also; the rather, as with the
Greeks it was the rule for the ecclesiastical rank of a See to follow the civil rank of the city.
The Synod of Antioch in 341, in its ninth canon, had plainly declared this, and subsequently
the fourth General Council, in its seventeenth canon, spoke in the same sense. But how
these principles were protested against on the side of Rome, we shall see further on in the
history of the fourth General Council. For the present, it may suffice to add that the aversion
to Alexandria which, by favouring Maximus, had exercised such a disturbing influence on
Church affairs in Constantinople, may well have helped to effect the elevation of the See of
Constantinople over that of Alexandria. Moreover, for many centuries Rome did not recog-
nize this change of the old ecclesiastical order. In the sixteenth session of the fourth General
Council, the Papal Legate, Lucentius, expressly declared this. In like manner the Popes Leo
the Great and Gregory the Great pronounced against it; and though even Gratian adopted
this canon in his collection the Roman critics added the following note: Canon hic ex iis
est, quos Apostolica Romana Sedes a principio et longo post tempore non recepit. It was only
when, after the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins, a Latin patriarchate was founded
there in 1204, that Pope Innocent III, and the twelfth General Council, in 1215, allowed this
patriarch the first rank after the Roman; and the same recognition was expressly awarded
to the Greek Patriarch at the Florentine Union in 1439.</p>

<p>Remarkable enough it is that when, in the Council of Chalcedon, appeal was made to
this third Canon, the Pope St. Leo declared that it had never been notified to Rome. As in

the mean time it had taken effect throughout the whole East, as in this very council Nectarius,
as soon as he is elected, presides instead of Timothy of Alexandria, it puts in a strong point
of view the real self-government of the Eastern Church at this time; for the giving the Bishop
of Constantinople precedence over Alexandria and Antioch was a proceeding which affected
the whole Church, and so far altered its original order—one in which certainly the West
might claim to have a voice. Tillemont goes on: “It would be very difficult to justify St. Leo,
if he meant that the Roman Church had never known that the Bishop of Constantinople
took the second place in the Church, and the first in the East, since his legates, whose conduct
he entirely approves, had just themselves authorized it as a thing beyond dispute, and Eusebius
of Dorylæum maintained that St. Leo himself had proved it.” The simple fact is, that,
exceedingly unwilling as the Bishops of Rome were to sanction it, from this time, 381, to
say the least, the Bishop of Constantinople appears uniformly as first bishop of the East.</p>
<p>Cardinal Baronius in his Annals (a.d. 381, n. 35, 36) has disputed the genuineness of
this Canon! As already mentioned it is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Decretum, Pars
I., Dist. XXII, c. iij. The note added to this in Gratian reads as follows:</p>
<p>Note in Gratian’s “Decretum.”</p>
<p>This canon is of the number of those which the Apostolic See of Rome did not at first
nor for long years afterwards receive. This is evident from Epistle LI. (or LIII.) of Pope Leo
I. to Anatolius of Constantinople and from several other of his letters. The same thing also
is shewn by two letters of Leo IX.’s, the one against the presumptuous acts of Michael and
Leo (cap. 28) and the other addressed to the same Michael. But still more clearly is this seen
from the letter of Blessed Gregory (xxxj., lib. VI.) to Eulogius of Alexandria and Anastasius
of Antioch, and from the letter of Nicholas I. to the Emperor Michel which begins “Proposueramus.”
However, the bishops of Constantinople, sustained by the authority of the
Emperors, usurped to themselves the second place among the patriarchs, and this at length
was granted to them for the sake of peace and tranquillity, as Pope Innocent III. declares
(in cap. antiqua de privileg.).232</p>
<p>This canon Dionysius Exiguus appends to Canon 2, and dropping 5, 6, and 7 he has but
three canons of this Synod.</p>
<note type="footnote">232 For some reason this canon does not seem to be any more acceptable to modern champions of the Papacy
than it was to the Church of Rome fifteen hundred years ago. I give as a sample of this the following from a recent
Roman Catholic writer: “The decree which goes by the name of the Third Canon of Constantinople was the
germ of the successful mendacity of the arch-rebel Photius.” (Rivington. The Prim. Ch., p. 263). The phraseology
seems to suggest warm discontent at the canon.</note>

<head>Canon IV.</head>
<p>Concerning Maximus the Cynic and the disorder which has happened in Constantinople
on his account, it is decreed that Maximus never was and is not now a Bishop; that those
who have been ordained by him are in no order whatever of the clergy; since all which has
been done concerning him or by him, is declared to be invalid.</p>

by him on the clergy list shall be held as profane.</p>
<p>Edmund Venables.</p>
<p>(Smith and Wace, Dict. Christ. Biog.)</p>
<p>Maximus the Cynic; the intrusive bishop of Constantinople, a.d. 380. Ecclesiastical
history hardly presents a more extraordinary career than that of this man, who, after a most
disreputable youth, more than once brought to justice for his misdeeds, and bearing the
scars of his punishments, by sheer impudence, clever flattery, and adroit management of
opportunities, contrived to gain the confidence successively of no less men than Peter of
Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzen, and Ambrose, and to install himself in one of the first sees
of the church, from which he was with difficulty dislodged by a decree of an ecumenical
council. His history also illustrates the jealousy felt by the churches of Alexandria and Rome
towards their young and vigorous rival for patriarchal honours, the church of Constantinople;
as well as their claim to interfere with her government, and to impose prelates upon her
according to their pleasure. Alexandria, as the chief see of the Eastern world, from the first
asserted a jurisdiction which she has never formally relinquished over the see of Constantinople,
more particularly in a vacancy in the episcopate (Neale, Patr. of Alexandria, i.,
206). The conduct of Peter, the successor of Athanasius, first in instituting Gregory Nazianzen
bishop of Constantinople by his letters and sending a formal recognition of his appointment
and then in substituting Maximus, as has been remarked by Milman (History of
Christianity, iii., 115, note) and Ullman (Greg. Naz., p. 203 <del>Cox’s translation</del>), furnish
unmistakable indications of the desire to erect an Oriental papacy, by establishing the
primacy of Alexandria over Constantinople and so over the East, which was still further illustrated
a few years later by the high-handed behaviour of Theophilus towards Chrysostom.
Maximus was a native of Alexandria of low parentage. He boasted that his family had
produced martyrs. He got instructed in the rudiments of the Christian faith and received

<pb n="380"/>
baptism, but strangely enough sought to combine the Christian profession with Cynic
philosophy.</p>
<p>When he presented himself at the Eastern capital he wore the white robe of a Cynic,
and carried a philosopher’s staff, his head being laden with a huge crop of crisp curling hair,
dyed a golden yellow, and swinging over his shoulders in long ringlets. He represented
himself as a confessor for the Nicene faith, and his banishment to the Oasis as a suffering
for the truth (Orat. xxiii., p. 419). Before long he completely gained the ear and heart of
Gregory, who admitted him to the closest companionship. Maximus proclaimed the most
unbounded admiration for Gregory’s discourses, which he praised in private, and, according
to the custom of the age, applauded in public. His zeal against heretics was most fierce, and
his denunciation of them uncompromising. The simple-hearted Gregory became the
complete dupe of Maximus.</p>
<p>All this time Maximus was secretly maturing a plot for ousting his unsuspicious patron
from his throne. He gained the ear and the confidence of Peter of Alexandria, and induced
him to favour his ambitious views. Gregory, he asserted, had never been formally enthroned
bishop of Constantinople; his translation thither was a violation of the canons of the church;
rustic in manners, he had proved himself quite unfitted for the place. Constantinople was
getting weary of him. It was time the patriarch of the Eastern world should exercise his
prerogative and give New Rome a more suitable bishop. The old man was imposed on as
Gregory had been, and lent himself to Maximus’s projects. Maximus found a ready tool in
a presbyter of Constantinople, envious of Gregory’s talents and popularity (de Vit., p. 13).
Others were gained by bribes. Seven unscrupulous sailor fellows were despatched from
Alexandria to mix with the people, and watch for a favourable opportunity for carrying out
the plot. When all was ripe they were followed by a bevy of bishops, with secret instructions
from the patriarch to consecrate Maximus.</p>
<p>The conspirators chose the night for the accomplishment of their enterprise. Gregory
they knew was confined by illness. They forced their way into the cathedral, and commenced
the rite of ordination. By the time they had set the Cynic on the archiepiscopal throne, and
had just begun shearing away his long curls, they were surprised by the dawn. The news
quickly spread, and everybody rushed to the church. The magistrates appeared on the scene
with their officers; Maximus and his consecrators were driven from the sacred precincts,
and in the house or shop of a flute-player the tonsure was completed. Maximus repaired
to Thessalonica to lay his cause before Theodosius. He met with a cold reception from the
emperor, who committed the matter to Ascholius, the much respected bishop of that city,
charging him to refer it to pope Damasus. We have two letters of Damasus’s on this subject.

<pb n="381"/>
In the first, addressed to Ascholius and the Macedonian bishops, he vehemently condemns
the “ardor animi et foeda presumptio” which had led certain persons coming from Egypt,
in violation of the rule of ecclesiastical discipline, to have proposed to consecrate a restless
man, an alien from the Christian profession, not worthy to be called a Christian, who wore
an idolatrous garb (“habitus idoli”) and the long hair which St. Paul said was a shame to a
man, and remarks on the fact that being expelled from the church they were compelled to
complete the ordination “intra parietes alienos.” In the second letter addressed to Ascholius
individually (Ep. vi.) he repeats his condemnation of the ordination of the long-haired
Maximus (“comatum”) and asks him to take special care that a Catholic bishop may be ordained
(Migne, Patrolog., xiii., pp. 366–369; Ep. 5; 5, 6).</p>
<p>Maximus returned to Alexandria, and demanded that Peter should assist him in re-establishing
himself at Constantinople. But Peter had discovered the man’s true character,
and received him as coldly as Theodosius had done. Determined to carry his point he
presented himself to the patriarch at the head of a disorderly mob, with the threat that if he
did not help him to gain the throne of Constantinople he would have that of Alexandria.
Peter appealed to the prefect, by whom Maximus was driven out of Egypt. The death of
Peter and the accession of Timotheus are placed Feb. 14, 380. The events described must
therefore have occurred in 379. When the second ecumenical council met at Constantinople
in 381, the question of Maximus’s claim to the see of Constantinople came up for consideration.
His pretensions were unanimously rejected.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>(Notes on the Canons, in loc.)</p>
<p>Maximus, however, having been expelled from Egypt, made his way into Northern Italy,
presented to Gratian at Milan a large work which he had written against the Arians (as to
which Gregory sarcastically remarks—“Saul a prophet, Maximus an author!” Carm. adv.
Mar., 21), and deceived St. Ambrose and his suffragans by showing the record of his consecration,
with letters which Peter had once written in his behalf. To these prelates of the “Italic
diocese” the appeal of Maximus seemed like the appeal of Athanasius, and more recently
of Peter himself, to the sympathy of the church of Rome; and they requested Theodosius to
let the case be heard before a really General Council (Mansi, iii. 631). Nothing further came
of it; perhaps, says Tillemont, those who thus wrote in favour of Maximus “reconnurent
bientôt quel il était” (ix., 502): so that when a Council did meet at Rome towards the end
of 382, no steps were taken in his behalf.</p>

<head>Canon V.</head>
<p>(Probably adopted at a Council held in Constantinople the next year, 382. Vide. Introduction
on the number of the Canons.)</p>
<p>In regard to the tome of the Western [Bishops], we receive those in Antioch also who
confess the unity of the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</p>
<p>The Tome of the Westerns which recognizes the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as
consubstantial is highly acceptable.</p>
<p>Beveridge and Van Espen translate this canon differently, thus, “With regard to the
tome of the Westerns, we agree with those in Antioch [i.e. the Synod of 378] who (accepted
it and) acknowledged the unity of the Godhead of the Father etc.” In opposition to this
translation Hefele urges that ἀποδέχεσθαι in ecclesiastical language usually refers to receiving
persons and recognizing them, not opinions or doctrines.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>This canon probably does not belong to the second General Council, but to the Synod
held in the following year at Constantinople consisting of nearly the same bishops.</p>
<p>It is certain that by the “Tome of the Westerns” a dogmatic work of the Western bishops
is to be understood, and the only question is which Tome of the Westerns is here meant.
Several—for instance, the Greek commentators, Balsamon and Zonaras, and the spokesman
of the Latins at the Synod of Florence in 1439 (Archbishop Andrew of Rhodes)—understood
by it the decrees of the Synod of Sardica; but it seems to me that this canon undoubtedly
indicates that the Tome of the Westerns also mentioned the condition of the Antiochian
Church, and the division into two parties of the orthodox of that place—the Meletian schism.
Now, as this was not mentioned, nay, could not have been, at the Synod of Sardica—for this
schism at Antioch only broke out seventeen years later—some other document of the Latins
must certainly be meant. But we know that Pope Damasus, and the synod assembled by
him in 369, addressed a Tome to the Orientals, of which fragments are still preserved, and
that nine years later, in 379, a great synod at Antioch of one hundred and forty-six orthodox
Oriental bishops, under Meletius, accepted and signed this Tome, and at the same time
sought to put a stop to the Meletian schism. Soon afterwards, in 380, Pope Damasus and
his fourth Roman Synod again sent a treatise on the faith, of which we still possess a portion,
containing anathemas, to the Orientals, especially to Bishop Paul of Antioch, head of the

<pb n="383"/>
Eustathians of that city. Under these circumstances, we are justified in referring the expression
“the tome of the Westerns” either to the Roman treatise of 369 or to that of 380, and I
am disposed to give the preference to the former, for the following reasons:—</p>
<p>(1.) As has been already observed, this canon belongs to the Synod held at Constantinople
in 382.</p>
<p>(2.) We still possess in Theodoret a Synodal Letter to the Latins from this later Synod.</p>
<p>(3.) The canon in question, as proceeding from the same source, is, of course to a certain
extent, connected with this letter.</p>
<p>(4.) In this Synodal Letter, the Eastern bishops, in order to convince the Latins of their
orthodoxy, appeal to two documents, the one a “tome” of an Antiochian Synod, and the
other a “tome” of the Ecumenical Council held at Constantinople in 381.</p>
<p>(5.) By the Antiochian Synod here mentioned, I understand the great synod of 378,
and, as a necessary consequence, believe the “tome” there produced to be none other than
the Roman Tome of 369, which was then accepted at Antioch.</p>
<p>(6.) It is quite certain that the Synod of Antioch sent a copy of this Tome, with the declaration
of its acceptance and the signatures of the members, back to Rome, as a supplement
to its Synodal Letter; and hence Lucas Holstenius was still able to find fragments of it in
Rome.</p>
<p>(7.) The Synod of Constantinople of 382 might well call this Tome, sent back to Rome
with the acceptance and signatures of the Easterns, a “Tome established at Antioch,” although
it was really drawn up at Rome.</p>
<p>(8.) If, however, the Synod of Constantinople in its Synodal Letter speaks of this Tome,
we are justified in supposing that the one mentioned in its canon is the same.</p>
<p>(9.) That which still remains of the Roman Tome of 369, treats expressly of the oneness
of the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and such were the contents of
the Tome according to this canon.</p>
<p>(10.) It is true that the fragments still preserved of this Tome contain no passage directly
referring to the Antiochian schism; but, in the first place, very little remains of it, and there
is the more reason to suppose that the Meletian schism was spoken of in the portion which
has been lost, as it was the same Antiochian Synod that accepted the Tome which urged the
putting an end to that schism. It is still more to the purpose that the Italian bishops, in their
letter to the Easterns in 381, expressly say that they had already long before (dudum) written
to the Orientals in order to put an end to the division between the orthodox at Antioch. By
this “dudum” I conclude that they refer to the Roman Tome of 369; and if the Westerns in
their letter to the Easterns in 381 pointed to this Tome, it was natural that the Synod of
Constantinople of 382 should also have referred to it, for it was that very letter of the Latins
which occasioned and called the synod into being.</p>

<pb n="384"/>
<p>Lastly, for the full understanding of this canon, it is necessary to observe that the Latins,
in their letter just mentioned of 381, say that “they had already in their earlier missive (i.e.
as we suppose, in the Tome of 369) spoken to the effect that both parties at Antioch, one as
much as the other, were orthodox.” Agreeing with this remark of the Westerns, repeated
in their letter of 381, the Easterns in this canon say, “We also recognise all Antiochians as
orthodox who acknowledge the oneness of the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="385"/>
<head>Canon VI.</head>
<p>(Probably adopted at a Council held in Constantinople the next year, 382. Vide Introduction
on the number of Canons.)</p>
<p>Forasmuch as many wishing to confuse and overturn ecclesiastical order, do contentiously
and slanderously fabricate charges against the orthodox bishops who have the administration
of the Churches, intending nothing else than to stain the reputation of the
priests and raise up disturbances amongst the peaceful laity; therefore it seemed right to the
Holy Synod of Bishops assembled together in Constantinople, not to admit accusers without
examination; and neither to allow all persons whatsoever to bring accusations against the
rulers of the Church, nor, on the other hand, to exclude all. If then, any one shall bring a
private complaint against the Bishop, that is, one relating to his own affairs, as, for example,
that he has been defrauded, or otherwise unjustly treated by him, in such accusations no
examination shall be made, either of the person or of the religion of the accuser; for it is by
all means necessary that the conscience of the Bishop should be free, and that he who says
he has been wronged should meet with righteous judgment, of whatever religion he may
be. But if the charge alleged against the Bishop be that of some ecclesiastical offence, then
it is necessary to examine carefully the persons of the accusers, so that, in the first place,
heretics may not be suffered to bring accusations touching ecclesiastical matters against
orthodox bishops. And by heretics we mean both those who were aforetime cast out and
those whom we ourselves have since anathematized, and also those professing to hold the
true faith who have separated from our canonical bishops, and set up conventicles in opposition
<del>to them</del>. Moreover, if there be any who have been condemned for faults and cast
out of the Church, or excommunicated, whether of the clergy or the laity, neither shall it be
lawful for these to bring an accusation against the bishop, until they have cleared away the
charge against themselves. In like manner, persons who are under previous accusations are
not to be permitted to bring charges against a bishop or any other clergyman, until they
shall have proved their own innocence of the accusation brought against them. But if any,
being neither heretics, nor excommunicate, nor condemned, nor under previous accusation
for alleged faults, should declare that they have any ecclesiastical charge against the bishop,
the Holy Synod bids them first lay their charges before all the Bishops of the Province, and
before them prove the accusations, whatsoever they may be, which they have brought against
the bishop. And if the comprovincials should be unable rightly to settle the charges brought
against the bishop, then the parties must betake themselves to a greater synod of the bishops
of that diocese called together for this purpose; and they shall not produce their allegations
before they have promised in writing to undergo an equal penalty to be exacted from
themselves, if, in the course of the examination, they shall be proved to have slandered the
accused bishop. And if anyone, despising what has been decreed concerning these things,

<pb n="386"/>
shall presume to annoy the ears of the Emperor, or the courts of temporal judges, or, to the
dishonour of all the Bishops of his Province, shall trouble an Ecumenical Synod, such an
one shall by no means be admitted as an accuser; forasmuch as he has cast contempt upon
the Canons, and brought reproach upon the order of the Church.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>Even one that is of ill repute, if he have suffered any injury, let him bring a charge against
the bishop. If however it be a crime of ecclesiastical matters let him not speak. Nor shall another
condemned before, speak. Let not one excommunicated, or cast forth, or charged with
any crimes speak, until he is cleared of them. But those who should bring the charge are the
orthodox, who are communicants, uncondemned, unaccused. Let the case be heard by the
provincials. If however they are not able to decide the case, let them have recourse to a
greater synod and let them not be heard, without a written declaration of liability to the same
sufferings <del>i.e. of their readiness to be tried by the lex talionis.</del> But should anyone contrary
to the provisions appeal to the Emperor and trouble him, let such be cast forth.</p>
<p>The phrase “who have the administration of the Churches,” Hatch in his Bampton
Lectures (Lect. I., p. 41) erroneously supposes to refer only to the administration of the
Church’s alms. But this, as Dr. Bright well points out (“Notes on the Canons,” in loc.) cannot
be the meaning of οἰκοναμεῖν when used absolutely as in this canon. He says, “When a
merely ‘economic’ function is intended, the context shows it, as in Chalcedon, Canon xxvj.”
He also points out that in Canon ij., and in Eusebius (H. E. iv., 4), and when St. Basil wishes
his brother to οἰκονομεῖν a church suited to his temperament (Epist. xcviij., 2) the meaning
of the word is evidently spiritual stewardship.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>By “those who were cast out of the Church” are to be understood those who were altogether
cut off from the Church; but by those who were “excommunicated” the holy fathers
intend all those, whether clerics or laymen, who are deprived of communion for a set time.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>It is evident from the context of this canon that “Diocese” here does not signify the
district or territory assigned to any one bishop, as we to-day use the word; but for a district,
which not only contained many episcopal districts, as today do ecclesiastical provinces, but
which contained also many provinces, and this was the meaning of the word at the time of
this Council’s session.</p>

<pb n="387"/>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>We call Adrianople, for example, or Philopopolis with the bishops of each a “Province,”
but the whole of Thrace or Macedonia we call a “Diocese.” When these crimes were brought
forward to be corrected, for the judging of which the provincial bishops were by no means
sufficient, then the Canon orders the bishops of the diocese to assemble, and determine the
charges preferred against the bishop.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Both the Canon and the Civil Law require the accusers to submit themselves to the law
of retaliation (lex talionis). Vide Gratian, Pt. II., Causa II., Quæst. III., 2 and 3, where we
read from the decree of Pope Hadrian; “Whoever shall not prove what he advances, shall
himself suffer the penalty due the crime he charged.” And under the name of Damasus,
“The calumniator, if he fail in proving his accusation, shall receive his tale.” The Civil Law
is in L. x., Cod. de Calumniatoribus, and reads, “Whoso charges a crime, shall not have licence
to lie with impunity, since justice requires that calumniators shall endure the punishment
due the crime which they failed to prove.”</p>
<p>The Council wishes that all accusations of bishops for ecclesiastical offences shall be
kept out of the secular courts, and shall be heard by synods of bishops, in the manner and
form here prescribed, which is in accordance with the Constitution which under the names
of Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian, the Emperors, is referred to in law xxiij. of the Code
of Theodosius, De Episcopis et Clericis.</p>
<p>Whatever may be said of the meeting of bishops at which this canon was enacted, this
is clear, no mention was made of the Roman Pontiff, nor of the Council of Sardica, as Fleury
notes in his Histoire Ecclesiastique, Lib. xviij., n. 8. From this it is evident either that at that
time the Orientals did not admit, especially for bishops, appeals to the Roman Pontiff; nor
did they accept the authority of the Synod of Sardica, in so far as it permitted that the sentence
given in a provincial synod, should be reopened by the neighbouring bishops together with
the bishops of the province, and if it seemed good, that the cause might be referred to Rome.</p>

<head>Warning to the Reader Touching Canon VII.</head>
<p>(Beveridge, Synodicon, Tom. II., in loc.)</p>
<p>This canon, I confess, is contained in all the editions of the Commentaries of Balsamon
and Zonaras. It is cited also by Photius in Nomocanon, Tit. xii. ch. xiv., besides it is extant
in a contracted form in the Epitome of Alexius Aristenus. But it is wanting in all the Latin
versions of the Canons, in the ancient translations of Dionys. Exig., Isidore Mercator, etc.;
also in the Epitome of Sym. Logothet., and the Arabic paraphrase of Josephus Ægyp., and
what is particularly to be observed, in the collection and nomocanon of John of Antioch;
and this not through want of attention on his part, as is clear from this namely, that in the
order of the Canons as given by him he attributes six Canons only to this second General
Council, saying “<gap reason="omitted"/>of the Fathers who assembled at Constantinople, by whom six Canons
were set forth,” so that it is clear the present was not reckoned among the canons of this
council in those days. Nay, the whole composition of this canon clearly indicates that it is
to be ascribed, neither to this present council, nor to any other (unless perhaps to that of
Trullo, of which we shall speak afterwards). For nothing is appointed in it, nothing confirmed,
but a certain ancient custom of receiving converted heretics, is here merely recited.</p>
<p>(Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. II., p. 368.)</p>
<p>As we possess a letter from the Church at Constantinople in the middle of the fifth
century to Bishop Martyrius of Antioch, in which the same subject is referred to in a precisely
similar way, Beveridge is probably right in conjecturing that the canon was only an extract
from this letter to Martyrius; therefore in no way a decree of the second General Council,
nor even of the Synod of 382, but at least eighty years later than the latter. This canon, with
an addition, was afterwards adopted by the Quinisext Synod as its ninety-fifth, without,
however, giving its origin.</p>

Catholic, and Apostolic Church of God. Thereupon, they are first sealed or anointed with
the holy oil upon the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears; and when we seal them, we
say, “The Seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost.” But Eunomians, who are baptized with only
one immersion, and Montanists, who are here called Phrygians, and Sabellians, who teach
the identity of Father and Son, and do sundry other mischievous things, and <del>the partisans
of</del> all other heresies—for there are many such here, particularly among those who come
from the country of the Galatians:—all these, when they desire to turn to orthodoxy, we
receive as heathen. On the first day we make them Christians; on the second, catechumens;
on the third, we exorcise them by breathing thrice in their face and ears; and thus we instruct
them and oblige them to spend some time in the Church, and to hear the Scriptures; and
then we baptize them.</p>

<p>Sabbatians. Sabbatius was a presbyter who adopted the sentiments of Novatius, but as
it is clear from the histories of Socrates and Sozomen, that he did not do so till at least eight
years after the celebration of this council, it is of course equally clear that this canon could
not have been framed by this council.</p>

the Easter festival with the Jews, on the fourteenth day of the first month, whatever day of

<p>Montanists. One of the older sects, so called from Montanus, who embraced Christianity
in the second century. He professed to be inspired in a peculiar way by the Holy Ghost,
and to prophesy. He was supported in his errors by two women, Priscilla and Maximilla,
who also pretended to prophesy. His heresy infected many persons, amongst others Tertullian,
but being condemned by the Church. his followers formed a sect remarkable for extreme
austerity. But although they asserted that the Holy Ghost had inspired Montanus to introduce
a system of greater perfection than the Church had before known, and condemned those
who would not join them as carnal, they did not at first innovate in any of the articles of the
Creed. This sect lasted a long time, and spread much in Phrygia and the neighbouring districts,
whence they were called Phryges and Cata-phryges, and latterly adopted the errors
of Sabellius respecting the Trinity.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Authority of the Second Ecumenical Council.</head>
<p>(Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. II., pp. 370, et seqq.)</p>
<p>Lastly, to turn to the question of the authority of this Council, it appears, first of all, that
immediately after its close, in the same year, 381, several of its acts were censured by a
Council of Latins, namely, the prolongation of the Meletian schism (by the elevation of
Flavian), and the choice of Nectarius as Bishop of Constantinople, while, as is known, the
Westerns held (the Cynic) Maximus to be the rightful bishop of that city.</p>
<p>In consequence of this, the new Synod assembled in the following year, 382, at Constantinople,
sent the Latins a copy of the decrees of faith composed the year before, expressly
calling this Synod οἰκουμενική and at the same time seeking to justify it in those points
which had been censured. Photius234 maintains that soon afterwards Pope Damasus confirmed
this synod; but, as the following will show, this confirmation could only have referred
to the creed and not to the canons. As late as about the middle of the fifth century, Pope
Leo I. spoke in a very depreciatory manner of these canons, especially of the third, which
concerned the ecclesiastical rank of Constantinople, remarking that it was never sent to the
See of Rome. Still later, Gregory the Great wrote in the same sense: Romana autem Ecclesia
eosdam canones vel gesta Synodi illius hactenus non habet, nec accepit; in hoc autem eam
accepit, quod est per eam contra Macedonium definitum.235</p>
<p>Thus, as late as the year 600, only the creed, but not the canons of the Synod of Constantinople
were accepted at Rome; but on account of its creed, Gregory the Great reckons
it as one of the four Ecumenical Councils, which he compares to the four Gospels. So also
before him the popes Vigilius and Pelagius II, reckoned this Synod among the Ecumenical
Councils.</p>
<p>The question is, from what date the Council of Constantinople was considered ecumenical
by the Latins as well as by the Greeks. We will begin with the latter. Although as we
have seen, the Synod of 382 had already designated this council as ecumenical, yet it could
not for a long time obtain an equal rank with the Council of Nicæa, for which reason the
General Council of Ephesus mentions that of Nicæa and its creed with the greatest respect,
but is totally silent as to this Synod. Soon afterwards, the so-called Robber-Synod in 449,
spoke of two (General) Councils, at Nicæa and Ephesus, and designated the latter as ἡ
δευτέρα σύνοδος, as a plain token that it did not ascribe such a high rank to the assembly
at Constantinople. It might perhaps be objected that only the Monophysites, who notoriously
ruled the Robber-Synod, used this language; but the most determined opponent of the
Monophysites, their accuser, Bishop Eusebius of Dorylæum, in like manner also brought
<note type="footnote">234 Photius, De Synodis, p. 1143, ed. Justelli.</note>
<note type="footnote">235 Greg., Epist., Lib. I., 25.</note>

<pb n="392"/>
forward only the two Synods of Nicæa and Ephesus, and declared that “he held to the faith
of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers assembled at Nicæa, and to all that was done at
the great and Holy Synod at Ephesus.”</p>
<p>The Creed of Constantinople appears for the first time to have been highly honoured
at the fourth General Council, which had it recited after that of Nicæa, and thus solemnly
approved it. Since then this Synod has been universally honoured as ecumenical by the
Greeks, and was mentioned by the Emperor Justinian with the Councils of Nicæa, Ephesus,
and Chalcedon, as of equal rank.236</p>
<p>But in the West, and especially in Rome, however satisfied people were with the decree
of faith enacted by this Synod, and its completion of the creed, yet its third canon, respecting
the rank of Constantinople, for a long time proved a hindrance to its acknowledgment.
This was especially shown at the Council of Chalcedon, and during the time immediately
following. When at that Council the creed of Constantinople was praised, repeated, and
confirmed the Papal Legates fully concurred; but when the Council also renewed and confirmed
the third canon of Constantinople, the Legates left the assembly, lodged a protest
against it on the following day, and declared that the rules of the hundred and fifty bishops
at Constantinople were never inserted among the Synodal canons (which were recognised
at Rome). The same was mentioned by Pope Leo himself, who, immediately after the close
of the Council of Chalcedon wrote to Bishop Anatolius of Constantinople: “that document
of certain bishops (i.e. the third canon of Constantinople) was never brought by your predecessors
to the knowledge of the Apostolic See.”237 Leo also, in his 105th letter to the
Empress Pulcheria, speaks just as depreciatingly of this Council of Constantinople; and
Quesnel is entirely wrong in maintaining that the Papal Legates at the Synod of Chalcedon
at first practically acknowledged the validity of the third canon of Constantinople. Bishop
Eusebius of Dorylæum was equally mistaken in maintaining at Chalcedon itself, that the
third canon had been sanctioned by the Pope; and we shall have occasion further on, in the
history of the Council of Chalcedon, to show the untenable character of both statements.</p>
<p>Pope Felix III. took the same view as Pope Leo, when, in his letter to the monks at
Constantinople and Bithynia in 485, he only spoke of three General Councils at Nicæa,
Ephesus, and Chalcedon; neither did his successor Gelasius (492–496) in his genuine decree,
De libris recipiendis, mention this Synod. It may certainly be said, on the other hand, that
in the sixth century its ecumenical character had come to be most distinctly acknowledged
in the Latin Church also, and, as we have seen above, had been expressly affirmed by the
Popes Vigilius, Pelagius II., and Gregory the Great. But this acknowledgment, even when
it is not expressly stated, only referred to the decrees on faith of the Council of Con-

<head>The Synodical Letter.238</head>
<p>To the right honourable lords our right reverend brethren and colleagues, Damasus,
Ambrosius, Britton, Valerianus, Ascholius, Anemius, Basilius and the rest of the holy bishops
assembled in the great city of Rome, the holy synod of the orthodox bishops assembled at
the great city of Constantinople sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>To recount all the sufferings inflicted on us by the power of the Arians, and to attempt
to give information to your reverences, as though you were not already well acquainted with
them, might seem superfluous. For we do not suppose your piety to hold what is befalling
us as of such secondary importance as that you stand in any need of information on matters
which cannot but evoke your sympathy. Nor indeed were the storms which beset us such
as to escape notice from their insignificance. Our persecutions are but of yesterday. The
sound of them still rings in the ears alike of those who suffered them and of those whose
love made the sufferers’ pain their own. It was but a day or two ago, so to speak, that some
released from chains in foreign lands returned to their own churches through manifold afflictions;
of others who had died in exile the relics were brought home; others again, even
after their return from exile, found the passion of the heretics still at the boiling heat, and,
slain by them with stones as was the blessed Stephen, met with a sadder fate in their own
than in a stranger’s land. Others, worn away with various cruelties, still bear in their bodies
the scars of their wounds and the marks of Christ. Who could tell the tale of fines, of disfranchisements,
of individual confiscations, of intrigues, of outrages, of prisons? In truth
all kinds of tribulation were wrought out beyond number in us, perhaps because we were
paying the penalty of sins, perhaps because the merciful God was trying us by means of the
multitude of our sufferings. For these all thanks to God, who by means of such afflictions
trained his servants and, according to the multitude of his mercies, brought us again to refreshment.
We indeed needed long leisure, time, and toil to restore the church once more,
that so, like physicians healing the body after long sickness and expelling its disease by
gradual treatment, we might bring her back to her ancient health of true religion. It is true
that on the whole we seem to have been delivered from the violence of our persecutions and
to be just now recovering the churches which have for a long time been the prey of the
heretics. But wolves are troublesome to us who, though they have been driven from the
fold, yet harry the flock up and down the glades, daring to hold rival assemblies, stirring
seditious among the people, and shrinking from nothing which can do damage to the
<note type="footnote">238 Found in Theod., H. E. v. 9. The reader is warned against inaccurate translations of the dogmatic portions.</note>

<pb n="395"/>
churches. So, as we have already said, we needs must labour all the longer. Since, however,
you showed your brotherly love to us by inviting us (as though we were your own members)
by the letters of our most religious emperor to the synod which you are gathering by divine
permission at Rome, to the end that since we alone were then condemned to suffer persecution,
you should not now, when our emperors are at one with us as to true religion, reign
apart from us, but that we, to use the Apostle’s phrase, should reign with you, our prayer
was, if it were possible, all in company to leave our churches, and rather gratify our longing
to see you than consult their needs. For who will give us wings as of a dove, and we will fly
and be at rest? But this course seemed likely to leave the churches who were just recovering
quite undefended, and the undertaking was to most of us impossible, for, in accordance
witch the letters sent a year ago from your holiness after the synod at Aquileia to the most
pious emperor Theodosius, we had journeyed to Constantinople, equipped only for travelling
so far as Constantinople, and bringing the consent of the bishops remaining in the provinces
of this synod alone. We had been in no expectation of any longer journey nor had heard a
word about it, before our arrival at Constantinople. In addition to all this, and on account
of the narrow limits of the appointed time which allowed of no preparation for a longer
journey, nor of communicating with the bishops of our communion in the provinces and
of obtaining their consent, the journey to Rome was for the majority impossible. We have
therefore adopted the next best course open to us under the circumstances, both for the
better administration of the church, and for manifesting our love towards you, by strongly
urging our most venerated, and honoured colleagues and brother bishops Cyriacus, Eusebius
and Priscianus, to consent to travel to you.</p>
<p>Through them we wish to make it plain that our disposition is all for peace with unity
for its sole object, and that we are full of zeal for the right faith. For we, whether we suffered
persecutions, or afflictions, or the threats of emperors, or the cruelties of princes, or any
other trial at the hands of heretics, have undergone all for the sake of the evangelic faith,
ratified by the three hundred and eighteen fathers at Nicæa in Bithynia. This is the faith
which ought to be sufficient for you, for us, for all who wrest not the word of the true faith;
for it is the ancient faith; it is the faith of our baptism; it is the faith that teaches us to believe
in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. According to this faith there
is one Godhead, Power and Substance of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost;
the dignity being equal, and the majesty being equal in three perfect hypostases, i.e. three
perfect persons. Thus there is no room for the heresy of Sabellius by the confusion of the
hypostases, i.e. the destruction of the personalities; thus the blasphemy of the Eunomians,
of the Arians, and of the Pneumatomachi is nullified, which divides the substance, the nature,
and the godhead, and super-induces on the uncreated consubstantial and co-eternal Trinity
a nature posterior, created and of a different substance. We moreover preserve unperverted
the doctrine of the incarnation of the Lord, holding the tradition that the dispensation of

<pb n="396"/>
the flesh is neither soulless nor mindless nor imperfect; and knowing full well that God’s
Word was perfect before the ages, and became perfect man in the last days for our salvation.</p>
<p>Let this suffice for a summary of the doctrine which is fearlessly and frankly preached
by us, and concerning which you will be able to be still further satisfied if you will deign to
read the tome of the synod of Antioch, and also that tome issued last year by the Ecumenical
Council held at Constantinople, in which we have set forth our confession of the faith at
greater length, and have appended an anathema against the heresies which innovators have
recently inscribed.</p>
<p>Now as to the particular administration of individual churches, an ancient custom, as
you know, has obtained, confirmed by the enactment of the holy fathers of Nicæa, that in
every province, the bishops of the province, and, with their consent, the neighbouring
bishops with them, should perform ordinations as expediency may require. In conforming
with these customs note that other churches have been administered by us and the priests
of the most famous churches publicly appointed. Accordingly over the new made (if the
expression be allowable) church at Constantinople, which, as through from a lion’s mouth,
we have lately snatched by God’s mercy from the blasphemy of the heretics, we have ordained
bishop the right reverend and most religious Nectarius, in the presence of the Ecumenical
Council, with common consent, before the most religious emperor Theodosius, and with
the assent of all the clergy and of the whole city. And over the most ancient and truly
apostolic church in Syria, where first the noble name of Christians was given them, the
bishops of the province and of the eastern diocese have met together and canonically ordained
bishop the right reverend and most religious Flavianus, with the consent of all the church,
who as though with one voice joined in expressing their respect for him. This rightful ordination
also received the sanction of the General Council. Of the church at Jerusalem,
mother of all the churches, we make known that the right reverend and most religious Cyril
is bishop, who was some time ago canonically ordained by the bishops of the province, and
has in several places fought a good fight against the Arians. We beseech your reverence to
rejoice at what has thus been rightly and canonically settled by us, by the intervention of
spiritual love and by the influence of the fear of the Lord, compelling the feelings of men,
and making the edification of churches of more importance than individual grace or favour.
Thus since among us there is agreement in the faith and Christian charity has been established,
we shall cease to use the phrase condemned by the apostles, I am of Paul and I of
Apollos and I of Cephas, and all appearing as Christ’s, who in us is not divided, by God’s
grace we will keep the body of the church unrent, and will boldly stand at the judgment seat
of the Lord.</p>

<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>(Bossuet, Def. Cler. Gall., Lib. vij., Cap. ix. et seqq. Abridged. Translation by Allies.)</p>
<p>The innovation of Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, is known; how he divided into
two the person of Christ. Pope St. Celestine, watchful, according to his office, over the affairs
of the Church, had charged the blessed Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria, to send him a certain
report of the doctrine of Nestorius, already in bad repute. Cyril declares this in his letter to
Nestorius; and so he writes to Celestine a complete account, and sets forth the doctrines of
Nestorius and his own; he sends him two letters from himself to Nestorius, who likewise,
by his own letters and explanations, endeavoured to draw Celestine to his side. Thus the
holy Pontiff, having been most fully informed by letters from both sides, is thus inquired
of by Cyril. “We have not confidently abstained from Communion with him (Nestorius)
before informing you of this; condescend, therefore, to unfold your judgment, that we may
clearly know whether we ought to communicate with him who cherishes such erroneous
doctrine.” And he adds, that his judgment should be written to the other Bishops also, “that
all with one mind may hold firm in one sentence.” Here is the Apostolic See manifestly
consulted by so great a man, presiding over the second, or at least the third, Patriarchal See,
and its judgment awaited; and nothing remained but that Celestine, being duly consulted,
should perform his Apostolic office. But how he did this, the Acts have shewn. In those
Acts he not only approves the letters and doctrine of Cyril, but disapproves, too, the perverse
dogma of Nestorius, and that distinctly, because he was unwilling to call the blessed Virgin
Mother of God: and he decrees that he should be deprived of the Episcopate and Communion
unless, within ten days from the date of the announcing of the sentence, he openly rejects
this faithless innovation, which endeavours to separate what Scripture joineth together—that
is, the Person of Christ. Here is the doctrine of Nestorius expressly disapproved, and a
sentence of the Roman Pontiff on a matter of Faith most clearly pronounced under threat
of deposition and excommunication: then, that nothing be wanting, the holy Pope commits
his authority to Cyril to carry into execution that sentence “associating,” he saith to Cyril,
“the authority of our See, and using our person, and place, with power.” So to Cyril; so to
Nestorius himself; so to the clergy of Constantinople; so to John of Antioch, then the Bishop
of the third or fourth Patriarchal See; so to Juvenal, Bishop of the Holy City, whom the
Council of Nice had ordered to be especially honoured: so he writes to the other Bishops
also, that the sentence given may be duly and in order made known to all. Cyril proceeds
to execute his office, and performs all that he had been commanded. He promulgates and
executes the decrees of Celestine; declares to Nestorius, that after the ten days prescribed
and set forth by Celestine, he would have no portion, intercourse, or place with the priesthood.
Nothing evidently is wanting to the Apostolical authority being most fully exercised</p>

<pb n="399"/>
<p>But Nestorius, bishop of the royal city, possessed such influence, had deceived men’s
minds with such an appearance of piety, had gained so many bishops and enjoyed such favour
with the younger Theodosius and the great men, that he could easily throw everything into
commotion; and thus there was need of an Ecumenical Council, the question being most
important, and the person of the highest dignity; because many bishops, amongst these almost
all of the East—that is, of the Patriarchate of Antioch, and the Patriarch John himself—were
ill disposed to Cyril, and seemed to favour Nestorius: because men’s feelings were divided,
and the whole empire of the East seemed to fluctuate between Cyril and Nestorius. Such
was the need of an Ecumenical Council.</p>
<p>The Emperor, moved by these and other reasons, wrote to Cyril,—“It is our will that
the holy doctrine be discussed and examined in a sacred Synod, and that be ratified which
appeareth agreeable to the right faith, whether the wrong party be pardoned by the Fathers
or no.”</p>
<p>Here we see three things: First, after the judgment of St. Celestine, another is still required,
that of the Council; secondly, that these two things would rest with the Fathers, to
judge of doctrine and of persons; thirdly, that the judgment of the Council would be decisive
and final. He adds, “those who everywhere preside over the Priesthood, and through whom
we ourselves are and shall be professing the truth, must be judges of this matter.” See on
whose faith we rest. See in whose judgment is the final and irreversible authority.</p>
<p>Both the Emperor affirmed, and the bishops confessed, that this was done according to
the Ecclesiastical Canons. And so all, and Celestine himself, prepared themselves for the
Council. Cyril does no more, though named by Celestine to execute the pontifical decree,
Nestorius remained in his original rank; the sentence of the universal Council is awaited;
and the Emperor had expressly decreed, “that before the assembling and common sentence
of the most holy Council, no change should be made in any matter at all, on any private
authority.” Rightly, and in order; for this was demanded by the majesty of an universal
Council. Wherefore, both Cyril obeyed and the bishops rested. And it was established, that
although the sentence of the Roman Pontiff on matters of Faith, and on persons judged for
violation of the Faith, had been passed and promulged, all was suspended, while the authority
of the universal Council was awaited.</p>
<p>Having gone over what preceded the Council, we review the acts of the Council itself,
and begin with the first course of proceeding. After, therefore, the bishops and Nestorius
himself were come to Ephesus, the universal Council began, Cyril being president, and
representing Celestine, as being appointed by the Pontiff himself to execute his sentence.
In the first course of proceeding this was done. First, the above-mentioned letter of the
Emperor was read, that an Ecumenical Council should be held, and all proceedings in the
mean time be suspended; this letter, I say, was read, and placed on the Acts, and it was approved
by the Fathers, that all the decrees of Celestine in the matter of Nestorius had been

<pb n="400"/>
suspended until the holy Council should give its sentence. You will ask if it was the will of
the Council merely that the Emperor should be allowed to prohibit, in the interim, effect
being given to the sentence of the Apostolic See. Not so, according to the Acts; but rather,
by the intervention of a General Council’s authority (the convocation of which, according
to the discipline of those times, was left to the Emperor), the Council itself understood that
all proceedings were of course suspended, and depended on the sentence of the Council.
Wherefore, though the decree of the Pontiff had been promulged and notified, and the ten
days had long been past, Nestorius was held by the Council itself to be a bishop, and called
by the name of most religious bishop, and by that name, too, thrice cited and summoned
to take his seat with the other bishops in the holy Council; for this expression, “to take his
seat,” is distinctly written; and it is added, “in order to answer to what was charged against
him.” For it was their full purpose that he should recognise in whatever way, the Ecumenical
Council, as he would then afterwards be, beyond doubt, answerable to it; but he refused
to come, and chose to have his doors besieged with an armed force, that no one might approach
him.</p>
<p>Thereupon, as the Emperor commanded, and the Canons required, the rule of Faith
was set forth, and the Nicene Creed read, as the standard to which all should be referred,
and then the letters of Cyril and Nestorius were examined in order. The letter of Cyril was
first brought before the judgment of the Council. That letter, I mean, concerning the Faith,
to Nestorius, so expressly approved by Pope Celestine, of which he had declared to Cyril,
“We see that you hold and maintain all that we hold and maintain”; which, by the decree
against Nestorius, published to all Churches, he had approved, and wishes to be considered
as a canonical monition against Nestorius: that letter, I repeat, was examined, at the proposition
of Cyril himself, in these words: “I am persuaded that I have in nothing departed from
the orthodox Faith, or the Nicene Creed; wherefore I beseech your Holiness to set forth
openly whether I have written this correctly, blamelessly, and in accordance with that holy
Council.”</p>
<p>And are there those who say that questions concerning the Faith, once judged by the
Roman Pontiff on his Apostolical authority, are examined in general Councils, in order to
understand their contents, but not to decide on their substance, as being still a matter of
question? Let them hear Cyril, the President of the Council; let them attend to what he
proposes for the inquiry of the Council; and though he were conscious of no error in himself
yet, not to trust himself, he asked for the sentence of the Council in these words “whether
I have written correctly and blamelessly, or not.” This Cyril, the chief of the Council, proposes
for their consideration. Who ever even heard it whispered that, after a final and irreversible
judgment of the Church on a matter of Faith, any such inquiry or question was made? It
was never done, for that would be to doubt about the Faith itself, when declared and dis-

<pb n="401"/>
cussed. But this was done after the judgment of Pope Celestine; neither Cyril, nor anyone
else, thought of any other course: that, therefore, was not a final and irreversible judgment.</p>
<p>In answer to this question the Fathers in order give their judgment—“that the Nicene
Creed, and the letter of Cyril, in all things agree and harmonise.” Here is inquiry and examination,
and then judgment. The Acts speak for themselves—we say not here a word.</p>
<p>Next that letter of Nestorius was produced, which Celestine had pronounced blasphemous
and impious. It is read: then at the instance of Cyril it is examined, “whether this, too,
be agreeable to the Faith set forth by the holy Council of the Nicene Fathers, or not.” It is
precisely the same form according to which Cyril’s letter was examined. The Fathers, in
order, give judgment that it disagreed from the Nicene Creed, and was, therefore, censurable.
The letter of Nestorius is disapproved in the same manner, by the same rule, by which that
of Cyril was approved. Here, twice in the same proceeding of the Council of Ephesus, a
judgment of the Roman Pontiff concerning the Catholic Faith, uttered and published, is
reconsidered. What he had approved, and what he had disapproved, is equally examined,
and, only after examination, confirmed.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the bishops Arcadius and Projectus, and the presbyter Philip, had
been chosen by Celestine to be present at the Council of Ephesus, with a special commission
from the Apostolic See, and the whole Council of the West. So they come from Rome to
Ephesus, and appear at the holy Council, and here the second procedure commences.</p>
<p>After reading the letter of Celestine, the Legates, in pursuance, say to the bishops: “Let
your Holiness consider the form of the letters of the holy and venerable Pope Celestine the
Bishop, who hath exhorted your Holiness, not as instructing those who are ignorant, but
as reminding those who are aware: in order that you may command to be completely and
finally settled according to the Canon of our common Faith, and the utility of the Catholic
Church, what he has before determined, and has now the goodness to remind you of.” This
is the advantage of a Council; after whose sentence there is no new discussion, or new
judgment, but merely execution. And this the Legates request to be commanded by the
Council, in which they recognise that supreme authority.</p>
<p>It behoved, also, that the Legates, sent to the Council on a special mission, should understand
whether the proceedings against Nestorius had been pursued according to the re-
quisition of the Canons, and due respect to the Apostolic See. This we have already often
said. Wherefore, with reason, they require the Acts to be communicated, “that we, too,”
say they, “may confirm them.” The proceedings themselves will declare what that confirmation
means. After that, at the request of the Legates, the Acts against Nestorius were given
them, they thus report about them at the third procedure: “We have found all things judged
canonically, and according to the Church’s discipline.” Therefore judgments of the
Apostolic See are canonically and, according to the Church’s discipline, reconsidered, after
deliberation, in a General Council, and judgment passed upon them. After the Legates had

<pb n="402"/>
approved the Acts against Nestorius communicated to them, they request that all which
had been read and done at Ephesus from the beginning, should be read afresh in public
Session, “in order,” they say, “that obeying the form of the most holy Pope Celestine, who
hath committed this care to us, we may be enabled to confirm the judgment also of your
Holiness.” After these all had been read afresh, and the Legates agreed to them, Cyril proposes
to the holy Council, “That the Legates, by their signature, as was customary, should
make plain and manifest their canonical agreement with the Council.” To this question of
Cyril the Council thus answers, and decrees that the Legates, by their subscription, confirm
the Acts; by which place this confirmation, spoken of by the Council, is clearly nothing else
but to make their assent plain and manifest, as Cyril proposed.</p>
<p>Finally, Celestine himself, after the conclusion of the whole matter, sends a letter to the
holy Council of Ephesus, which he thus begins: “At length we must rejoice at the conclusion
of evils.” The learned reader understands where he recognizes the conclusion; that is, after
the condemnation of Nestorius by the infallible authority of an Ecumenical Council, viz.,
of the whole Catholic Church. He proceeds: “We see, that you, with us, have executed this
matter so faithfully transacted.” All decree, and all execute, that is, by giving a common
judgment. Whence Celestine adds, “We have been informed of a just deposition, and a still
juster exaltation:” the deposition of Nestorius, begun, indeed, by the Roman See, but brought
to a conclusion by the sentence of the Council; to a full and complete settlement, as we have
seen above: the exaltation of Maximianus, who was substituted in place of Nestorius immediately
after the Ephesine decrees; this is the conclusion of the question. Even Celestine
himself recognises this conclusion to lie not in his own examination and judgment, but in
that of an Ecumenical Council. And this was done in that Council in which it is admitted
that the authority of the Apostolic See was most clearly set forth, not only by words, but by
deeds, of any since the birth of Christ. At least the Holy Council gives credence to Philip
uttering these true and magnificent encomiums, concerning the dignity of the Apostolic
See, and “Peter the head and pillar of the Faith, and foundation of the Catholic Church, and
by Christ’s authority administering the keys, who to this very time lives ever, and exercises
judgment, in his successors.” This, he says, after having seen all the Acts of the Council itself,
which we have mentioned, so that we may indeed understand, that all these privileges of
Peter and the Apostolic See entirely agree with the decrees of the Council, and the judgment
entered into afresh, and deliberation upon matters of Faith held after the Apostolic See.</p>

<head>Note on the Emperor’s Edict to the Synod.</head>
<p>Neither of the Emperors could personally attend the Council of Ephesus and accordingly
Theodosius II. appointed the Count Candidian, Captain of the imperial bodyguard, the
protector of the council, to sit in the room of the Emperors. In making this appointment
he addressed an edict to the synod which will be found in the Concilia and of which Hefele
gives the following synopsis.</p>
<p>(Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. III., p. 43.)</p>
<p>Candidian is to take no immediate part in the discussions on contested points of faith,
for it is not becoming that one who does not belong to the number of the bishops should
mix himself up in the examination and decision of theological controversies. On the contrary,
Candidian was to remove from the city the monks and laymen who had come or should
afterwards come to Ephesus out of curiosity, so that disorder and confusion should not be
caused by those who were in no way needed for the examination of the sacred doctrines.
He was, besides, to watch lest the discussions among the members of the Synod themselves
should degenerate into violent disputes and hinder the more exact investigation of truth;
and, on the contrary, see that every statement should be heard with attention, and that every
one put forward in view, or his objections, without let or hindrance, so that at last an unanimous
decision might be arrived at in peace by the holy Synod. But above all, Candidian
was to take care that no member of the Synod should attempt, before the close of the
transactions, to go home, or to the court, or elsewhere. Moreover, he was not to allow that
any other matter of controversy should be taken into consideration before the settlement
of the principal point of doctrine before the Council.</p>

Opera, Tom. X.</del>; Epist. iv., col. 43.)</p>
<p>To the most religious and beloved of God, fellow minister Nestorius, Cyril sends greeting
in the Lord.</p>
<p>I hear that some are rashly talking of the estimation in which I hold your holiness, and
that this is frequently the case especially at the times that meetings are held of those in authority.
And perchance they think in so doing to say something agreeable to you, but they
speak senselessly, for they have suffered no injustice at my hands, but have been exposed
by me only to their profit; this man as an oppressor of the blind and needy, and that as one
who wounded his mother with a sword. Another because he stole, in collusion with his
waiting maid, another’s money, and had always laboured under the imputation of such like
crimes as no one would wish even one of his bitterest enemies to be laden with.239 I take
little reckoning of the words of such people, for the disciple is not above his Master, nor
would I stretch the measure of my narrow brain above the Fathers, for no matter what path
of life one pursues it is hardly possible to escape the smirching of the wicked, whose mouths
are full of cursing and bitterness, and who at the last must give an account to the Judge of
all.</p>
<p>But I return to the point which especially I had in mind. And now I urge you, as a
brother in the Lord, to propose the word of teaching and the doctrine of the faith with all
accuracy to the people, and to consider that the giving of scandal to one even of the least of
those who believe in Christ, exposes a body to the unbearable indignation of God. And of
how great diligence and skill there is need when the multitude of those grieved is so great,
so that we may administer the healing word of truth to them that seek it. But this we shall
accomplish most excellently if we shall turn over the words of the holy Fathers, and are
zealous to obey their commands, proving ourselves, whether we be in the faith according
to that which is written, and conform our thoughts to their upright and irreprehensible
teaching.</p>
<p>The holy and great Synod therefore says, that the only begotten Son, born according to
nature of God the Father, very God of very God, Light of Light, by whom the Father made
all things, came down, and was incarnate, and was made man, suffered, and rose again the
third day, and ascended into heaven. These words and these decrees we ought to follow,
considering what is meant by the Word of God being incarnate and made man. For we do
<note type="footnote">239 Rohrbacher, in his famous Histoire Universelle de l’Élise Catholique, Tome IV. (Septième Edition), Livre
xxxix., p. 394, informs us that this letter gives the names of some of Cyril’s calumniators! The text he used must have been different from the one now accessible to scholars.</note>

<pb n="406"/>
not say that the nature of the Word was changed and became flesh, or that it was converted
into a whole man consisting of soul and body; but rather that the Word having personally
united to himself flesh animated by a rational soul, did in an ineffable and inconceivable
manner become man, and was called the Son of Man, not merely as willing or being pleased
to be so called, neither on account of taking to himself a person, but because the two natures
being brought together in a true union, there is of both one Christ and one Son; for the
difference of the natures is not taken away by the union, but rather the divinity and the
humanity make perfect for us the one Lord Jesus Christ by their ineffable and inexpressible
union. So then he who had an existence before all ages and was born of the Father, is said
to have been born according to the flesh of a woman, not as though his divine nature received
its beginning of existence in the holy Virgin, for it needed not any second generation after
that of the Father (for it would be absurd and foolish to say that he who existed before all
ages, coeternal with the Father, needed any second beginning of existence), but since, for
us and for our salvation, he personally united to himself an human body, and came forth
of a woman, he is in this way said to be born after the flesh; for he was not first born a
common man of the holy Virgin, and then the Word came down and entered into him, but
the union being made in the womb itself, he is said to endure a birth after the flesh, ascribing
to himself the birth of his own flesh. On this account we say that he suffered and rose again;
not as if God the Word suffered in his own nature stripes, or the piercing of the nails, or
any other wounds, for the Divine nature is incapable of suffering, inasmuch as it is incorporeal,
but since that which had become his own body suffered in this way, he is also said to
suffer for us; for he who is in himself incapable of suffering was in a suffering body. In the
same manner also we conceive respecting his dying; for the Word of God is by nature immortal
and incorruptible, and life and life-giving; since, however, his own body did, as Paul
says, by the grace of God taste death for every man, he himself is said to have suffered death
for us, not as if he had any experience of death in his own nature (for it would be madness
to say or think this), but because, as I have just said, his flesh tasted death. In like manner
his flesh being raised again, it is spoken of as his resurrection, not as if he had fallen into
corruption (God forbid), but because his own body was raised again. We, therefore, confess
one Christ and Lord, not as worshipping. a man with the Word (lest this expression “with
the Word” should suggest to the mind the idea of division), but worshipping him as one
and the same, forasmuch as the body of the Word, with which he sits with the Father, is not
separated from the Word himself, not as if two sons were sitting with him, but one by the
union with the flesh. If, however, we reject the personal union as impossible or unbecoming,
we fall into the error of speaking of two sons, for it will be necessary to distinguish, and to
say, that he who was properly man was honoured with the appellation of Son, and that he
who is properly the Word of God, has by nature both the name and the reality of Sonship.
We must not, therefore, divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons. Neither will it at

<pb n="407"/>
all avail to a sound faith to hold, as some do, an union of persons; for the Scripture has not
said that the Word united to himself the person of man, but that he was made flesh. This
expression, however, “the Word was made flesh,” can mean nothing else but that he partook
of flesh and blood like to us; he made our body his own, and came forth man from a woman,
not casting off his existence as God, or his generation of God the Father, but even in taking
to himself flesh remaining what he was. This the declaration of the correct faith proclaims
everywhere. This was the sentiment of the holy Fathers; therefore they ventured to call the
holy Virgin, the Mother of God, not as if the nature of the Word or his divinity had its beginning
from the holy Virgin, but because of her was born that holy body with a rational
soul, to which the Word being personally united is said to be born according to the flesh.
These things, therefore, I now write unto you for the love of Christ, beseeching you as a
brother, and testifying to you before Christ and the elect angels, that you would both think
and teach these things with us, that the peace of the Churches may be preserved and the
bond of concord and love continue unbroken amongst the Priests of God.</p>

<head>Historical Introduction to St. Cyril’s Anathematisms.</head>
<p>There has been some difference of opinion among the learned as to whether St. Cyril’s
Synodal letter which has at its end the anathemas against Nestorius, which hereafter follow,
was formally approved at the Council of Ephesus. The matter is one only of archeological
and historical interest, for from a theological point of view the question is entirely uninteresting,
since there is no possible doubt that the synod endorsed St. Cyril’s teaching and for
that express reason proceeded at their first session to excommunicate Nestorius. Further
there is no one that disputes that the anathematisms were received at the next General
Council. i.e., of Chalcedon, only twenty years later, and that Theodoret was condemned by
the Fifth Ecumenical Council because he wrote against these very Anathemas. This being
the case, to those who value the decrees of Ecumenical Councils because of their ecumenical
character, it is quite immaterial whether these anathematisms were received and approved
by the third Council or no, provided, which is indisputably the case, they have been approved
by some one council of ecumenical authority, so as to become thereby part and parcel of
the ecumenical faith of the Church.</p>
<p>But the historical question is one of some interest, and I shall very briefly consider it.
We have indeed the “Acta” of this council, but I cannot but agree with the very learned Jesuit
Petavius and the Gallican Tillemont in thinking them in a very unsatisfactory condition. I
am fully aware of the temerity of making such a suggestion, but I cannot help feeling that
in the remarks of the Roman representatives, especially in those of the presbyter-legate,
there is some anachronism. Be this as it may, it is a fact that the Acts do not recite that this
letter of Cyril’s was read, nor do they state that the Anathemas were received. I would suggest,
however, that for those who defend John of Antioch, and criticise the action of St. Cyril, it
is the height of inconsistency to deny that the Council adopted the Anathemas. If it was
the bitterly partisan assembly that they would have us believe, absolutely under the control
of Cyril, there is nothing that, ὰ priori, they would have been more sure to do than adopt
the Anathemas which were universally looked upon as the very fulcrum on which the whole
matter turned.</p>
<p>Bishop Hefele was at first of opinion that the letter was merely read, being led to this
conclusion by the silence of the Acts with regard to any acceptance of it, and indeed at first
wrote on that side, but he afterwards saw grounds to change his mind and expresses them
with his usual clearness, in the following words:</p>
<p>(Hefele, Hist. of Councils. Vol. III., p. 48, note 2.)</p>
<p>We were formerly of opinion that these anathematisms were read at Ephesus, but not
expressly confirmed, as there is hardly anything on the subject in the Acts. But in the Fifth
Ecumenical Council (collatio vj.) it is said: “The holy Council at Chalcedon approved this

<pb n="411"/>
teaching of Cyril of blessed memory, and received his Synodical letters, to one of which are
appended the xij. anathemas” (Mansi, t. ix., p. 341; Hardouin, t. iij., p. 167). If, however,
the anathematisms of Cyril were expressly confirmed at Chalcedon, there was even more
reason for doing so at Ephesus. And Ibas, in his well-known letter to Maris, says expressly
that the Synod of Ephesus confirmed the anathematisms of Cyril, and the same was asserted
even by the bishops of Antioch at Ephesus in a letter to the Emperor.</p>
<p>From all these considerations it would seem that Tillemont’s240 conclusion is well
founded that the Synod certainly discussed the anathemas of Cyril in detail, but that here,
as in many other places, there are parts of the Acts lacking. I shall add the opinion of
Petavius.</p>
<p>(Petavius, De Incarnatione, Lib. VI., cap. xvij.)</p>
<p>The Acts do not tell us what judgment the Synod of Ephesus gave with respect to the
third letter of Cyril, and with regard to the anathemas attached to it. But the Acts in other
respects also have not come down to us in their integrity. That that third letter was received
and approved by the Ephesine Council there can be no doubt, and this the Catholics shewed
in their dispute with the Acephali in the Collation held at Constantinople under the Emperor
Justinian in the year of Christ 811. For at that memorable meeting something was shewn
forth concerning this letter and its anathemas, which has a connexion with the matter in
hand, and therefore must not be omitted. At that meeting the Opposers, that is the
Acephali, the enemies of the Council of Chalcedon, made this objection against that
Council: “The <del>letter</del> of the Twelve Anathemas which is inserted in the holy Council of
Ephesus, and which you cannot deny to be synodical, why did not Chalcedon receive it?”
etc., etc.</p>
<p>From this it is evident that the prevailing opinion, then as now, was that the Twelve
Anathemas were defined as part of the faith by the Council of Ephesus. Perhaps I may close
this treatment of the subject in the words of Denziger, being the caption he gives the xij.
Anathematisms in his Enchiridion, under “Decrees of the Third Ecumenical Council, that
of Ephesus.” “The Third Synod received these anathematisms; the Fourth Synod placed
them in its Acts and styled the Epistles of Cyril ‘Canonical’; the Fifth Synod defended them.”</p>

<p>To the most reverend and God-loving fellow-minister Nestorius, Cyril and the synod
assembled in Alexandria, of the Egyptian Province, Greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>When our Saviour says clearly: “He that loveth father or mother more than me is not
worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me,” what
is to become of us, from whom your Holiness requires that we love you more than Christ
the Saviour of us all? Who can help us in the day of judgment, or what kind of excuse shall
we find for thus keeping silence so long, with regard to the blasphemies made by you against
him? If you injured yourself alone, by teaching and holding such things, perhaps it would
be less matter; but you have greatly scandalized the whole Church, and have cast among the
people the leaven of a strange and new heresy. And not to those there <del>i.e. at Constantinople</del>
only; but also to those everywhere <del>the books of your explanation were sent</del>. How can we
any longer, under these circumstances, make a defence for our silence, or how shall we not
be forced to remember that Christ said: “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth:
I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his
father, and the daughter against her mother.” For if faith be injured, let there be lost the
honour due to parents, as stale and tottering, let even the law of tender love towards children
and brothers be silenced, let death be better to the pious than living; “that they might obtain
a better resurrection,” as it is written.</p>
<p>Behold, therefore, how we, together with the holy synod which met in great Rome,
presided over by the most holy and most reverend brother and fellow-minister, Celestine
the Bishop, also testify by this third letter to you, and counsel you to abstain from these
mischievous and distorted dogmas, which you hold and teach, and to receive the right faith,
handed down to the churches from the beginning through the holy Apostles and Evangelists,
who “were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the Word.” And if your holiness have not a mind
to this according to the limits defined in the writings of our brother of blessed memory and
most reverend fellow-minister Celestine, Bishop of the Church of Rome, be well assured
then that you have no lot with us, nor place or standing (λόγον) among the priests and
bishops of God. For it is not possible for us to overlook the churches thus troubled, and the
people scandalized, and the right faith set aside, and the sheep scattered by you, who ought
to save them, if indeed we are ourselves adherents of the right faith, and followers of the
devotion of the holy fathers. And we are in communion with all those laymen and clergymen
cast out or deposed by your holiness on account of the faith; for it is not right that those,
who resolved to believe rightly, should suffer by your choice; for they do well in opposing

<pb n="413"/>
you. This very thing you have mentioned in your epistle written to our most holy and fellowbishop
Celestine of great Rome.</p>
<p>But it would not be sufficient for your reverence to confess with us only the symbol of
the faith set out some time ago by the Holy Ghost at the great and holy synod convened in
Nice: for you have not held and interpreted it rightly, but rather perversely; even though
you confess with your voice the form of words. But in addition, in writing and by oath, you
must confess that you also anathematize those polluted and unholy dogmas of yours, and
that you will hold and teach that which we all, bishops, teachers, and leaders of the people
both East and West, hold. The holy synod of Rome and we all agreed on the epistle written
to your Holiness from the Alexandrian Church as being right and blameless. We have added
to these our own letters and that which it is necessary for you to hold and teach, and what
you should be careful to avoid. Now this is the Faith of the Catholic and Apostolic Church
to which all Orthodox Bishops, both East and West, agree:</p>
<p>“We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible,
and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father, that is,
of the substance of the Father; God of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God, begotten,
not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, both those
in heaven and those in the earth. Who for us men and for our salvation, came down, and
was incarnate, and was made man. He suffered, and rose again the third day. He ascended
into the heavens, from thence he shall come to judge both the quick and the dead. And in
the Holy Ghost: But those that say, There was a time when he was not, and, before he was
begotten he was not, and that he was made of that which previously was not, or that he was
of some other substance or essence; and that the Son of God was capable of change or alteration;
those the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.”</p>
<p>Following in all points the confessions of the Holy Fathers which they made (the Holy
Ghost speaking in them), and following the scope of their opinions, and going, as it were,
in the royal way, we confess that the Only begotten Word of God, begotten of the same
substance of the Father, True God from True God, Light from Light, through Whom all
things were made, the things in heaven and the things in the earth, coming down for our
salvation, making himself of no reputation (καθεὶς ἑαυτὸν εἰς κένωσιν), was incarnate and
made man; that is, taking flesh of the holy Virgin, and having made it his own from the
womb, he subjected himself to birth for us, and came forth man from a woman, without
casting off that which he was; but although he assumed flesh and blood, he remained what
he was, God in essence and in truth. Neither do we say that his flesh was changed into the
nature of divinity, nor that the ineffable nature of the Word of God was laid aside for the
nature of flesh; for he is unchanged and absolutely unchangeable, being the same always,
according to the Scriptures. For although visible and a child in swaddling clothes, and even
in the bosom of his Virgin Mother, he filled all creation as God, and was a fellow-ruler with

<pb n="414"/>
him who begat him, for the Godhead is without quantity and dimension, and cannot have
limits.</p>
<p>Confessing the Word to be made one with the flesh according to substance, we adore
one Son and Lord Jesus Christ: we do not divide the God from the man, nor separate him
into parts, as though the two natures were mutually united in him only through a sharing
of dignity and authority (for that is a novelty and nothing else), neither do we give separately
to the Word of God the name Christ and the same name separately to a different one born
of a woman; but we know only one Christ, the Word from God the Father with his own
Flesh. For as man he was anointed with us, although it is he himself who gives the Spirit to
those who are worthy and not in measure, according to the saying of the blessed Evangelist
John.</p>
<p>But we do not say that the Word of God dwelt in him as in a common man born of the
holy Virgin, lest Christ be thought of as a God-bearing man; for although the Word tabernacled
among us, it is also said that in Christ “dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily”;
but we understand that he became flesh, not just as he is said to dwell in the saints, but we
define that that tabernacling in him was according to equality (κατὰ τον ἴσον ἐν αὐτῷ
τρόπον). But being made one κατὰ φύσιν,241 and not converted into flesh, he made his
indwelling in such a way, as we may say that the soul of man does in his own body.</p>
<p>One therefore is Christ both Son and Lord, not as if a man had attained only such a
conjunction with God as consists in a unity242 of dignity alone or of authority. For it is not
equality of honour which unites natures; for then Peter and John, who were of equal honour
with each other, being both Apostles and holy disciples <del>would have been one, and</del>, yet the
two are not one. Neither do we understand the manner of conjunction to be apposition,
for this does not suffice for natural oneness (πρὸς ἕνωσον φυσικήν). Nor yet according to
relative participation, as we are also joined to the Lord, as it is written “we are one Spirit in
him.” Rather we deprecate the term of “junction” (συναφείας) as not having sufficiently
signified the oneness. But we do not call the Word of God the Father, the God nor the Lord
of Christ, lest we openly cut in two the one Christ, the Son and Lord, and fall under the
charge of blasphemy, making him the God and Lord of himself. For the Word of God, as
we have said already, was made hypostatically one in flesh, yet he is God of all and he rules
all; but he is not the slave of himself, nor his own Lord. For it is foolish, or rather impious,
to think or teach thus. For he said that God was his Father, although he was God by nature,
and of his substance. Yet we are not ignorant that while he remained God, he also became
man and subject to God, according to the law suitable to the nature of the manhood. But
how could he become the God or Lord of himself? Consequently as man, and with regard
<note type="footnote">241 Vide notes on this expression.</note>
<note type="footnote">242 This passage is very difficult and I have followed the Latin in omitting one Θεόν.</note>

<pb n="415"/>
to the measure of his humiliation, it is said that he is equally with us subject to God; thus
he became under the Law, although as God he spake the Law and was the Law-giver.</p>
<p>We are careful also how we say about Christ: “I worship the One clothed on account
of the One clothing him, and on account of the Unseen, I worship the Seen.” It is horrible
to say in this connexion as follows: “The assumed as well as the assuming have the name
of God.” For the saying of this divides again Christ into two, and puts the man separately
by himself and God also by himself. For this saying denies openly the Unity according to
which one is not worshipped in the other, nor does God exist together with the other; but
Jesus Christ is considered as One, the Only-begotten Son, to be honoured with one adoration
together with his own flesh.</p>
<p>We confess that he is the Son, begotten of God the Father, and Only-begotten God; and
although according to his own nature he was not subject to suffering, yet he suffered for us
in the flesh according to the Scriptures, and although impassible, yet in his Crucified Body
he made his own the sufferings of his own flesh; and by the grace of God he tasted death for
all: he gave his own Body thereto, although he was by nature himself the life and the resurrection,
in order that, having trodden down death by his unspeakable power, first in his
own flesh, he might become the first born from the dead, and the first-fruits of them that
slept. And that he might make a way for the nature of man to attain incorruption, by the
grace of God (as we just now said), he tasted death for every man, and after three days rose
again, having despoiled hell. So although it is said that the resurrection of the dead was
through man, yet we understand that man to have been the Word of God, and the power
of death was loosed through him, and he shall come in the fulness of time as the One Son
and Lord, in the glory of the Father, in order to judge the world in righteousness, as it is
written.</p>
<p>We will necessarily add this also. Proclaiming the death, according to the flesh, of the
Only-begotten Son of God, that is Jesus Christ, confessing his resurrection from the dead,
and his ascension into heaven, we offer the Unbloody Sacrifice in the churches, and so go
on to the mystical thanksgivings, and are sanctified, having received his Holy Flesh and the
Precious Blood of Christ the Saviour of us all. And not as common flesh do we receive it;
God forbid: nor as of a man sanctified and associated with the Word according to the unity
of worth, or as having a divine indwelling, but as truly the Life-giving and very flesh of the
Word himself. For he is the Life according to his nature as God, and when he became united
to his Flesh, he made it also to be Life-giving, as also he said to us: Verily, verily, I say unto
you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his Blood. For we must not think
that it is flesh of a man like us (for how can the flesh of man be life-giving by its own nature?)
but as having become truly the very own of him who for us both became and was called Son
of Man. Besides, what the Gospels say our Saviour said of himself, we do not divide between
two hypostases or persons. For neither is he, the one and only Christ, to be thought of as

<pb n="416"/>
double, although of two (ἐκ δύο) and they diverse, yet he has joined them in an indivisible
union, just as everyone knows a man is not double although made up of soul and body, but
is one of both. Wherefore when thinking rightly, we transfer the human and the divine to
the same person (παρ’ ἑνὸς εἰρῆσθαι).</p>
<p>For when as God he speaks about himself: “He who hath seen me hath seen the Father,”
and “I and my Father are one,” we consider his ineffable divine nature according to which
he is One with his Father through the identity of essence—“The image and impress and
brightness of his glory.” But when not scorning the measure of his humanity, he said to the
Jews: “But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth.” Again no less than
before we recognize that he is the Word of God from his identity and likeness to the Father
and from the circumstances of his humanity. For if it is necessary to believe that being by
nature God, he became flesh, that is, a man endowed with a reasonable soul, what reason
can certain ones have to be ashamed of this language about him, which is suitable to him
as man? For if he should reject the words suitable to him as man, who compelled him to
become man like us? And as he humbled himself to a voluntary abasement (κένωσιν) for
us, for what cause can any one reject the words suitable to such abasement? Therefore all
the words which are read in the Gospels are to be applied to One Person, to One hypostasis
of the Word Incarnate. For the Lord Jesus Christ is One, according to the Scriptures, although
he is called “the Apostle and High Priest of our profession,” as offering to God and the
Father the confession of faith which we make to him, and through him to God even the
Father and also to the Holy Spirit; yet we say he is, according to nature, the Only-begotten
of God. And not to any man different from him do we assign the name of priesthood, and
the thing, for he became “the Mediator between God and men,” and a Reconciler unto peace,
having offered himself as a sweet smelling savour to God and the Father. Therefore also he
said: “Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou prepared me: In burnt
offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the
volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.” For on account of us he
offered his body as a sweet smelling savour, and not for himself; for what offering or sacrifice
was needed for himself, who as God existed above all sins? For “all have sinned and come
short of the glory of God,” so that we became prone to fall, and the nature of man has fallen
into sin, yet not so he (and therefore we fall short of his glory). How then can there be further
doubt that the true Lamb died for us and on our account? And to say that he offered himself
for himself and us, could in no way escape the charge of impiety. For he never committed
a fault at all, neither did he sin. What offering then did he need, not having sin for which
sacrifices are rightly offered? But when he spoke about the Spirit, he said: “He shall glorify
me.” If we think rightly, we do not say that the One Christ and Son as needing glory from
another received glory from the Holy Spirit; for neither greater than he nor above him is
his Spirit, but because he used the Holy Spirit to show forth his own divinity in his mighty

<pb n="417"/>
works, therefore he is said to have been glorified by him just as if any one of us should say
concerning his inherent strength for example, or his knowledge of anything, “They glorified
me.” For although the Spirit is the same essence, yet we think of him by himself, as he is
the Spirit and not the Son; but he is not different from him; for he is called the Spirit of truth
and Christ is the Truth, and he is sent by him, just as, moreover, he is from God and the
Father. When then the Spirit worked miracles through the hands of the holy apostles after
the Ascension of Our Lord Jesus Christ into heaven, he glorified him. For it is believed that
he who works through his own Spirit is God according to nature. Therefore he said: “He
shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” But we do not say this as if the Spirit is
wise and powerful through some sharing with another; for he is all perfect and in need of
no good thing. Since, therefore, he is the Spirit of the Power and Wisdom of the Father
(that is, of the Son), he is evidently Wisdom and Power.</p>
<p>And since the holy Virgin brought forth corporally God made one with flesh according
to nature, for this reason we also call her Mother of God, not as if the nature of the Word
had the beginning of its existence from the flesh.</p>
<p>For “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word was with
God,” and he is the Maker of the ages, coeternal with the Father, and Creator of all; but, as
we have already said, since he united to himself hypostatically human nature from her womb,
also he subjected himself to birth as man, not as needing necessarily in his own nature birth
in time and in these last times of the world, but in order that he might bless the beginning
of our existence, and that that which sent the earthly bodies of our whole race to death,
might lose its power for the future by his being born of a woman in the flesh. And this: “In
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children,” being removed through him, he showed the truth
of that spoken by the prophet, “Strong death swallowed them up, and again God hath wiped
away every tear from off all faces.”243 For this cause also we say that he attended, having
been called, and also blessed, the marriage in Cana of Galilee, with his holy Apostles in accordance
with the economy. We have been taught to hold these things by the holy Apostles
and Evangelists, and all the God-inspired Scriptures, and in the true confessions of the
blessed Fathers.</p>
<note type="footnote">243 There is a most curious blunder in the editing of this Epistle in Migne, where this passage, which is but
one text, viz.: Isaiah xxv. 8 is made into two, the first few words being assigned in the margin to Hosea xiii. 14.
As a matter of fact the whole sentence is turned into nonsense by making the words καὶ πάλιν as a connective
supplied by St. Cyril. What the text really says is that Death prevailed indeed, but God wiped away again the
tears death had caused. The same error is found in the letter as it occurs in Labbe and Cossart, and it should be
remarked that it is both in the Greek and Latin. I rather suspect that St. Cyril had a purer text of the LXX. than
ours which read—“And he hath swallowed death up and hath wiped away, etc.,” as the Vulgate and A.V. read.
This is the reading the context certainly seems to call for.</note>

<p>If anyone will not confess that the Emmanuel is very God, and that therefore the Holy

<p>The Anathematisms of the Heretic Nestorius Against Cyril.</p>
<p>(Found best in Migne’s edition of Marius Mercator.)</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>If anyone says that the Emmanuel is true God, and not rather God with us, that is, that
he has united himself to a like nature with ours, which he assumed from the Virgin Mary,
and dwelt in it; and if anyone calls Mary the mother of God the Word, and not rather
mother of him who is Emmanuel; and if he maintains that God the Word has changed
himself into the flesh, which he only assumed in order to make his Godhead visible, and to
be found in form as a man, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Petavius.245</p>
<p>(De Incarnatione, Lib. vj. cap. xvij.)</p>
<p>In this anathematism certain words are found in the Greek copy of Dionysius which
are lacking in the ordinary copies, viz. “according as it is written, ‘And the Word was made
flesh’;” unless forsooth Dionysius supplied them of his own authority. For in the Lateran
Synod in the time of Martin I. this anathematism was quoted without the appended words.</p>
<p>This anathematism breaks to pieces the chief strength of the Nestorian impiety. For it
sets forth two facts. The one that the Emmanuel, that is he who was born of a woman and
dwelt with us, is God: the other, that Mary who bare such an one is Mother of God. That
Christ is God is clearly proved from the Nicene Creed, and he shews that the same that was
in the beginning the Son of God, afterwards took flesh and was born of Mary, without any
change or confusion of natures.</p>
<note type="footnote">245 Petavius gives a scholion on every anathematism and a résumé of the Orientals’ objections and of Theodoret’s criticisms, with answers.</note>

<pb n="420"/>
<p>St. Cyril explains that by σαρκικῶς, carnaliter, he meant nothing else than κατα σάρκα,
secundum carnem, “according to the flesh.” And it was necessary to use this expression to
overthrow the perfidy of Nestorius; so that we may understand that the most holy Virgin
was the parent not of a simple and bare man, but of God the Word, not in that he was God,
but in that he had taken flesh. For God the Father was the parent of the same Son θεϊκῶς246
(divinely) as his mother was σαρκικῶς (after the flesh). And the word (σαρκικῶς) in no
degree lessens the dignity of his begetting and bringing forth; for it shews that his flesh was
not simulated or shadowed forth; but true and like to ours. Amphilochius distinctly uses
the word, saying “Except he had been born carnally (σαρκικῶς), never wouldest thou have
been born spiritually (πνευματικῶς ).” Cf. St. Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. 51).</p>
<p>Theodoret misunderstood St. Cyril to teach in this first anathematism that the Word
was changed into the flesh he assumed. But Cyril rightly treated this whole accusation as a
foolish calumny.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Word Θεοτόκος .</head>
<p>There have been some who have tried to reduce all the great theological controversies
on the Trinity and on the Incarnation to mere logomachies, and have jeered at those who
could waste their time and energies over such trivialities. For example, it has been said that
the real difference between Arius and Athanasius was nothing more nor less than an iota,
and that even Athanasius himself, in his more placid, and therefore presumably more rational
moods, was willing to hold communion with those who differed from him and who still
rejected the homousion. But however catching and brilliant such remarks may be, they lack
all solid foundation in truth. It is perfectly manifest that a person so entirely lacking in
discrimination as not to see the enormous difference between identity and likeness is not
one whose opinion on such a point can be of much value. A brilliant historian is not necessarily
an accurate historian, far less need he be a safe guide in matters of theological definition.</p>
<p>A similar attempt to reduce to a logomachy the difference between the Catholic faith
and Nestorianism has been made by some writers of undoubted learning among Protestants,
notably by Fuchs and Schröckh. But as in the case of the homousios so, too, in the case of
the theotocos the word expresses a great, necessary, and fundamental doctrine of the Catholic
faith. It is not a matter of words, but of things, and the mind most unskilled in theology
cannot fail to grasp the enormous difference there is between affirming, as does Nestorianism,
that a God indwelt a man with a human personality of his own distinct from the personality
of the indwelling god; and that God assumed to himself human nature, that is a human
body and a human soul, but without human personality.</p>
<p>(Wm. Bright, St. Leo on the Incarnation, pp. 160, 161.)</p>
<p>It is, then, clear that the question raised by the wide circulation of the discourses of
Nestorius as archbishop of Constantinople was not verbal, but vital. Much of his language
was irrelevant, and indicated some confusedness of thought: much would, of itself, admit
of an orthodox construction; in one of the latest of his sermons, which Garnier dates on
Sunday, December 14, 430, he grants that “Theotocos” might be used as signifying that “the
temple which was formed in Mary by the Holy Spirit was united to the Godhead;” but it
was impossible not to ask whether by “the temple” he meant the body of Jesus, or Jesus
himself regarded as a human individual existing ἰδίᾳ, ἰδικῶς, ἀνὰ μέρος—as Cyril represents
his theory—and whether by “union” he meant more than a close alliance, ejusdem generis,
<note type="footnote">247 Cf. Bp. Lightfoot’s criticism on Gibbon as an historian, The Apostolic Fathers, Vol. I., p. 46 n. Macaulay’s
History of England will of course instantly present itself to the reader as a sample of the brilliant variety of histories referred to in the text.</note>

<pb n="422"/>
in the last analysis, with the relation between God and every saint, or, indeed, every Christian
in true moral fellowship with him—an alliance which would amount, in Cyril’s phrase, to
no more than a “relative union,” and would reduce the Saviour to a “Theophoros,” the title
claimed of old by one of his chief martyrs. And the real identity of Nestorius’s view with
that of Theodore [of Mopsuestia] was but too plainly exhibited by such statements as occur
in some of the extracts preserved in Cyril’s treatise Against Nestorius—to the effect that
Christ was one with the Word by participation in dignity; that “the man” was partaker of
Divine power, and in that sense not mere man; that he was adored together with the Word;
and that “My Lord and my God” was a doxology to the Father; and above all, by the words
spoken at Ephesus, “I can never allow that a child of three months old was God.”</p>
<p>It is no part of my duty to defend the truth of either the Catholic or Nestorian proposition—
each has found many adherents in most ages since it was first started, and probably
what is virtually Nestorianism is to-day far more widely held among persons deemed to be
orthodox than is commonly supposed. Be this as it may, Nestorianism is clearly subversive
of the whole Catholic Doctrine of the Incarnation, and therefore the importance of the word
Θεοτόκος cannot be exaggerated.</p>
<p>I shall treat the word Theotocos under two heads; (1) Its history (2) its meaning, first
however quoting Bp. Pearson’s words on its Conciliar authority. (Pearson, Exp. of the
Creed, Art. III., n. 37). “It is plain that the Council of Ephesus which condemned Nestorius
confirmed this title Θεοτόκος; I say confirmed it; for it is evident that it was before used in
the Church, by the tumult which arose at the first denial of it by Anastasius [Nestorius’s
presbyter]; and so confirmed it as received before, because they approved the Epistles of St.
Cyril, who proved it by the usage of those Fathers which preceded him.”</p>
<p>(1) History of Word Θεοτόκος.</p>
<p>It has not been unfrequently assumed that the word Theotocos was coined to express
the peculiar view of the Incarnation held by St. Cyril. Such however, is an entire mistake.
It was an old term of Catholic Theology, and the very word was used by bishop Alexander
in a letter from the synod held at Alexandria in a.d. 320,248 to condemn the Arian heresy
(more than a hundred years before the meeting of the Council of Ephesus); “After this, we
receive the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, of which Jesus Christ our Lord became
the first-fruits; who bore a body in truth, not in semblance, which he derived from Mary
the Mother of God (ἐκ τῆς Θεοτόκου Μαρίας).”249 The same word had been used by many
church writers among whom may be mentioned St. Athanasius, who says, “As the flesh was
<note type="footnote">248 The date is not certain, it may have been a year or so different.</note>
<note type="footnote">249 Theod., Hist. Eccl., I., 4.</note>

<pb n="423"/>
born of Mary, the Mother of God, so we say that he, the Word, was himself born of Mary”
(Orat. c. Arian., iij., 14, 29, 33; also iv., 32). See also Eusebius (Vit. Const., iij., 43); St. Cyril
of Jerusalem (Cat., x., 9); and especially Origen, who (says Bp. Pearson) “did not only use,
but expound at large the meaning of that title Θεοτόκος in his first tome on the Epistle to
the Romans, as Socrates and Liberatus testify.”250 (Cf. Origen in Deut. xxii., 23; vol. ij., p.
391. A; in Luc. apud Galland, Bib. Patr., vol. xiv., append., p. 87, D). A list is given by Dr.
Routh, in his Reliquiæ Sacræ. Vol. ij., p. 215 (1st Ed.), 332 (2d Ed.).</p>
<p>In fact Theodore of Mopsuestia was the first to object to it, so far as we know, writing
as follows: “Mary bare Jesus, not the Word, for the Word was and remained omnipresent,
although from the beginning he dwelt in Jesus in a peculiar manner. Thus Mary is properly
the Mother of Christ (Christotocos) but not the mother of God (Theotocos). Only figuratively,
per anaphoram, can she be called Theotocos also, because God was in Christ in a remarkable
manner. Properly she bare a man, in whom the union with the Word was begun,
but was still so little completed, that he was not yet called the Son of God.” And in another
place he says: “It is madness to say that God is born of the Virgin.<gap reason=" omitted"/>Not God, but the temple in which God dwelt, is born of Mary.”251 How far Theodore had departed from the teaching
of the Apostolic days may be seen by the following quotations from St. Ignatius. “There is
one only physician, of flesh and spirit, generate and ingenerate, God in man, true Life in
death, Son of Mary and of God, first passible and then impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord.”252
Further on in the same epistle he says: “For our God, Jesus the Christ, was borne in the
womb by Mary etc.”253 With the first of these passages Bp. Lightfoot very aptly compares
the following from Melito. “Since he was incorporeal, he fashioned a body for himself of
our likeness<gap reason=" omitted"/>he was carried by Mary and clothed by his Father, he trod the earth and he
filled the heavens.”254</p>
<p>Theodore was forced by the exigencies of his position to deny the doctrine of the communicatio
idiomatum which had already at that early date come to be well understood, at
least so far as practice is concerned.</p>
<p>(Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. iii., p. 8.)</p>
<p>This doctrine, as is well known is predicating the same properties of the two natures in
Christ, not in abstracto (Godhead and manhood), but in concreto (God and man). Christ

himself had declared in St. John iii., 16: “God…gave his only begotten Son” (namely, to
death), and similarly St. Peter declared (Acts iii., 15): “ye<gap reason=" omitted"/>killed the Prince of Life,” when
in fact the being given up and being killed is a property (ἰδίωμα = predicate) of man, not
of God (the only begotten, the Prince of Life). In the same way Clement of Rome, for example,
spoke of “the sufferings of God” (παθήματα Θεοῦ) (1 Ad Cor. 2), Ignatius of Antioch
(Ad Ephes., c. 1, and Ad Rom., 6) of an αἷμα and πάθος Θεοῦ, Tatian of a Θεὸς πεπονθὼς
(Ad Græcos, c. 13); Barnabas teaches (c. 7) that “the Son of God could not suffer except on
our behalf<gap reason=" omitted"/>and on our behalf he has brought the vessel of his Spirit as a sacrifice.” Similarly Irenæus (iii., 16, 6) says, “The Only-begotten impassible Word (unigenitus impassibilis) has become passible” (passibilis); and Athanasius, ἐσταυρώμενον εἶναι Θεὸν (Ep. ad Epictet.,
n. 10, t. j., p. 726. ed. Patav.)</p>
<p>It is, however, to be remarked that the properties of the one nature were never transferred
to the other nature in itself, but always to the Person who is at the same time both man and
God. Human attributes were not ascribed to the Godhead, but to God, and vice versâ.</p>
<p>For a full treatment of the figure of speech called the communicatio idiomatum the
reader is referred to the great works on Theology where it will be found set forth at large,
with its restrictions specified and with examples of its use. A brief but interesting note on
it will be found in St. John Damascene’s famous treatise De Fide Orthodoxa, Book III., iij.</p>
<p>(Migne’s Pat. Græc., col. 994).</p>
<p>(2) Meaning of the Word Θεοτόκος.</p>
<p>We pass now to the meaning of the word, having sufficiently traced the history of its
use. Bishop Pearson says: “This name was first in use in the Greek Church, who, delighting
in the happy compositions of that language, called the blessed Virgin Theotocos. From
whence the Latins in imitation styled her Virginem Deiparam et Deigenitricem.”255 In the
passage to which the words just quoted are a portion of a footnote, he says: “Wherefore
from these three, a true conception, nutrition, and parturition, we must acknowledge that
the blessed Virgin was truly and properly the Mother of our Saviour. And so is she frequently
styled the Mother of Jesus in the language of the Evangelists, and by Elizabeth particularly
the ‘Mother of her Lord,’ as also by the general consent of the Church (because he which
was so born of her was God,) the Deipara; which being a compound title begun in the Greek
Church, was resolved into its parts by the Latins and so the Virgin was plainly named the
Mother of God.”</p>
<p>Pearson is mistaken in supposing that the resolution of the compound Theotocos into
μήτηρ τοῦ Θεοῦ was unknown to the early Greek writers. Dionysius expressly calls Mary
<note type="footnote">255 Pearson, An Expos. of the Creed, Art. III., n. 36.</note>

<pb n="425"/>
ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου (Contr. Paul. Samos., Quæst. viij.); and among the Latins Mater Dei
and Dei Genetrix were (as Pearson himself confesses in note 37) used before the time of St.
Leo I. It is not an open question whether Mater Dei, Dei Genetrix, Deipara, μήτηρ τοῦ Θεοῦ
are proper equivalents for Θεοτόκος. This point has been settled by the unvarying use of
the whole Church of God throughout all the ages from that day to this, but there is, or at
least some persons have thought that there was, some question as to how Theotocos should
be translated into English.</p>
<p>Throughout this volume I have translated it “Mother of God,” and I propose giving my
reasons for considering this the only accurate translation of the word, both from a lexicographical
and from a theological point of view.</p>
<p>(a) It is evident that the word is a composite formed of Θεός = God, and τίκτειν = to
be the mother of a child. Now I have translated the verbal part “to be the mother of a child”
because “to bear” in English does not necessarily carry the full meaning of the Greek word,
which (as Bp. Pearson has well remarked in the passage cited above) includes “conception,
nutrition, and parturition.” It has been suggested that “God-bearer” is an exact translation.
To this I object, that in the first place it is not English; and in the second that it would be an
equally and, to my mind, more accurate translation of Θεοφόρος than of Θεοτόκος.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is that it be rendered “the bringer forth of God.” Again I object
that, from a rhetorical standpoint, the expression is very open to criticism; and from a lexicographical
point of view it is entirely inadequate, for while indeed the parturition does
necessarily involve in the course of nature the previous conception and nutrition, it certainly
does not express it.</p>
<p>Now the word Mother does necessarily express all three of these when used in relation
to her child. The reader will remember that the question I am discussing is not whether
Mary can properly be called the Mother of God; this Nestorius denied and many in ancient
and modern times have been found to agree with him. The question I am considering is
what the Greek word Theotocos means in English. I do not think anyone would hesitate
to translate Nestorius’s Christotocos by “Mother of Christ” and surely the expressions are
identical from a lexicographical point of view.</p>
<p>Liddell and Scott in their Lexicon insert the word θεοτόκος as an adjective and translate
“bearing God” and add: “especially ἡ Θεοτόκος, Mother of God, of the Virgin, Eccl.”</p>
<p>(b) It only remains to consider whether there is from a theological point of view any
objection to the translation, “Mother of God.” It is true that some persons have thought
that such a rendering implied that the Godhead has its origin in Mary, but this was the very
objection which Nestorius and his followers urged against the word Theotocos, and this
being the case, it constitutes a strong argument in favour of the accuracy of the rendering.
Of course the answer to the objection in each case is the same, it is not of the Godhead that
Mary is the Mother, but of the Incarnate Son, who is God. “Mother” expresses exactly the

<pb n="426"/>
relation to the incarnate Son which St. Cyril, the Council of Ephesus, and all succeeding,
not to say also preceding, ages of Catholics, rightly or wrongly, ascribe to Mary. All that
every child derives from its Mother that God the Son derived from Mary, and this without
the co-operation of any man, but by the direct operation of the Holy Ghost, so that in a
fuller, truer, and more perfect sense, Mary is the Mother of God the Son in his incarnation,
than any other earthly mother is of her son.</p>
<p>I therefore consider it certain that no scholar who can and will divest himself of theological
bias, can doubt that “Mother of God” is the most accurate translation of the term
Theotocos.</p>

<p>(Hist. of the Counc., Vol. III., p. 7.)</p>
<p>Theodore <del>of Mopsuestia, and in this he was followed by Nestorius,</del> (and here is his
fundamental error,) not merely maintained the existence of two natures in Christ, but of
two persons, as, he says himself, no subsistence can be thought of as perfect without personality.
As however, he did not ignore the fact that the consciousness of the Church rejected
such a double personality in Christ, he endeavoured to get rid of the difficulty, and he repeatedly
says expressly: “The two natures united together make only one Person, as man
and wife are only one flesh.…If we consider the natures in their distinction, we should define
the nature of the Logos as perfect and complete, and so also his Person, and again the nature
and the person of the man as perfect and complete. If, on the other hand, we have regard
to the union (συνάφεια), we say it is one Person.” The very illustration of the union of man
and wife shows that Theodore did not suppose a true union of the two natures in Christ,
but that his notion was rather that of an external connection of the two. The expression
συνάφεια, moreover, which he selected here instead of the term ἕνωσιν, which he elsewhere
employs, being derived from συνάπτω [to join together], expresses only an external connection,
a fixing together, and is therefore expressly rejected in later times by the doctors of the
Church. And again, Theodore designates a merely external connection also in the phrase
already quoted, to the effect that “the Logos dwells in the man assumed as in a temple.” As
a temple and the statue set up within it are one whole merely in outward appearance, so the

<p>If any one assigns the expressions of the Gospels and Apostolic letters, which refer to
the two natures of Christ, to one only of those natures, and even ascribes suffering to the
divine Word, both in the flesh and in the Godhead; let him be anathema.</p>
<p>St. Cyril.</p>
<p>(Apol. contra Orientales.)</p>
<p>For we neither teach the division of the hypostases after the union, nor do we say that
the nature of the Deity needs increase and growth; but this rather we hold, that by way of
an economical appropriation (κατ᾽ οἰκείωσιν οἰκονομικὴν), he made his own the properties
of the flesh, as having become flesh.</p>
<p>(Quod unus est Christus.)</p>
<p>For the wise Evangelist, introducing the Word as become flesh, shows him economically
submitting himself to his own flesh and going through the laws of his own nature. But it
belongs to humanity to increase in stature and in wisdom, and, I might add, in grace, intelligence
keeping pace with the measure of the body, and differing according to age. For it
was not impossible for the Word born of the Father to have raised the body united to himself
to its full height from the very swaddling-clothes. I would say also, that in the babe a wonderful
wisdom might easily have appeared. But that would have approached the thaumaturgical,
and would have been incongruous to the laws of the economy. For the mystery was
accomplished noiselessly. Therefore he economically allowed the measures of humanity to
have power over himself.</p>
<p>A. B. Bruce.</p>
<p>(The Humiliation of Christ. Appendix to Lect. II.)</p>

<pb n="431"/>
<p>The accommodation to the laws of the economy, according to this passage, consisted
in this—in stature, real growth; in wisdom, apparent growth. The wonderful wisdom was
there from the first, but it was not allowed to appear (ἐκφῆναι), to avoid an aspect of monstrosity.</p>
<p>St. Cyril.</p>
<p>(Adversus Nestorium.)</p>
<p>Therefore there would have been shown to all an unwonted and strange thing, if, being
yet an infant, he had made a demonstration of his wisdom worthy of God; but expanding
it gradually and in proportion to the age of the body, and (in this gradual manner) making
it manifest to all, he might be said to increase (in wisdom) very appropriately.</p>
<p>(Ad Reginas de recta fide, Orat. II., cap. xvi.)</p>
<p>“But the boy increased and waxed strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the
grace of God was upon him.” And again: “Jesus increased in stature and wisdom, and in
favour with God and men.” In affirming our Lord Jesus Christ to be one, and assigning to
him both divine and human properties, we truly assert that it was congruous to the measures
of the kenosis, on the one hand, that he should receive bodily increase and grow strong, the
parts of the body gradually attaining their full development; and, on the other hand, that
he should seem to be filled with wisdom, in so far as the manifestation of the wisdom
dwelling within him proceeded, as by addition, most congruously to the stature of the body;
and this, as I said, agreed with the economy of the Incarnation, and the measures of the
state of humiliation.</p>
<p>(Apol. contra Theod., ad Anath. iv.)</p>
<p>And if he is one and the same in virtue of the true unity of natures, and is not one and
another (two persons) disjunctively and partitively, to him will belong both to know and to
seem not to know. Therefore he knows on the divine side as the Wisdom of the Father.
But since he subjected himself to the measure of humanity, he economically appropriates
this also with the rest, although, as I said a little ago, being ignorant of nothing, but knowing
all things with the Father.</p>

<p>If anyone shall dare to say that the Christ is a Theophorus [that is, God-bearing] man

<p>V.</p>
<p>If any one ventures to say that, even after the assumption of human nature, there is only
one Son of God, namely, he who is so in nature (naturaliter filius = Logos), while he (since
the assumption of the flesh) is certainly Emmanuel; let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Petavius.</p>
<p>It is manifest that this anathematism is directed against the blasphemy of Nestorius, by
which he said that Christ was in this sense Emmanuel, that a man was united and associated
with God, just as God had been said to have been with the Prophets and other holy men,
and to have had his abode in them; so that they were properly styled Θεοφόροι, because, as
it were, they carried God about with them; but there was no one made of the two. But he
held that our Lord as man was bound and united with God only by a communion of dignity.</p>
<p>Nestorius <del>in his Counter Anathematism</del> displays the hidden meaning of his heresy,
when he says, that the Son of God is not one after the assumption of the humanity; for he
who denied that he was one, no doubt thought that he was two.</p>
<p>Theodoret in his criticism of this Anathematism remarks that many of the Ancients,
including St. Basil had used this very word, Θεοφόρος, for the Lord; but the objection has
no real foundation, for the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of such a word must be determined by
the context in which it is used, and also by the known opinions of him that uses it. Expressions
which are in a loose sense orthodox and quite excusable before a heresy arises, may
become afterwards the very distinctive marks and shibboleths of error. Petavius has pointed
out how far from orthodox many of the earliest Christian writers were, at least verbally, and
Bp. Bull defended them by the same line of argument I have just used and which Petavius
himself employs in this very connection.</p>

has promised to raise it again in the words: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will

<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>This <del>statement of Nestorius’s that any should call “another than Christ the Word”</del> has
no reference to Cyril; but is a hyper-Nestorianism, which Nestorius here rejects. This​ <del>that
“the form of a servant is without beginning and uncreated”</del> was asserted by some Apollinarists;
and Nestorius accused St. Cyril of Apollinarianism.</p>
<p>Petavius.</p>
<p>As Nestorius believed that in Christ there were two distinct entities (re ipsa duos) that
is to say two persons joined together; it was natural that he should hold that the Word was
the God and Lord of the other, that is of the man. Cyril contradicts this, and since he taught
that there was, not two, but one of two natures, that is one person or suppositum, therefore
he denied that the Word was the God or Lord of the man; since no one should be called the Lord of himself.</p>
<p>Theodoret in his answer shuffles as usual, and points out that Christ is styled a servant
by the Prophet Isaiah, because of the form of a servant which he had received. But to this
Cyril answers; that although Christ, inasmuch as he was man, is called the servant of the
Father, as of a person distinct from himself; yet he denies that the same person can be his
own lord or servant, lest a separation of the person be introduced.</p>

<p>When the blessed Gabriel announced to the holy Virgin the generation of the only-begotten
Son of God according to the flesh, he said, “Thou shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call
his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.” But he was named also Christ,
because that according to his human nature he was anointed with us, according to the words
of the Psalmist: “Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity: therefore God, even
thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” For although he
was the giver of the Holy Spirit, neither did he give it by measure to them that were worthy
(for he was full of the Holy Ghost, and of his fulness have we all received, as it is written),
nevertheless as he is man he was called anointed economically, the Holy Spirit resting upon
him spiritually (νοητῶς) and not after the manner of men, in order that he might abide in
us, although he had been driven forth from us in the beginning by Adam’s fall. He therefore
the only begotten Word of God made flesh was called Christ. And since he possessed as his
own the power proper to God, he wrought his wonders. Whosoever therefore shall say that

this is nefarious and far removed from the mind of Cyril. Since to such an extent only the
human nature of Christ is one suppositum with the divine, that he declares that each is the
object of one and an undivided adoration; lest if a double and dissimilar cultus be attributed

expelling demons; let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Petavius.</p>
<p>The scope of this anathematism is to shew that the Word of God, when he assumed
flesh remaining what he was, and lacking nothing which the Father possessed except only
paternity, had as his own the Holy Spirit which is from him and substantially abides in him.
From this it follows that through him, as through a power and strength which was his own,
and not one alien or adventitious, he wrought his wonders and cast forth devils, but he did
not receive that Holy Spirit and his power as formerly the Prophets had done, or as afterwards
his disciples did, as a kind of gift (beneficii loco).</p>
<p>The Orientals objected that St. Cyril here contradicts himself, for here he says that Christ
did not work his wonders by the Holy Ghost and in another place he frankly confesses that
he did so work them. But the whole point is what is intended by working through the Holy
Ghost. For the Apostles worked miracles through the Holy Ghost but as by a power external
to themselves, but not so Christ. When Christ worked wonders through the Holy Ghost,
he was working through a power which was his own, viz.: the Third Person of the Holy
Trinity; from whom he never was and never could be separated, ever abiding with him and
the Eternal Father in the Divine Unity.</p>
<p>The Westerns have always pointed to this anathematism as shewing that St. Cyril recognized
the eternal relation of the Holy Spirit as being from the Son.</p>

<head>Excursus on How Our Lord Worked Miracles.</head>
<p>In view of the fact that many are now presenting as if something newly discovered, and
as the latest results of biblical study, the interpretations of the early heretics with regard to
our Lord’s powers and to his relation to the Holy Ghost, I have here set down in full
Theodoret’s Counter-statement to the faith accepted by the Ecumenical Councils of the Church.</p>
<p>Theodoret.</p>
<p>(Counter Statement to Anath. IX. of Cyril.)</p>
<p>Here he has plainly had the hardihood to anathematize not only those who at the present
time hold pious opinions, but also those who were in former days heralds of truth; aye even
the writers of the divine Gospels, the band of the holy Apostles, and, in addition to these,
Gabriel the archangel. For he indeed it was who first, even before the conception, announced
the birth of the Christ according to the flesh; saying in reply to Mary when she asked, How
shall this be, seeing I know not a man? “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing that shall be born of
thee shall be called the Son of God.” And to Joseph he said, “Fear not to take unto thee
Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.” And the Evangelist
says, “When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph…she was found with child of the
Holy Ghost.” And the Lord himself when he had come into the synagogue of the Jews and
had taken the prophet Isaiah, after reading the passage in which he says, “The Spirit of the
Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me” and so on, added, “This day is this scripture
fulfilled in your ears.” And the blessed Peter in his sermon to the Jews said, “God anointed
Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost.” And Isaiah many ages before had predicted “There
shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots; and
the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the
spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord”; and again,
“Behold my servant whom I uphold, my beloved in whom my soul delighteth. I will put
my Spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.” This testimony the
Evangelist too has inserted in his own writings. And the Lord himself in the Gospels says
to the Jews, “If I with the Spirit of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come
upon you.” And John says, “He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me,
Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.” So this exact examiner of the divine decrees has not
only anathematized prophets, apostles, and even the archangel Gabriel, but has suffered his
blasphemy to reach even the Saviour of the world himself. For we have shewn that the Lord
himself after reading the passage “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed

<pb n="439"/>
me,” said to the Jews, “This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.” And to those who
said that he was casting out devils by Beelzebub he replied that he was casting them out by
the Spirit of God. But we maintain that it was not God the Word, of one substance and coeternal
with the Father, that was formed by the Holy Ghost and anointed, but the human
nature which was assumed by him at the end of days. We shall confess that the Spirit of the
Son was his own if he spoke of it as of the same nature and proceeding from the Father, and
shall accept the expression as consistent with true piety. But if he speaks of the Spirit as
being of the Son, or as having its origin through the Son we shall reject this statement as
blasphemous and impious. For we believe the Lord when he says, “The spirit which proceedeth
from the Father”; and likewise the very divine Paul saying, “We have received not the
spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God.”</p>
<p>In the foregoing will be found the very same arguments used and the same texts cited
against the Catholic faith as are urged and cited by the Rev. A. J. Mason, The Conditions of
Our Lord’s Life on Earth, and by several other recent writers.</p>

the sacrifice between him who united <del>the Word</del> and him who was united <del>the manhood</del>
referring it to a common sonship, that is, not giving to God that which is God’s, and to man
that which is man’s; let him be anathema.</p>
<p>St. Cyril.</p>
<p>(Declaratio decima.)</p>
<p>But I do not know how those who think otherwise contend that the very Word of God
made man, was not the apostle and high-priest of our profession, but a man different from
him; who was born of the holy Virgin, was called our apostle and high-priest, and came to
this gradually; and that not only for us did he offer himself a sacrifice to God and the Father,
but also for himself. A statement which is wholly contrary to the right and undefiled faith,
for he did no sin, but was superior to fault and altogether free from sin, and needed no sacrifice
for himself. Since those who think differently were again unreasonably thinking of
two sons, this anathematism became necessary that their impiety might appear.</p>

<p>Whosoever shall not confess that the flesh of the Lord giveth life and that it pertains to
the Word of God the Father as his very own, but shall pretend that it belongs to another
person who is united to him [i.e., the Word] only according to honour, and who has served
as a dwelling for the divinity; and shall not rather confess, as we say, that that flesh giveth
life because it is that of the Word who giveth life to all: let him be anathema.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Nestorius.</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>If any one maintains that the flesh which is united with God the Word is by the power
of its own nature life-giving, whereas the Lord himself says, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth;
the flesh profiteth nothing” (St. John vi. 61), let him be anathema. <del>He adds, “God is a
Spirit” (St. John iv. 24). If, then, any one maintains that God the Logos has in a carnal
manner, in his substance, become flesh, and persists in this with reference to the Lord Christ;
who himself after his resurrection said to his disciples, “Handle me and see; for a spirit hath
not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having” (St. Luke xxiv. 39); let him be anathema.</del></p>

<p>St. Cyril.</p>
<p>(Declaratio undecima.)</p>
<p>We perform in the churches the holy, lifegiving, and unbloody sacrifice; the body, as
also the precious blood, which is exhibited we believe not to be that of a common man and
of any one like unto us, but receiving it rather as his own body and as the blood of the Word
which gives all things life. For common flesh cannot give life. And this our Saviour himself
testified when he said: “The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that giveth life.” For
since the flesh became the very own of the Word, therefore we understand that it is lifegiving,
as the Saviour himself said: “As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so
he that eateth me shall live by me.” Since therefore Nestorius and those who think with him
rashly dissolve the power of this mystery; therefore it was convenient that this anathematism
should be put forth.</p>

<head>XII.</head>
<p>Whosoever shall not recognize that the Word of God suffered in the flesh, that he was
crucified in the flesh, and that likewise in that same flesh he tasted death and that he is become
the first-begotten of the dead, for, as he is God, he is the life and it is he that giveth life: let
him be anathema.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Nestorius.</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>If any one, in confessing the sufferings of the flesh, ascribes these also to the Word of
God as to the flesh in which he appeared, and thus does not distinguish the dignity of the
natures; let him be anathema.</p>
<p>St. Cyril.</p>
<p>(Adv. Orientales, ad XII. Quoting Athanasius.)</p>
<p>For if the body is of another, to him also must the sufferings be ascribed. But if the flesh
is the Word’s (for “The Word was made flesh”) it is necessary that the sufferings of the flesh
be called his also whose is the flesh. But whose are the sufferings, such especially as condemnation,
flagellation, thirst, the cross, death, and other such like infirmities of the body, his
also is the merit and the grace. Therefore rightly and properly to none other are these sufferings
attributed than to the Lord, as also the grace is from him; and we shall not be guilty
of idolatry, but be the true worshippers of God, for we invoke him who is no creature nor
any common man, but the natural and true Son of God, made man, and yet the same Lord
and God and Saviour.</p>
<p>As I think, these quotations will suffice to the learned for the proof of the propositions
advanced, the Divine Law plainly saying that “In the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word shall be established.” But if after this any one would still seem to be contentious, we
would say to him: “Go thine own way. We however shall follow the divine Scriptures and
the faith of the Holy Fathers.”</p>
<p>The student should read at full length all Cyril’s defence of his anathematisms, also his
answers to the criticisms of Theodoret, and to those of the Orientals, all of which will be
found in his works, and in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., 811 et seqq.</p>

<p><del>No action is recorded in the Acts as having been taken. A verbal report was made by
certain who had seen Nestorius during the past three days, that they were hopeless of any repentance
on his part. On the motion of Flavian, bishop of Philippi, a number of passages from
the Fathers were read; and after that some selections from the writings of Nestorius. A letter
from Capreolus, Archbishop of Carthage, was next read, excusing his absence; after the reading
of the letter, which makes no direct reference to Nestorius whatever, but prays the Synod to
see to it that no novelties be tolerated, the Acts proceed. (Col. 534).</del></p>
<p>Cyril, the bishop of the Church of Alexandria, said: As this letter of the most reverend
and pious Capreolus, bishop of Carthage, which has been read, contains a most lucid expression
of opinion, let it be inserted in the Acts. For it wishes that the ancient dogmas of the
faith should be confirmed, and that novelties, absurdly conceived and impiously brought
forth, should be reprobated and proscribed.</p>
<p>All the bishops at the same time cried out: These are the sentiments (φωναί) of all of
us, these are the things we all say—the accomplishment of this is the desire of us all.</p>

<head>Decree of the Council Against Nestorius.</head>
<p>(Found in all the Concilia in Greek with Latin Versions.)</p>
<p>As, in addition to other things, the impious Nestorius has not obeyed our citation, and
did not receive the holy bishops who were sent by us to him, we were compelled to examine
his ungodly doctrines. We discovered that he had held and published impious doctrines in
his letters and treatises, as well as in discourses which he delivered in this city, and which
have been testified to. Compelled thereto by the canons and by the letter (ἀναγκαίως
κατεπειχθέντες ἀπό τε τῶν κανόνων, καὶ ἐκ τὴς ἐπιστολῆς, κ.τ.λ.) of our most holy father
and fellow-servant Coelestine, the Roman bishop, we have come, with many tears, to this
sorrowful sentence against him, namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he has blasphemed,
decrees by the holy Synod that Nestorius be excluded from the episcopal dignity, and from
all priestly communion.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>The words for which I have given the original Greek, are not mentioned by Canon
Bright in his Article on St. Cyril in Smith and Wace’s Dictionary of Christian Biography;
nor by Ffoulkes in his article on the Council of Ephesus in Smith and Cheetham’s Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities. They do not appear in Canon Robertson’s History of the Church.
And strangest of all, Dean Milman cites the sentence in English in the text and in Greek in
a note but in each case omits all mention of the letter of the Pope, marking however in the
Greek that there is an omission. (Lat. Chr., Bk. II., Chap. III.)257 I also note that the translation
in the English edition of Hefele’s History of the Councils (Vol. III., p. 51) is misleading
and inaccurate, “Urged by the canons, and in accordance with the letter etc.” The participle
by itself might mean nothing more than “urged” (vide Liddell and Scott on this verb and
also ἐπείγω) but the adverb which precedes it, ἀναγκαίως , certainly is sufficient to necessitate
the coacti of the old Latin version which I have followed, translating “compelled
thereto.” It will also be noticed that while the prepositions used with regard to the “canons”
and the “letter” are different, yet that their grammatical relation to the verb is identical is
shewn by the τε—καὶ, which proves the translation cited above to be utterly incorrect.</p>
<p>Hefele for the “canons” refers to canon number lxxiv. of the Apostolic Canons; which
orders an absent bishop to be summoned thrice before sentence be given against him.</p>
<note type="footnote">257 Complaint of all this has very justly been made recently by the Rev. Luke Rivington, a Roman Catholic
writer, in his work The Primitive Church and the See of Peter, p. 336.</note>

The most pious and God-beloved bishops, Arcadius and Projectus, as also the most
beloved-of-God Philip, a presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See, then entered and took
their seats.258</p>
<p>Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said: We bless the holy and adorable
Trinity that our lowliness has been deemed worthy to attend your holy Synod. For a long
time ago (πάλαι) our most holy and blessed pope Coelestine, bishop of the Apostolic See,
through his letters to that holy and most pious man Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, gave judgment
concerning the present cause and affair (ὥρισεν) which letters have been shown to
your holy assembly. And now again for the corroboration of the Catholic (καθολικῆς) faith,
he has sent through us letters to all your holinesses, which you will bid (κελούσατε) to be
read with becoming reverence (πρεπόντως) and to be entered on the ecclesiastical minutes.</p>
<p>Arcadius, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said: May it please your blessedness
to give order that the letters of the holy and ever-to-be-mentioned-with-veneration Pope
Coelestine, bishop of the Apostolic See, which have been brought by us, be read, from which
your reverence will be able to see what care he has for all the Churches.</p>
<p>Projectus, a bishop and legate of the Roman Church said, May it please, etc. <del>The same
as Arcadius had said verbatim!</del></p>
<p>And afterwards the most holy and beloved-of-God Cyril, bishop of the Church of Alexandria,
spoke as is next in order contained; Siricius, notary of the holy Catholic (καθολικῆς)
Church of Rome read it.</p>
<p>Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria said: Let the letter received from the most holy and altogether
most blessed Coelestine, bishop of the Apostolic See of Rome be read to the holy
Synod with fitting honour.</p>
<p>Siricius, notary of the holy Catholic (καθολικῆς) Church of the city of Rome read it.</p>
<p>And after it was read in Latin, Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem said: Let the writings
of the most holy and blessed bishop of great Rome which have just been read, be entered
on the minutes.</p>
<note type="footnote">258 It should be noted that in the Acts Cyril is described as having “the place of the most holy and sacred
Archbishop of the Roman Church Coelestine.” Hefele says “that Cyril presided as Pope’s vicar is asserted also
by Mennas of Constantinople and other Greek bishops in their letter to Pope Vigilius, in Mansi, t. ix., p. 62;
Hardouin, t. iii., p. 10.” (Hef., Hist. of the Councils, Vol. III., p. 46, n. 4.)</note>

<pb n="446"/>
<p>And all the most reverend bishops prayed that the letter might be translated and read.</p>
<p>Philip, the presbyter of the Apostolic See and Legate said: The custom has been sufficiently
complied with, that the writings of the Apostolic See should first be read in Latin.259
But now since your holiness has demanded that they be read in Greek also, it is necessary
that your holiness’s desire should be satisfied; We have taken care that this be done, and
that the Latin be turned into Greek. Give order therefore that it be received and read in
your holy hearing.</p>
<p>Arcadius and Projectus, bishops and legates said, As your blessedness ordered that the
writings which we brought should be brought to the knowledge of all, for of our holy brethren
bishops there are not a few who do not understand Latin, therefore the letter has been
translated into Greek and if you so command let it be read.</p>
<p>Flavian, the bishop of Philippi said: Let the translation of the letter of the most holy

<p>Peter, the presbyter of Alexandria and primicerius of the notaries read as follows:</p>

<head>The Letter of Pope Coelestine to the Synod of Ephesus.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 613. Also Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. L, col. 505.260)</p>
<p>Coelestine the bishop to the holy Synod assembled at Ephesus, brethren beloved and
most longed for, greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>A Synod of priests gives witness to the presence of the Holy Spirit. For true is that which
we read, since the Truth cannot lie, to wit, the promise of the Gospel; “Where two or three
are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” And since this is so, if
the Holy Spirit is not absent from so small a number how much more may we believe he is
present when so great a multitude of holy ones are assembled together! Every council is
holy on account of a peculiar veneration which is its due; for in every such council the reverence
which should be paid to that most famous council of the Apostles of which we read
is to be had regard to. Never was the Master, whom they had received to preach, lacking to
this, but ever was present as Lord and Master; and never were those who taught deserted
by their teacher. For he that had sent them was their teacher; he who had commanded what
was to be taught, was their teacher; he who affirms that he himself is heard in his Apostles,
was their teacher. This duty of preaching has been entrusted to all the Lord’s priests in
common, for by right of inheritance we are bound to undertake this solicitude, whoever of
us preach the name of the Lord in divers lands in their stead for he said to them, “Go, teach
all nations.” You, dear brethren, should observe that we have received a general command:
for he wills that all of us should perform that office, which he thus entrusted in common to
all the Apostles. We must needs follow our predecessors. Let us all, then, undertake their
labours, since we are the successors in their honour. And we shew forth our diligence in
preaching the same doctrines that they taught, beside which, according to the admonition
of the Apostle, we are forbidden to add aught. For the office of keeping what is committed
to our trust is no less dignified than that of handing it down.</p>
<p>They sowed the seed of the faith. This shall be our care that the coming of our great
father of the family, to whom alone assuredly this fulness of the Apostles is assigned, may
find fruit uncorrupt and many fold. For the vase of election tells us that it is not sufficient
to plant and to water unless God gives the increase. We must strive therefore in common
<note type="footnote">260 This letter we know was originally written in Latin, and that it was translated into Greek and then read
afterwards in that language to the Council. There would seem to be no doubt that the Greek text we now find
in the Acts is that first translation, but whether the Latin is the original or whether it is a translation back again
from the Greek is not known, so far as I am aware. Certainly the Latin is of the most extraordinary character,
and suggests that it was the work of one not skilled in that tongue. The text in several places is manifestly corrupt
and the Greek and Latin do not always agree. If I may venture to express an opinion I should say that the Greek
was more lucid. Although in nineteen places Labbe considers the true reading uncertain.</note>

<pb n="448"/>
to keep the faith which has come down to us to-day, through the Apostolic Succession. For
we are expected to walk according to the Apostle. For now not our appearance (species)
but our faith is called in question. Spiritual weapons are those we must take, because the
war is one of minds, and the weapons are words; so shall we be strong in the faith of our
King. Now the Blessed Apostle Paul admonishes that all should remain in that place in
which he bid Timothy remain. The same place therefore, the same cause, lays upon us the
same duty. Let us now also do and study that which he then commanded him to do. And
let no one think otherwise, and let no one pay heed to over strange fables, as he himself
ordered. Let us be unanimous, thinking the same thing, for this is expedient: let us do
nothing out of contention, nothing out of vain glory: let us be in all things of one mind, of
one heart, when the faith which is one, is attacked. Let the whole body grieve and mourn
in common with us. He who is to judge the world is called into judgment; he who is to criticise
all, is himself made the object of criticism, he who redeemed us is made to suffer
calumny. Dear Brethren, gird ye with the armour of God. Ye know what helmet must
protect our head, what breast-plate our breast. For this is not the first time the ecclesiastical
camps have received you as their rulers. Let no one doubt that by the favour of the Lord
who maketh twain to be one, there will be peace, and that arms will be laid aside since the
very cause defends itself.</p>
<p>Let us look once again at these words of our Doctor, which he uses with express reference
to bishops, saying, “Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock, over which the Holy
Ghost has placed you as bishop, that ye rule the church of God, which he hath purchased
with his blood.”</p>
<p>We read that they who heard this at Ephesus, the same place at which your holiness is
come together, were called thence. To them therefore to whom this preaching of the faith
was known, to them also let your defence of the same faith also be known. Let us shew them
the constancy of our mind with that reverence which is due to matters of great importance;
which things peace has guarded for a long time with pious understanding.</p>
<p>Let there be announced by you what things have been preserved intact from the Apostles;
for the words of tyrannical opposition are never admitted against the King of Kings, nor
can the business of truth be oppressed by falsehood.</p>
<p>I exhort you, most blessed brethren, that love alone be regarded in which we ought to
remain, according to the voice of John the Apostle whose reliques we venerate in this city.
Let common prayer be offered to the Lord. For we can form some idea of what will be the
power of the divine presence at the united intercession of such a multitude of priests, by
considering how the very place was moved where, as we read, the Twelve made together
their supplication. And what was the purport of that prayer of the Apostles? It was that
they might receive grace to speak the word of God with confidence, and to act through its
power, both of which they received by the favour of Christ our God. And now what else is

<pb n="449"/>
to be asked for by your holy council, except that ye may speak the Word of the Lord with
confidence? What else than that he would give you grace to preserve that which he has
given you to preach? that being filled with the Holy Ghost, as it is written, ye may set forth
that one truth which the Spirit himself has taught you, although with divers voices.</p>
<p>Animated, in brief, by all these considerations (for, as the Apostle says: “I speak to them
that know the law, and I speak wisdom among them that are perfect”), stand fast by the
Catholic faith, and defend the peace of the Churches, for so it is said, both to those past,
present, and future, asking and preserving “those things which belong to the peace of Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>Out of our solicitude, we have sent our holy brethren and fellow priests, who are at one
with us and are most approved men, Arcedius, and Projectus, the bishops, and our presbyter,
Philip, that they may be present at what is done and may carry out what things have been
already decreed be us (quæ a nobis antea statuta sunt, exequantur).</p>
<p>To the performing of which we have no doubt that your holiness will assent when it is
seen that what has been decreed is for the security of the whole church. Given the viij of
the Ides of May, in the consulate of Bassus and Antiochus.</p>

exhorted your holiness (not as if teaching the ignorant, but as reminding them that know)
that those things which he had long ago defined, and now thought it right to remind you
of, ye might give command to be carried out to the uttermost, according to the canon of
the common faith, and according to the use of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Firmus, the bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia said: The Apostolic and holy see of the
most holy bishop Coelestine, hath previously given a decision and type (τύπον) in this
matter, through the writings which were sent to the most God beloved bishops, to wit to
Cyril of Alexandria, and to Juvenal of Jerusalem, and to Rufus of Thessalonica, and to the
holy churches, both of Constantinople and of Antioch. This we have also followed and

and thereupon having delayed no little time so that the day fixed by the emperor was
past; and since Nestorius although cited had not appeared) we carried into effect the type
(τύπον) having pronounced against him a canonical and apostolical judgment.</p>
<p>Arcadius the most reverend bishop and legate, said: Although our sailing was slow, and
contrary winds hindered us especially, so that we did not know whether we should arrive

order that there be laid before us what things were done in this holy Synod before our arrival;
in order that according to the opinion of our blessed pope and of this present holy assembly,
we likewise may ratify their determination.</p>
<p>Theodotus, the bishop of Ancyra said: The God of the whole world has made manifest
the justice of the judgment pronounced by the holy Synod by the writings of the most religious
bishop Coelestine, and by the coming of your holiness. For ye have made manifest
the zeal of the most holy and reverend bishop Coelestine, and his care for the pious faith.
And since very reasonably your reverence is desirous of learning what has been done from

<p>Juvenal the bishop of Jerusalem said to Arcadius and Projectus the most reverend
bishops, and to Philip the most reverend presbyter; Yesterday while this holy and great
synod was in session, when your holiness was present, you demanded after the reading of
the letter of the most holy and blessed bishop of Great Rome, Coelestine, that the minutes
made in the Acts with regard to the deposition of Nestorius the heretic should be read. And
thereupon the Synod ordered this to be done. Your holiness will be good enough to inform
us whether you have read them and understand their power.</p>
<p>Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said: From reading the Acts we have
found what things have been done in your holy synod with regard to Nestorius. We have
found from the minutes that all things have been decided in accordance with the canons
and with ecclesiastical discipline. And now also we seek from your honour, although it may
be useless, that what things have been read in your synod, the same should now again be
read to us also; so that we may follow the formula (τύπῳ) of the most holy pope Coelestine
(who committed this same care to us), and of your holiness also, and may be able to confirm
(βεβαιώσαι) the judgment.</p>

was done by the primicerius of the notaries.</del></p>
<p>Philip the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See said: There is no doubt, and in fact
it has been known in all ages, that the holy and most blessed Peter, prince (ἔξαρχος) and
head of the Apostles, pillar of the faith, and foundation (θεμέλιος) of the Catholic Church,
received the keys of the kingdom from our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour and Redeemer of
the human race, and that to him was given the power of loosing and binding sins: who
down even to to-day and forever both lives and judges in his successors. The holy and most
blessed pope Coelestine, according to due order, is his successor and holds his place, and us
he sent to supply his place in this holy synod, which the most humane and Christian Emperors
have commanded to assemble, bearing in mind and continually watching over the
Catholic faith. For they both have kept and are now keeping intact the apostolic doctrine
handed down to them from their most pious and humane grandfathers and fathers of holy
memory down to the present time, etc.</p>

that he is deprived of all episcopal dignity, and is an alien from the whole Church and from
the communion of all its priests.</p>
<p>Projectus, bishop and legate of the Roman Church said: Most clearly from the reading,
etc.<gap reason=" omitted"/>Moreover I also, by my authority as legate of the holy Apostolic See, define, being with my brethren an executor (ἐκβιβαστὴς) of the aforesaid sentence, that the beforenamed
Nestorius is an enemy of the truth, a corrupter of the faith, and as guilty of the things of
which he was accused, has been removed from the grade of Episcopal honour, and moreover
from the communion of all orthodox priests.</p>
<p>Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria said: The professions which have been made by Arcadius
and Projectus, the most holy and pious bishops, as also by Philip, the most religious presbyter
of the Roman Church, stand manifest to the holy Synod. For they have made their profession
in the place of the Apostolic See, and of the whole of the holy synod of the God-beloved and
most holy bishops of the West. Wherefore let those things which were defined by the most
holy Coelestine, the God-beloved bishop, be carried into effect, and the vote cast against
Nestorius the heretic, by the holy Synod, which met in the metropolis of Ephesus be agreed
to universally; for this purpose let there be added to the already prepared acts the proceedings
of yesterday and today, and let them be shewn to their holiness, so that by their subscription
according to custom, their canonical agreement with all of us may be manifest.</p>
<p>Arcadius the most reverend bishop and legate of the Roman Church, said: According
to the acts of this holy Synod, we necessarily confirm with our subscriptions their doctrines.</p>
<p>The Holy Synod said: Since Arcadius and Projectus the most reverend and most religious
bishops and legates and Philip, the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See, have said that
they are of the same mind with us, it only remains, that they redeem their promises and
confirm the acts with their signatures, and then let the minutes of the acts be shewn to them.</p>

<p>The holy and ecumenical Synod, gathered together in Ephesus by the decree of our most
religious Emperors, to the bishops, presbyters, deacons, and all the people in every province
and city:</p>
<p>When we had assembled, according to the religious decree <del>of the Emperors</del>, in the
Metropolis of Ephesus, certain persons, a little more than thirty in number, withdrew from
amongst us, having for the leader of their schism John, Bishop of Antioch. Their names are
as follows: first, the said John of Antioch in Syria, John of Damascus, Alexander of Apamea,
Alexander of Hierapolis, Himerius of Nicomedia, Fritilas of Heraclea, Helladius of Tarsus,
Maximin of Anazarbus, Theodore of Marcianopolis, Peter of Trajanopolis, Paul of Emissa,
Polychronius of Heracleopolis, Euthyrius of Tyana, Meletius of Neocæsarea, Theodoret of
Cyrus, Apringius of Chalcedon, Macarius of Laodicea Magna, Zosys of Esbus, Sallust of
Corycus in Cilicia, Hesychius of Castabala in Cilicia, Valentine of Mutloblaca, Eustathius
of Parnassus, Philip of Theodosia, and Daniel, and Dexianus, and Julian, and Cyril, and
Olympius, and Diogenes, Polius, Theophanes of Philadelphia, Trajan of Augusta, Aurelius
of Irenopolis, Mysæus of Aradus, Helladius of Ptolemais. These men, having no privilege
of ecclesiastical communion on the ground of a priestly authority, by which they could injure
or benefit any persons; since some of them had already been deposed; and since from their
refusing to join in our decree against Nestorius, it was manifestly evident to all men that
they were all promoting the opinions of Nestorius and Celestius; the Holy Synod, by one
common decree, deposed them from all ecclesiastical communion, and deprived them of
all their priestly power by which they might injure or profit any persons.</p>

<head>Canon I.</head>
<p>Whereas it is needful that they who were detained from the holy Synod and remained
in their own district or city, for any reason, ecclesiastical or personal, should not be ignorant
of the matters which were thereby decreed; we, therefore, notify your holiness and charity
that if any Metropolitan of a Province, forsaking the holy and Ecumenical Synod, has joined
the assembly of the apostates, or shall join the same hereafter; or, if he has adopted, or shall
hereafter adopt, the doctrines of Celestius, he has no power in any way to do anything in
opposition to the bishops of the province, since he is already cast forth from all ecclesiastical
communion and made incapable of exercising his ministry; but he shall himself be subject
in all things to those very bishops of the province and to the neighbouring orthodox metropolitans,
and shall be degraded from his episcopal rank.</p>

canon of the Holy Synod of Ephesus <del>and the same is true of this first canon. Ed.</del> “Clerics
who shall have consented to Celestine or Nestorius, should be deposed,” let him not read
“Celestine” with an “n,” but “Celestius” without the “n.” For Celestine was the holy and
orthodox Pope of Rome, Celestius was the heretic.</p>
<p>It is perfectly certain that this was no accident on the part of Aristenus, for in his commentary
on Canon V., he expressly says that “Celestine was Bishop of Rome” and goes on
to affirm that, “The Holy Synod decreed that they who embraced the opinions of Nestorius
and Celestine,” etc. What perhaps is equally astonishing is that Nicholas Hydruntinus, while
correcting the name, still is of opinion that Celestius was a pope of Rome and begins his
scholion with the title, περι Κελεστίνου καὶ Κελεστίου Παπῶν Ρώμης. Beveridge well points
out that this confusion is all the more remarkable as in the Kalendar of the Saints observed
at that very time by the Greeks, on the eighth day of April was kept the memory of “Celestine,
Pope of Rome, as a Saint and Champion against the Nestorian heretics.” (Bev., Annot, in
C. v.).</p>

<head>Excursus on the Conciliabulum of John of Antioch.</head>
<p>The assembly referred to in this canon is one held by John of Antioch who had delayed
his coming so as to hamper the meeting of the synod. John was a friend of Nestorius and
made many fruitless attempts to induce him to accept the orthodox faith. It will be noticed
that the conciliabulum was absolutely silent with respect to Nestorius and his doctrine and
contented itself with attacking St. Cyril and the orthodox Memnon, the bishop of Ephesus.
St. Cyril and his friends did indeed accuse the Antiochenes of being adherents of Nestorius,
and in a negative way they certainly were so, and were in open opposition to the defenders
of the orthodox faith; but, as Tillemont263 has well pointed out, they did not theologically
agree with the heresy of Nestorius, gladly accepted the orthodox watchword “Mother of
God,” and subsequently agreed to his deposition.</p>
<p>The first session of the Council of Ephesus had already taken place on June 22, and it
was only on June 26th or 27th, that John of Antioch arrived at last at Ephesus.</p>
<p>(Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. III., p. 55 et seqq.)</p>
<p>The Synod immediately sent a deputation to meet him, consisting of several bishops
and clerics, to show him proper respect, and at the same time to make him acquainted with
the deposition of Nestorius, so that he might not be drawn into any intercourse with him.
The soldiers who surrounded Archbishop John prevented the deputation from speaking to
him in the street; consequently they accompanied him to his abode, but were compelled to
wait here for several hours, exposed to the insults of the soldiers, and at last, when they had
discharged their commission, were driven home, ill-treated and beaten. Count Irenæus,
the friend of Nestorius, had suggested this treatment, and approved of it. The envoys immediately
informed the Synod of what had happened, and showed the wounds which they
had received, which called forth great indignation against John of Antioch. According to
the representation of Memnon, excommunication was for this reason pronounced against
him; but we shall see further on that this did not take place until afterwards, and it is clear
that Memnon, in his brief narrative, has passed over an intermediate portion—the threefold
invitation of John. In the meantime, Candidian had gone still further in his opposition to
the members of the synod, causing them to be annoyed and insulted by his soldiers, and
even cutting off their supply of food, while he provided Nestorius with a regular body-guard
of armed peasants. John of Antioch, immediately after his arrival, while still dusty from the
journey, and at the time when he was allowing the envoys of the synod to wait, held at his
town residence a Conciliabulum with his adherents, at which, first of all Count Candidian
related how Cyril and his friends, in spite of all warnings, and in opposition to the imperial
<note type="footnote">263 Tillemont, Mémoires, Tom. xiv.</note>

<pb n="457"/>
decrees, had held a session five days before, had contested his (the count’s) right to be
present, had dismissed the bishops sent by Nestorius, and had paid no attention to the letters
of others. Before he proceeded further, John of Antioch requested that the Emperor’s edict
of convocation should be read, whereupon Candidian went on with his account of what
had taken place, and in answer to a fresh question of John’s declared that Nestorius had
been condemned unheard. John found this quite in keeping with the disposition of the
synod since, instead of receiving him and his companions in a friendly manner, they had
rushed upon them tumultuously (it was thus that he described what had happened). But
the holy Synod, which was now assembled, would decide what was proper with respect to
them. And this synod, of which John speaks in such grandiloquent terms, numbered only
forty-three members, including himself, while on the other side there were more than two
hundred.</p>
<p>John then proposed the question <del>as to</del> what was to be decided respecting Cyril and
his adherents; and several who were not particularly pronounced Nestorian bishops came
forward to relate how Cyril and Memnon of Ephesus had, from the beginning, maltreated
the Nestorians, had allowed them no church, and even on the festival of Pentecost had
permitted them to hold no service. Besides Memnon had sent his clerics into the residences
of the bishops, and had ordered them with threats to take part in his council. And in this
way he and Cyril had confused everything, so that their own heresies might not be examined.
Heresies, such as the Arian, the Apollinarian, and the Eunomian, were certainly contained
in the last letter of Cyril <del>to Nestorius, along with the anathematisms</del>. It was therefore
John’s duty to see to it that the heads of these heresies (Cyril and Memnon) should be suitably
punished for such grave offences, and that the bishops who had been misguided by them
should be subjected to ecclesiastical penalties.</p>
<p>To these impudent and false accusations John replied with hypocritical meekness “that
he had certainly wished that he should not be compelled to exclude from the Church any
one who had been received into the sacred priesthood, but diseased members must certainly
be cut off in order to save the whole body; and for this reason Cyril and Memnon deserved
to be deposed, because they had given occasion to disorders, and had acted in opposition
to the commands of the Emperors, and besides, were in the chapters mentioned <del>the anathematisms</del>
guilty of heresy. All who had been misled by them were to be excommunicated
until they confessed their error, anathematized the heretical propositions of Cyril, adhered
strictly to the creed of Nice, without any foreign addition, and joined the synod of John.”</p>
<p>The assembly approved of this proposal, and John then announced the sentence in the
following manner:—</p>
<p>“The holy Synod, assembled in Ephesus, by the grace of God and the command of the
pious Emperors, declares: We should indeed have wished to be able to hold a Synod in
peace, but because you held a separate assembly from a heretical, insolent, and obstinate

<pb n="458"/>
disposition, although we were already in the neighbourhood, and have filled both the city
and the holy Synod with confusion, in order to prevent the examination of your Apollinarian,
Arian, and Eunomian heresies, and have not waited for the arrival of the holy bishops of all
regions, and have also disregarded the warnings and admonitions of Candidian, therefore
shall you, Cyril of Alexandria, and you Memnon of this place, know that you are deposed
and dismissed from all sacerdotal functions, as the originators of the whole disorder, etc.
You others, who gave your consent, are excommunicated, until you acknowledge your fault
and reform, accept anew the Nicene faith <del>as if they had surrendered it!</del> without foreign
addition, anathematize the heretical propositions of Cyril, and in all things comply with the
command of the Emperors, who require a peaceful and more accurate consideration of the
dogma.”</p>
<p>This decree was subscribed by all the forty-three members of the Conciliabulum:</p>
<p>The Conciliabulum then, in very one-sided letters informed the Emperor, the imperial
ladies (the wife and sister of the Emperor Theodosius II.), the clergy, the senate, and the
people of Constantinople, of all that had taken place, and a little later once more required
the members of the genuine Synod, in writing, no longer to delay the time for repentance
and conversion, and to separate themselves from Cyril and Memnon, etc., otherwise they
would very soon be forced to lament their own folly.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening the Conciliabulum asked Count Candidian to take care that neither
Cyril nor Memnon, nor any one of their (excommunicated) adherents should hold divine
service on Sunday. Candidian now wished that no member of either synodal party should
officiate, but only the ordinary clergy of the city; but Memnon declared that he would in no
way submit to John and his synod, and Cyril and his adherents held divine service. All the
efforts of John to appoint by force another bishop of Ephesus in the place of Memnon were frustrated by the opposition of the orthodox inhabitants.</p>

<p>If any provincial bishops were not present at the holy Synod and have joined or attempted
to join the apostacy; or if, after subscribing the deposition of Nestorius, they went back into

<p>If any bishop assents to or favours Nestorius, let him be discharged.</p>
<p>It was not unnatural that when it was seen that the Imperial authority was in favour of
the Antiochene party that some of the clergy should have been weak enough to vacillate in
their course, the more so as the Conciliabulum was not either avowedly, nor really, a
Nestorian assembly, but one made up of those not sympathizing with Nestorius’s heresy,
yet friendly to the heretic himself, and disapproving of what they looked upon as the uncalledfor
harshness and precipitancy of Cyril’s course.</p>

<p>If any of the city or country clergy have been inhibited by Nestorius or his followers

who have already apostatized or shall hereafter apostatize.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>To whom Nestorius forbids the priesthood, he is most worthy; but whom he approves is
profane.</p>
<p>It would seem from this canon that any bishop who had become a member of the
Conciliabulum of John, was considered as eo ipso having lost all jurisdiction. Also it would
seem that the clergy were to disregard the inhibition of Nestorian prelates or at least these
inhibitions were by some one to be removed. This principle, if generally applied, would
seem to be somewhat revolutionary.</p>

<p>The words χῶρος (“place”), χώρα (“country”), and χωρίον (“district”), may be distinguished
as implying locality, extension, and limitation, respectively. The last word commonly
denotes either “an estate, a farm,” or “a fastness, a stronghold,” or (as a mathematical term)
“an area.” Here, as not unfrequently in later writers, it is “a region, a district,” but the same
fundamental idea is presumed. The relation of χῶρος to χωρίον is the same as that of
ἄργυρος, χρυσός to ἀργύριον, χρυσίον, the former being the metals themselves, the latter
the metals worked up into bullion or coins or plate or trinkets or images, e.g. Macar. Magn.

<head>Excursus on Pelagianism.</head>
<p>The only point which is material to the main object of this volume is that Pelagius and
his fellow heretic Celestius were condemned by the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus for their
heresy. On this point there can be no possible doubt. And further than this the Seventh
Council by ratifying the Canons of Trullo received the Canons of the African Code which
include those of the Carthaginian conciliar condemnations of the Pelagian heresy to which
the attention of the reader is particularly drawn. The condemnation of these heretics at
Ephesus is said to have been due chiefly to the energy of St. Augustine, assisted very materially
by a layman living in Constantinople by the name of Marius Mercator.</p>
<p>Pelagius and his heresy have a sad interest to us as he is said to have been born in Britain.
He was a monk and preached at Rome with great applause in the early years of the fifth
century. But in his extreme horror of Manichæism and Gnosticism he fell into the opposite
extreme; and from the hatred of the doctrine of the inherent evilness of humanity he fell
into the error of denying the necessity of grace.</p>
<p>Pelagius’s doctrines may be briefly stated thus. Adam’s sin injured only himself, so that
there is no such thing as original sin. Infants therefore are not born in sin and the children
of wrath, but are born innocent, and only need baptism so as to be knit into Christ, not “for
the remission of sins” as is declared in the creed. Further he taught that man could live
without committing any sin at all. And for this there was no need of grace; indeed grace
was not possible, according to his teaching. The only “grace,” which he would admit the
existence of, was what we may call external grace, e.g. the example of Christ, the teaching
of his ministers, and the like. Petavius265 indeed thinks that he allowed the activity of internal
grace to illumine the intellect, but this seems quite doubtful.</p>
<p>Pelagius’s writings have come down to us in a more or less—generally the latter—pure
form. There are fourteen books on the Epistles of St. Paul, also a letter to Demetrius and
his Libellus fidei ad Innocentium. In the writings of St. Augustine are found fragments of
Pelagius’s writings on free will.</p>
<p>It would be absurd to attempt in the limits possible to this volume to give any, even the
most sketchy, treatment of the doctrine involved in the Pelagian controversy: the reader
must be referred to the great theologians for this and to aid him I append a bibliographical
table on the subject.</p>

<p>As it is impossible to treat the theological question here, so too is it impossible to treat
the historical question. However I may remind the reader that Nestorius and his heresy
were defended by Theodore of Mopsuestia, and that he and Celestius were declared by Pope
Zosimus to be innocent in the year 417, a decision which was entirely disregarded by the
rest of the world, a Carthaginian Synod subsequently anathematizing him. Finally the Pope
retracted his former decision, and in 418 anathematized him and his fellow, and gave notice
of this in his “epistola tractoria” to the bishops. Eighteen Italian bishops, who had followed
the Pope in his former decision of a twelve month before, refused to change their minds at
his bidding now, and were accordingly deposed, among them Julian of Eclanum. After this
Pelagius and Celestius found a fitting harbour of refuge with Nestorius of Constantinople,
and so all three were condemned together by the council of Ephesus, he that denied the incarnation
of the Word, and they twain that denied the necessity of that incarnation and of
the grace purchased thereby.</p>

<p>If any layman shall resist the Synod, let him be excommunicated. But if it be a cleric let

<p>How courageous the passing of this canon was can only be justly appreciated by those
who are familiar with the weight of the imperial authority at that day in ecclesiastical matters
and who will remember that at the very time this canon was passed it was extremely difficult
to say whether the Emperor would support Cyril’s or John’s synod.</p>
<p>Observation of the Roman Editors (Ed: 1608).</p>
<p>In the Vatican books and in some others only these six canons are found; but in certain
texts there is added, under the name of Canon VII., the definition of the same holy Synod
put forth after the Presbyter Charisius had stated his case, and for Canon VIII. another decree
of the synod concerning the bishops of Cyprus.
Observation of Philip Labbe, S.J.P.
In the Collections of John Zonaras and of Theodore Balsamon, also in the “Code of the
Universal Church” which has John Tilius, Bishop of St. Brieuc and Christopher Justellus
for its editors, are found eight canons of the Ephesine council, to wit the six which are appended
to the foregoing epistle and two others: but it is altogether a subject of wonder that
in the Codex of Canons, made for the Roman Church by Dionysius Exiguus, none of these
canons are found at all. I suppose that the reason of this is that the Latins saw that they
were not decrees affecting the Universal Church, but that the Canons set forth by the Ephesine
fathers dealt merely with the peculiar and private matters of Nestorius and of his followers.</p>
<p>The Decree of the same holy Synod, pronounced after hearing the Exposition [of the
Faith] by the Three hundred and eighteen holy and blessed Fathers in the city of Nice, and
the impious formula composed by Theodore of Mopsuestia, and given to the same holy
Synod at Ephesus by the Presbyter Charisius, of Philadelphia:</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="466"/>
<head>Canon VII.</head>
<p>When these things had been read, the holy Synod decreed that it is unlawful for any
man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different (ἑτέραν) Faith as a rival to that
established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicæa.</p>
<p>But those who shall dare to compose a different faith, or to introduce or offer it to persons
desiring to turn to the acknowledgment of the truth, whether from Heathenism or from
Judaism, or from any heresy whatsoever, shall be deposed, if they be bishops or clergymen;
bishops from the episcopate and clergymen from the clergy; and if they be laymen, they
shall be anathematized.</p>
<p>And in like manner, if any, whether bishops, clergymen, or laymen, should be discovered
to hold or teach the doctrines contained in the Exposition introduced by the Presbyter
Charisius concerning the Incarnation of the Only-Begotten Son of God, or the abominable
and profane doctrines of Nestorius, which are subjoined, they shall be subjected to the sentence
of this holy and ecumenical Synod. So that, if it be a bishop, he shall be removed from
his bishopric and degraded; if it be a clergyman, he shall likewise be stricken from the clergy;
and if it be a layman, he shall be anathematized, as has been afore said.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</p>
<p>Any bishop who sets forth a faith other than that of Nice shall be an alien from the Church:
if a layman do so let him be cast out.</p>
<p>The heading is that found in the ordinary Greek texts. The canon itself is found verbatim
in the Acts—Actio VI. (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 689.)</p>
<p>Beveridge.</p>
<p>“When these things had been read.” Balsamon here makes an egregious mistake, for it
was not after the reading of the decree of this council and of the Nicene Creed, that this
canon was set forth, as Balsamon affirms; but after the reading of the libellum of Charisius,
and of the Nestorian Creed, as is abundantly evident from what we read in the Acts of the
council. From this it is clear that Balsamon had never seen the Acts of this council, or at
least had never carefully studied them, else he could not have written such a comment.</p>
<p><del>With regard to Charisius, Balsamon</del> makes another mistake. For not only did this
presbyter not follow the evil opinions of Nestorius, but as a matter of fact exhibited to the
synod his libellum written against Nestorius; in which so far from asserting that Nestorius
was orthodox, he distinctly calls him κακόδοξος.</p>

and often before and since, as well as by Pope Leo III., in answer to the ambassadors of
Charlemagne, that the prohibition of the Council of Ephesus to make, hold, or teach any
other faith than that of Nice forbade anyone, even a subsequent General Council, to add
anything to the creed. This interpretation seems to be shewn to be incorrect from the following
circumstances.</p>
<p>1. That the prohibition was passed by the Council immediately after it had heard
Charisius read his creed, which it had approved, and on the strength of which it had received
its author, and after the reading of a Nestorian creed which it condemned. From this it
seems clear that ἑτέραν must mean “different,” “contradictory,” and not “another” in the
sense of mere explanatory additions to the already existing creed.</p>
<p>(E. B. Pusey, On the Clause “and the Son,” p. 81.)</p>
<p>St. Cyril ought to understand the canon, which he probably himself framed, as presiding
over the Council of Ephesus, as Archbishop of Alexandria and representative of Celestine,
Bishop of Rome. His signature immediately succeeds the Canon. We can hardly think that
we understand it better than he who probably framed it, nay who presided over the Council
which passed it. He, however, explained that what was not against the Creed was not beside
it. The Orientals had proposed to him, as terms of communion, that he should “do away
with all he had written in epistles, tomes, or books, and agree with that only faith which had
been defined by our holy Fathers at Nice.” But, St. Cyril wrote back: “We all follow that
exposition of faith which was defined by the holy fathers in the city of Nice, sapping absolutely
nothing of the things contained in it. For they are all right and unexceptionable; and anything
curious, after it, is not safe. But what I have rightly written against the blasphemies of
Nestorius no words will persuade me to say that they were not done well:” and against the
imputation that he “had received an exposition of faith or new Creed, as dishonouring that
old and venerable Creed,” he says:</p>
<p>“Neither have we demanded of any an exposition of faith, nor have we received one
newly framed by others. For Divine Scripture suffices us, and the prudence of the holy
fathers, and the symbol of faith, framed perfectly as to all right doctrine. But since the most
holy Eastern Bishops differed from us as to that of Ephesus and were somehow suspected
of being entangled in the meshes of Nestorius, therefore they very wisely made a defence,
to free themselves from blame, and eager to satisfy the lovers of the blameless faith that they
were minded to have no share in his impiety; and the thing is far from all note of blame. If
<note type="footnote">267 Hefele, Conciliengesch. XLVIII., § 810.</note>

<pb n="469"/>
Nestorius himself, when we all held out to him that he ought to condemn his own dogmas
and choose the truth instead thereof, had made a written confession thereon, who would
say that he framed for us a new exposition of faith? Why then do they calumniate the assent
of the most holy Bishops of Phoenicia, calling it a new setting forth of the Creed, whereas
they made it for a good and necessary end, to defend themselves and soothe those who
thought that they followed the innovations of Nestorius? For the holy Ecumenical Synod
gathered at Ephesus provided, of necessity, that no other exposition of faith besides that
which existed, which the most blessed fathers, speaking in the Holy Ghost, defined, should
be brought into the Churches of God. But they who at one time, I know not how, differed
from it, and were suspected of not being right-minded, following the Apostolic and Evangelic
doctrines, how should they free themselves from this ill-report? by silence? or rather
by self-defence, and by manifesting the power of the faith which was in them? The divine
disciple wrote, ‘be ready always to give an answer to every one who asketh you an account
of the hope which is in you.’ But he who willeth to do this, innovates in nothing, nor doth
he frame any new exposition of faith, but rather maketh plain to those who ask him, what
faith he hath concerning Christ.”268</p>
<p>2. The fathers of the Council of Chalcedon, by their practice, are authoritative exponents
of the Canon of Ephesus. For they renewed the prohibition of the Council of Ephesus to
“adduce any other faith,” but, in “the faith” which is not to be set aside, they included not
only the Creeds of Nice and Constantinople, but the definitions at Ephesus and Chalcedon
itself. The statements of the faith were expanded, because fresh contradictions of the faith
had emerged. After directing that both Creeds should be read, the Council says, “This wise
and saving Symbol of Divine grace would have sufficed to the full knowledge and confirmation
of the faith; for it teaches thoroughly the perfect truth of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, and presents to those who receive it faithfully the Incarnation of the Lord.” Then,
having in detail shewn how both heresies were confuted by it, and having set forth the true
doctrine, they sum up.</p>
<p>“These things being framed by us with all accuracy and care on every side, the holy and
ecumenical Synod defines, that it shall be lawful for no one to produce or compose, or put
together, or hold, or teach others another faith, and those who venture, etc.” (as in the
Council of Ephesus).</p>
<p>The Council of Chalcedon enlarged greatly the terms although not the substance of the
faith contained in the Nicene Creed; and that, in view of the heresies, which had since arisen;
and yet renewed in terms the prohibition of the Canon of Ephesus and the penalties annexed
to its infringement. It shewed, then, in practice, that it did not hold the enlargement of the
things proposed as de fide to be prohibited, but only the producing of things contradictory
<note type="footnote">268 Cyril. Alex., Ep. xxxv., Ad Acac. Melit.</note>

<pb n="470"/>
to the faith once delivered to the saints. Its prohibition, moreover, to “hold” another faith
shews the more that they meant only to prohibit any contradictory statement of faith. For
if they had prohibited any additional statement not being a contradiction of its truth, then
(as Cardinal Julian acutely argued in the Council of Florence), any one would fall under its
anathema, who held (as all must) anything not expressed in set terms in the Nicene Creed;
such as that God is eternal or incomprehensible.</p>
<p>It may not be amiss to remember that the argument that πίστιν ἑτέραν forbids any addition
to the Creed or any further definition of the faith, was that urged by the heretics at
the Latrocinium, and the orthodox were there condemned on the ground that they had added
to the faith and laid themselves under the Anathema of Ephesus. How far this interpretation
was from being that of the Council of Chalcedon is evinced by the fact that it immediately
declared that St. Flavian and Bishop Eusebius had been unjustly deposed, and proceeded
to depose those who had deposed them. After stating these facts Dr. Pusey remarks, “Protestants
may reject consistently the authority of all councils; but on what grounds any who
accept their authority can insist on their own private interpretation of a canon of one
council against the authority of another General Council which rejected that interpretation,
I see not.”269</p>
<p>4. The Fifth Ecumenical Council, the Second of Constantinople, received both the
creeds of Nice and that of Constantinople, as well of the definitions of Ephesus and
Chalcedon, and yet at the end of the fourth Session we find in the acts that the fathers cried
out, with respect to the creed of Theodore of Mopsuestia: “This creed Satan composed.
Anathema to him that composed this creed! The First Council of Ephesus anathematized
this creed and its author. We know only one symbol of faith, that which the holy fathers of
Nice set forth and handed down. This also the three holy Synods handed down. Into this
we were baptized, and into this we baptize, etc., etc.”270 From this it is clearer than day that
these fathers looked upon the creed of Constantinople, with its additions, to be yet the same
creed as that of Nice.</p>
<p>(Le Quien, Diss. Dam., n. 37.)</p>
<p>In the Sixth Council also, no one objecting, Peter of Nicomedia, Theodore, and other
bishops, clerks, and monks, who had embraced the Monothelite heresy, openly recited a
Creed longer and fuller than the Nicene.</p>
<p>In the Seventh Synod also, another was read written by Theodore of Jerusalem: and
again, Basil of Ancyra, and the other Bishops, who had embraced the errors of the Iconoclasts,
again offered another, although the Canon of Ephesus pronounced, that “it should not be
<note type="footnote">269 E. B. Pusey, Lib. cit., p. 86.</note>
<note type="footnote">270 Labbe and Cossart, Tom. v., col. 455.</note>

<pb n="471"/>
lawful to offer to heretics, who wished to be converted to the Church, any other creed than
the Nicene.” In this same Synod, was read another profession of faith, which Tarasius had
sent to the Patriarchs of the Eastern sees. It contains the Nicene, or Constantinopolitan
Creed, variously enlarged and interpolated. But of the Holy Spirit it has specifically this:
“And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, which proceedeth from the Father
through the Son.” But since the Greeks at the Council of Florence said, that these were individual,
not common, formulæ of faith, here are others, which are plainly common and
solemn, which are contained in their own rituals. They do not baptize a Hebrew or a Jew,
until he have pronounced a profession of Christian Faith, altogether different from the
Creed of Constantinople, as may be seen in the Euchologion. In the consecration of a
Bishop, the Bishop elect is first bidden to recite the Creed of Constantinople; and then, as
if this did not suffice, a second and a third are demanded of him; of which the last contains
that aforesaid symbol, intermingled with various declarations. Nay, Photius himself is
pointed out to be the author of this interpolated symbol.271 I pass by other formulæ, which
the Greeks have framed for those who return to the Church from divers heresies or sects,
although the terms of the Canon of Ephesus are, that “it is unlawful to propose any other
faith to those who wish to be converted to the Church, from heathenism, or Judaism, or
any heresy whatever.”</p>
<p>The Judgment of the same Holy Synod, pronounced on the petition presented to it by
the Bishops of Cyprus:</p>

<head>Canon VIII.</head>
<p>Our brother bishop Rheginus, the beloved of God, and his fellow beloved of God bishops,
Zeno and Evagrius, of the Province of Cyprus, have reported to us an innovation which has
been introduced contrary to the ecclesiastical constitutions and the Canons of the Holy
Apostles, and which touches the liberties of all. Wherefore, since injuries affecting all require
the more attention, as they cause the greater damage, and particularly when they are transgressions
of an ancient custom; and since those excellent men, who have petitioned the
Synod, have told us in writing and by word of mouth that the Bishop of Antioch has in this
way held ordinations in Cyprus; therefore the Rulers of the holy churches in Cyprus shall
enjoy, without dispute or injury, according to the Canons of the blessed Fathers and ancient
custom, the right of performing for themselves the ordination of their excellent Bishops.
The same rule shall be observed in the other dioceses and provinces everywhere, so that
none of the God beloved Bishops shall assume control of any province which has not heretofore,
from the very beginning, been under his own hand or that of his predecessors. But
if any one has violently taken and subjected <del>a Province</del>, he shall give it up; lest the Canons
of the Fathers be transgressed; or the vanities of worldly honour be brought in under pretext
of sacred office; or we lose, without knowing it, little by little, the liberty which Our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Deliverer of all men, hath given us by his own Blood.</p>
<p>Wherefore, this holy and ecumenical Synod has decreed that in every province the rights
which heretofore, from the beginning, have belonged to it, shall be preserved to it, according
to the old prevailing custom, unchanged and uninjured: every Metropolitan having permission
to take, for his own security, a copy of these acts. And if any one shall bring forward
a rule contrary to what is here determined, this holy and ecumenical Synod unanimously
decrees that it shall be of no effect.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</p>
<p>Let the rights of each province be preserved pure and inviolate. No attempt to introduce
any form contrary to these shall be of any avail.</p>
<p>The caption is the one given in the ordinary Greek texts. The canon is found word for
word in the VII Session of the Council, with the heading, “A decree of the same holy Synod.”</p>
<p>I have followed in reading “the Canons of the Holy Apostles” the reading in Balsamon
and Zonaras, and that of Elias Ehingerus Augustanus (so says Beveridge) in his edition of
the Greek canons, a.d. 1614. But the Bodleian ms., and John of Antioch in his collection of

<pb n="473"/>
the Canons, and the Codex edited by Christopher Justellus read “of the Holy Fathers” instead
of “of the Holy Apostles.” Beveridge is of opinion that this is the truer reading, for while
no doubt the Ephesine Fathers had in mind the Apostolic Canons, yet they seem to have
more particularly referred in this place to the canons of Nice. And this seems to be intimated
in the libellum of the Bishops of Cyprus, who gave rise to this very decree, in which the
condemned practice is said to be “contrary to the Apostolic Canons and to the definitions
of the most holy Council of Nice.”</p>
<p>This canon Photius does not recognize, for in the Preface to his Nomocanon he distinctly
writes that there were but seven canons adopted by the Ephesine Synod, and in the first
chapter of the first title he cites the preceding canon as the seventh, that is the last. John of
Antioch likewise says that there are but seven canons of Ephesus, but reckons this present
canon as the seventh, from which Beveridge concludes that he rejects the Canon concerning
Charisius (vii).</p>
<p>Beveridge.</p>
<p>Concerning the present canon, of rather decree, the Bishop of Antioch, who had given
occasion to the six former canons, gave also occasion for the enacting of this, by arrogating
to himself the right of ordaining in the Island of Cyprus, in violation of former usage. After
the bishops of that island, who are mentioned in the canon, had presented their statements
(libellum) to the Synod, the present decree was set forth, in which warning was given that
no innovation should be tolerated in Ecclesiastical administration, whether in Cyprus or
elsewhere; but that in all Dioceses and Provinces their ancient rights and privileges should
be preserved.</p>

<head>The Letter of the Same Holy Synod of Ephesus, to the Sacred Synod
in Pamphylia Concerning Eustathius Who Had Been Their Metropolitan.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tome III., col. 806.)</p>
<p>Forasmuch as the divinely inspired Scripture says, “Do all things with advice,”272 it is
especially their duty who have had the priestly ministry allotted to them to examine with
all diligence whatever matters are to be transacted. For to those who will so spend their
lives, it comes to pass both that they are established in <del>the enjoyment of</del> an honest hope
concerning what belongs to them, and that they are borne along, as by a favouring breeze,
in things that they desire: so that, in truth, the saying <del>of the Scripture</del> has much reason
<del>to commend it</del>. But there are times when bitter and intolerable grief swoops down upon
the mind, and has the effect of cruelly beclouding it, so as to carry it away from the pursuit
of what is needful, and persuade it to consider that to be of service which is in its <del>very</del>
nature mischievous. Something of this kind we have seen endured by that most excellent
and most religious Bishop Eustathius. For it is in evidence that he has been ordained canonically;
but having been much disturbed, as he declares, by certain parties, and having entered
upon circumstances he had not foreseen, therefore, though fully able to repel the slanders
of his persecutors, he nevertheless, through an extraordinary inexperience of affairs, declined
to battle with the difficulties which beset him, and in some way that we know not set forth
an act of resignation. Yet it behooved him, when he had been once entrusted with the
priestly care, to cling to it with spiritual energy, and, as it were, to strip himself to strive
against the troubles and gladly to endure the sweat for which he had bargained. But inasmuch
as he proved himself to be deficient in practical capacity, having met with this misfortune
rather from inexperience than from cowardice and sloth, your holiness has of necessity ordained
our most excellent and most religious brother and fellow-bishop, Theodore, as the
overseer of the Church; for it was not reasonable that it should remain in widowhood, and
that the Saviour’s sheep should pass their time without a shepherd. But when he came to
us weeping, not contending with the aforenamed most religious Bishop Theodore for his
See or Church, but in the meantime seeking only for his rank and title as a bishop, we all
suffered with the old man in his grief, and considering his weeping as our own, we hastened
to discover whether the aforenamed <del>Eustathius</del>had been subjected to a legal deposition,
or whether, forsooth, he had been convicted on any of the absurd charges alleged by certain
parties who had poured forth idle gossip against his reputation. And indeed we learned
that nothing of such a kind had taken place, but rather that his resignation had been counted
<note type="footnote">272 Ecclesiasticus, xxxii., 19—“Do nothing without advice” (sine consilio nihil facias): The deutero-canonical
book of Ecclesiasticus is here by an Ecumenical Council styled “divinely-inspired Scripture.”</note>

against the said Eustathius instead of a [regular] indictment. Wherefore, we did by no means
blame your holiness for being compelled to ordain into his place the aforenamed most excellent
Bishop Theodore. But forasmuch as it was not seemly to contend much against the
unpractical character of the man, while it was rather necessary to have pity on the elder
who, at so advanced an age, was now so far away from the city which had given him birth,
and from the dwelling-places of his fathers, we have judicially pronounced and decreed
without any opposition, that he shall have both the name, and the rank, and the communion
of the episcopate. On this condition, however, only, that he shall not ordain, and that he
shall not take and minister to a Church of his own individual authority; but that [he shall
do so only] if taken as an assistant, or when appointed, if it should so chance, by a brother
and fellow-bishop, in accordance with the ordinance and the love which is in Christ. If,
however, ye shall determine anything more favourable towards him, either now or hereafter,
this also will be pleasing to the Holy Synod.</p>

<head>The Letter of the Synod to Pope Celestine.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 659; also in Migne, Pat. Lat. <del>reprinted
from Galland., Vett. Patr., Tom. ix.</del>, Tom. L., Ep. xx., col. 511.)</p>
<p>The relation which the holy council of Ephesus sent to Pope Celestine; in which are explained
what things were done in that Holy and Great Council.</p>
<p>The Holy Synod which by the grace of God was assembled at Ephesus the Metropolis
to the most holy and our fellow-minister Coelestine, health in the Lord.</p>
<p>The zeal of your holiness for piety, and your care for the right faith, so grateful and
highly pleasing to God the Saviour of us all, are worthy of all admiration. For it is your
custom in such great matters to make trial of all things, and the confirmation of the Churches
you have made your own care. But since it is right that all things which have taken place
should be brought to the knowledge of your holiness, we are writing of necessity <del>to inform
you</del> that, by the will of Christ the Saviour of us all, and in accordance with the orders of
the most pious and Christ-loving Emperors, we assembled together in the Metropolis of
the Ephesians from many and far scattered regions, being in all over two hundred bishops.
Then, in accordance with the decrees of the Christ-loving Emperors by whom we were assembled,
we fixed the date of the meeting of the holy Synod as the Feast of the Holy Pentecost,
all agreeing thereto, especially as it was contained in the letters of the Emperors that if anyone
did not arrive at the appointed time, he was absent with no good conscience, and was inexcusable
both before God and man. The most reverend John bishop of Antioch stopped
behind; not in singleness of heart, nor because the length of the journey made the impediment,
but hiding in his mind his plan and his thought (which was so displeasing to God,)
<del>a plan and thought</del> which he made clear when not long afterwards he arrived at Ephesus.</p>
<p>Therefore we put off the assemblin<del>of the council</del> after the appointed day of the Holy
Pentecost for sixteen whole days; in the meanwhile many of the bishops and clerics were
overtaken with illness, and much burdened by the expense, and some even died. A great
injury was thus being done to the great Synod, as your holiness easily perceives. For he used
perversely such long delay that many from much greater distances arrived before him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless after sixteen days had passed, certain of the bishops who were with him,
to wit, two Metropolitans, the one Alexander of Apamea, and the other Alexander of
Hierapolis, arrived before him. And when we complained of the tardy coming of the most
reverend bishop John, not once, but often, we were told, “He gave us command to announce
to your reverence, that if anything should happen to delay him, not to put off the Synod,
but to do what was right.” After having received this message,—and as it was manifest, as
well from his delay as from the announcements just made to us, that he refused to attend
the Council, whether out of friendship to Nestorius, or because he had been a cleric of a

<pb n="477"/>
church under his sway, or out of regard to petitions made by some in his favour,—the Holy
Council sat in the great church of Ephesus, which bears the name of Mary.</p>
<p>But when all with zeal had come together, Nestorius alone was found missing from the
council, thereupon the holy Synod sent him admonition in accordance with the canons by
bishops, a first, second, and third time. But he surrounding his house with soldiers, set
himself up against the ecclesiastical laws, neither did he shew himself, nor give any satisfaction
for his iniquitous blasphemies.</p>
<p>After this the letters were read which were written to him by the most holy and most
reverend bishop of the Church of Alexandria, Cyril, which the Holy Synod approved as
being orthodox and without fault (ὀρθῶς καὶ ἀλήπτως ἔχειν), and in no point out of
agreement either with the divinely inspired Scriptures, or with the faith handed down and
set forth in the great synod of holy Fathers, which assembled sometime ago at Nice in
Bithynia, as your holiness also rightly having examined this has given witness.</p>
<p>On the other hand there was read the letter of Nestorius, which was written to the already
mentioned most holy and reverend brother of ours and fellow-minister, Cyril, and the Holy
Synod was of opinion that those things which were taught in it were wholly alien from the
Apostolic and Evangelical faith, sick with many and strange blasphemies.</p>
<p>His most impious expositions were likewise read, and also the letter written to him by
your holiness, in which he was properly condemned as one who had written blasphemy and
had inserted irreligious views (φωνᾶς) in his private exegesis, and after this a just sentence
of deposition was pronounced against him; especially is this sentence just, because he is so
far removed from being penitent, or from a confession of the matters in which he blasphemed,
while yet he had the Church of Constantinople, that even in the very metropolis of the
Ephesians, he delivered a sermon to certain of the Metropolitical bishops, men who were
not ignorant, but learned and God-fearing, in which he was bold enough to say, “I do not
confess a two or three months old God,” and he said other things more outrageous than
this.</p>
<p>Therefore as an impious and most pestilent heresy, which perverts our most pure religion
(θρησκείαν) and which overthrows from the foundation the whole economy of the mystery
<del>i.e. the Incarnation</del>, we cast it down, as we have said above. But it was not possible, as it
seemed, that those who had the sincere love of Christ, and were zealous in the Lord should
not experience many trials. For we had hoped that the most reverend John, bishop of Antioch
would have praised the sedulous care and piety of the Synod, and that perchance he would
have blamed the slowness of Nestorius’s deposition. But all things turned out contrary to
our hope. For he was found to be an enemy, and a most warlike one, to the holy Synod,
and even to the orthodox faith of the churches, as these things indicate.</p>
<p>For as soon as he was come to Ephesus, before he had even shaken off the dust of the
journey, or changed his travelling dress, he assembled those who had sided with Nestorius

<pb n="478"/>
and who had uttered blasphemies against their head, and only not derided the glory of
Christ, and gathering as a college to himself, I suppose, thirty men, having the name of
bishops (some of whom were without sees, wandering about and having no dioceses, others
again had for many years been deposed for serious causes from their metropolises, and with
these were Pelagians and the followers of Celestius, and some of those who were turned out
of Thessaly), he had the presumption to commit a piece of iniquity no man had ever done
before. For all by himself he drew up a paper which he called a deposition, and reviled and
reproached the most holy and reverend Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, and the most reverend
Memnon, bishop of Ephesus, our brother, and fellow-minister, none of us knowing anything
about it, and not even those who were thus reviling knew what was being done, nor for what
reason they had presumed to do this. But ignoring the anger of God for such behaviour,
and unheeding the ecclesiastical canons, and forgetting that they were hastening to destruction
by such a course of action, under the name of an excommunication, they then reviled
the whole Synod. And placing these acts of theirs on the public bulletin boards, they exposed
them to be read by such as chose to do so, having posted them on the outside of the theatres,
that they might make a spectacle of their impiety. But not even was this the limit of their
audacity; but as if they had done something in accordance with the canons, they dared to
bring what they had done to the ears of the most pious and Christ-loving Emperors. Things
being in this condition, the most holy and reverend Cyril, bishop of Alexandria and the
most reverend Memnon bishop of the city of Ephesus, offered some books composed by
themselves and accusing the most reverend Bishop John and those who with him had done
this thing, and conjuring our holy Synod that John and those with him should be summoned
according to the canons, so that they might apologize for their daring acts, and if they had
any complaints to make they might speak and prove them, for in their written deposition,
or rather sheet of abuse, they made this statement as a pretext, “They are Apollinarians, and
Arians, and Eunomians, and therefore they have been deposed by us.” When, therefore,
those who had endured their reviling were present, we again necessarily assembled in the
great church, being more than two hundred bishops, and by a first, second, and third call
on two days, we summoned John and his companions to the Synod, in order that they might
examine those who had been reviled, and might make explanations, and tell the causes
which led them to draw up the sentence of deposition; but he273 did not dare to come.</p>
<p>But it was right that he, if he could truly prove the before-mentioned holy men to be
heretics, both should come and prove the truth of that which, accepted as a true and indubitable
crime, induced the temerarious sentence against them. But being condemned by his
own conscience he did not come. Now what he had planned was this. For he thought that
when that foundation-less and most unjust reviling was done away, the just vote of the
<note type="footnote">273 Plural in the Greek but singular in the Latin, which the critical editors consider the correct reading.</note>

<pb n="479"/>
Synod which it cast against the heretic Nestorius would likewise be dissolved. Being justly
vexed, therefore, we determined to inflict according to law the same penalty upon him and
those who were with him, which he contrary to law had pronounced against those who had
been convicted of no fault. But although most justly and in accordance with law he would
have suffered this punishment yet in the hope that by our patience his temerity might be
conquered, we have reserved this to the decision of your holiness. In the meanwhile, we
have deprived them of communion and have taken from them all priestly power, so that
they may not be able to do any harm by their opinions. For those who thus ferociously, and
cruelly, and uncanonically are wont to rush to such frightful and most wicked things, how
was it not necessary that they should be stripped of the powers which <del>as a matter of fact</del>
they did not possess,274 of being able to do harm.</p>
<p>With our brethren and fellow-ministers, both Cyril the bishop and Memnon, who had
endured reproval at their hands, we are all in communion, and after the rashness <del>of their
accusers</del> we both have and do perform the liturgy in common, all together celebrating the
Synaxis, having made of none effect their play in writing, and having thus shewn that it
lacked all validity and effect. For it was mere reviling and nothing else. For what kind of a
synod could thirty men hold, some of whom were marked with the stamp of heresy, and
some without sees and ejected <del>from their dioceses</del>? Or what strength could it have in opposition
to a synod gathered from all the whole world? For there were sitting with us the
most reverend bishops Arcadius and Projectus, and with them the most holy presbyter
Philip, all of whom were sent by your holiness, who gave to us your presence and filled the
place of the Apostolic See (τῆς ἀποστολικῆς καθέδρας). Let then your holiness be angered
at what took place. But if license were granted to such as wished to pour reproval upon the
greater sees, and thus unlawfully and uncanonically to give sentence or rather to utter revilings
against those over whom they have no power, against those who for religion have endured
such great conflicts, by reason of which now also piety shines forth through the
prayers of your holiness <del>if, I say, all this should be tolerated</del>, the affairs of the Church
would fall into the greatest confusion. But when those who dare to do such things shall
have been chastised aright, all disturbance will cease, and the reverence due to the canons
will be observed by all.</p>
<p>When there had been read in the holy Synod what had been done touching the deposition
of the most irreligious Pelagians and Coelestines, of Coelestius, and Pelagius, and Julian, and
Præsidius, and Florus, and Marcellian, and Orontius, and those inclined to like errors, we
also deemed it right (ἐδικαιώσαμεν ) that the determinations of your holiness concerning
them should stand strong and firm. And we all were of the same mind, holding them deposed.
And that you may know in full all things that have been done, we have sent you a

<head>The Definition of the Holy and Ecumenical Synod of Ephesus Against
the Impious Messalians Who are Also Called Euchetæ and Enthusiasts.</head>
<p>(Found in Latin only. Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 809.)</p>
<p>When the most pious and religious bishops, Valerian and Amphilochius had come to
us, they proposed that we should consider in common the case of the Messalians, that is the
Euchetes or Enthusiasts, who were flourishing in Pamphylia, or by what other name this
most contaminating heresy is called. And when we were considering the question, the most
pious and religious bishop Valerian, presented to us a synodical schedule which had been
drawn up concerning them in the great city of Constantinople, under Sisinnius of blessed
memory: What we read therein was approved by all, as well composed and as a due
presentation of the case. And it seemed good to us all, and to the most pious bishops Valerian
and Amphilochius and to all the most pious bishops of the provinces of Pamphylia and
Lycaonia, that all things contained in that Synodical chart should be confirmed and in no
way rescinded; also that the action taken at Alexandria might also be made firm, so that all
those who throughout the whole province are of the Messalian or Enthusiastic heresy, or
suspected of being tainted with that heresy, whether clerics or laymen, may come together;
and if they shall anathematize in writing, according to the decrees pronounced in the
aforesaid synod <del>their errors</del>, if they are clergymen they may remain such; and if laymen
they may be admitted to communion. But if they refuse to anathematize, if they were
presbyters or deacons or in any other ecclesiastical grade, let them be cast out of the clergy
and from their grade, and also from communion; if they be lay-men let them be anathematized.</p>
<p>Furthermore those convicted of this heresy are no more to be permitted to have the rule
of our monasteries, lest tares be sown and increase. And we give command that the most
pious bishops Valerian and Amphilochius, and the rest of the most reverend bishops of the
whole province shall pay attention that this decree be carried into effect. In addition to this
it seemed good that the filthy book of this heresy, which is called the “Asceticon,” should
be anathematized, as composed by heretics, a copy of which the most religious and pious
Valerian brought with him. Likewise anything savouring of their impiety which may be
found among the people, let it be anathema.</p>
<p>Moreover when they come together, let there be commended by them in writing such
things as are useful and necessary for concord, and communion, and arrangement (dispositionem
vel dispensationem). But should any question arise in connexion with the present
business, and if it should prove to be difficult and ambiguous, what is not approved by the
most pious bishops Valerian and Amphilochius, and the other bishops throughout the
province, they ought to discuss all things by reference to what is written. And if the most
pious bishops of the Lycians or of the Lycaonians shall have been passed over; nevertheless

<pb n="482"/>
let not a Metropolitan be left out of whatever province he may be. And let these things be
inserted in the Acts so that if any have need of them they would find how also to expound
these things more diligently to others.</p>

<head>Note on the Messalians or Massalians.</head>
<p>(Tillemont, Mémoires, Tom. VIII., Seconde Partie. Condensed.)</p>
<p>St. Epiphanius distinguishes two sorts of persons who were called by the name of Messalians,
the one and the more ancient were heathen, the other were Christian in name.</p>
<p>The Messalians who bore the Christian name had no beginning, nor end, nor chief, nor
fixed faith. Their first writers were Dadoes, Sabas, Adelphus, Hermes, Simeon and some
others. Adelphus was neither monk nor clerk, but a layman. Sabas had taken the habit of
an anchorite and was surnamed “the Eunuch,” because he had mutilated himself. Adelphus
was of Mesopotamia and was considered their leader, so that they are sometimes called
“Adelphians.” They are also called “Eustathians.” “Euchites” is the Greek equivalent of
“Messalians” in Hebrew. They were also called “Enthusiasts” or “Corentes” because of the
agitation the devils caused them, which they attributed to the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>St. Epiphanius thought that these heretics sprang up in the time of Constance, although
Theodoret does not put them down until the days of Valentinian. They came from Mesopotamia,
but spread as far as Antioch by the year 376.</p>
<p>They pretended to renounce the world, and to give up their possessions, and under the
habit of monks they taught Manichæan impieties, and others still more detestable.</p>
<p>Their principal tenet was that everyone inherited from his ancestors a demon, who had
possession of his soul from the moment of his birth, and always led it to evil. That baptism
cut away the outside branches of sin, but could not free the soul of this demon, and that
therefore its reception was useless. That only constant prayer could drive out this demon.
That when it was expelled, the Holy Spirit descended and gave visible and sensible marks
of his presence, and delivered the body from all the uprisings of passion, and the soul from
the inclination to evil, so that afterwards there was no need of fasting, nor of controlling
lust by the precepts of the Gospel.</p>
<p>Besides this chief dogma, gross errors, contrary to the first principles of religion, were
attributed to them. That the divinity changed itself in different manners to unite itself to
their souls. They held that the body of Christ was infinite like his divine nature; they did
not hesitate to say that his body was at first full of devils which were driven out when the
Word took it upon him.276 They claimed that they possessed clear knowledge of the state
of souls after death, read the hearts and desires of man, the secrets of the future and saw the
Holy Trinity with their bodily eyes. They affirmed that man could not only attain perfection
but equal the deity in virtue and knowledge.</p>
<note type="footnote">276 They were therefore Nestorians.</note>

<pb n="484"/>
<p>They never fasted, slept men and women together, in warm weather in the open streets.
But certain say that before attaining to this liberty of license three years of mortification
were required.</p>
<p>The most well-known point of their discipline is that they forbade all manual labour as
evil, and unworthy of the spiritual.</p>
<p>Harmenopulus in his Basilicæ (Tom. I. Lib. ix.) says that they held the Cross in horror,
that they refused to honour the Holy Virgin, or St. John the Baptist, or any of the Saints
unless they were Martyrs; that they mutilated themselves at will, that they dissolved marriages,
that they foreswore and perjured themselves without scruple, that women were appointed
as mistresses of the sect to instruct and govern men, even priests.</p>
<p>Although so opposed to the faith of the Church, yet for all this the Messalians did not
separate themselves from her communion. They did not believe in the Communion as a
mystery which sanctifies us, which must be approached with fear and faith, but only came
to the holy Table to hide themselves and to pass for Catholics, for this was one of their artifices.
When asked, they had no hesitation in denying all that they believed, and were willing
to anathematize those who thought with them. And all this they did without fear, because
they were taught they had attained perfection, that is impassibility.</p>
<p>Vide Theodoret, H. E., Lib. iv., cap. xi.</p>
<p>Photius tells us that John of Antioch wrote against these heretics.</p>
<p>St. Maximus the Abbot speaks of this heresy as still existing in the VIIth Century, and
as practising the most abominable infamies. Photius bears witness of its resuscitation in
his days in Cappadocia with its wonted corruptions. Harmenopulus remarks that a certain
Eleutherius of Paphlagonia had added to it new crimes, and that in part it became the source
of the sect of the Bogomiles, so well known in the decadence of the Greek empire.</p>

<head>Decree of the Synod in the Matter of Euprepius and Cyril.</head>
<p>(Found in Latin only. Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 810.)</p>
<p>The petition of the most pious bishops Euprepius and Cyril, which is set forth in the
papers they offered, is honest. Therefore from the holy canons and the external laws, which
have from ancient custom the force of law,277 let no innovation be made in the cities of
Europa, but according to the ancient custom they shall be governed by the bishops by whom
they have been formerly governed. For since there never was a metropolitan who had power
otherwise, so neither hereafter shall there be any departure from the ancient custom.</p>

<p>Two Thracian bishops, Euprepius of Biza (Bizya) and Cyril of Coele, gave occasion for
a decree, praying for protection against their Metropolitan, Fritilas of Heraclea, who had
gone over to the party of John of Antioch, and at the same time for the confirmation of the
previous practice of holding two bishoprics at the same time. The Synod granted both.</p>

<head>General Introduction.</head>
<p>I should consider it a piece of impertinence were I to attempt to add anything to what
has been already said with regard to the Council of Chalcedon. The literature upon the
subject is so great and so bitterly polemical that I think I shall do well in laying before my
readers the Acts, practically complete on all disputed points, and to leave them to draw their
own conclusions. I shall not, however, be liable to the charge of unfairness if I quote at some
length the deductions of the Eagle of Meaux, the famous Bossuet, from these acts; and since
his somewhat isolated position as a Gallican gives him a singular fitness to serve in this and
similar questions as a mediator between Catholics and Protestants, his remarks upon this
Council will, I think, be read with great interest and respect.</p>
<p>(Bossuet. Defensio Dec. Cleri Gallic. Lib. VII., cap. xvij. <del>Translation by Allies</del>.)</p>
<p>An important point treated in the Council of Chalcedon, that is, the establishing of the
faith, and the approval of Leo’s letter, is as follows: Already almost the whole West, and
most of the Easterns, with Anatolius himself, Bishop of Constantinople, had gone so far as
to confirm by subscription that letter, before the council took place; and in the council itself
the Fathers had often cried out, “We believe, as Leo: Peter hath spoken by Leo: we have all
subscribed the letter: what has been set forth is sufficient for the Faith: no other exposition
may be made.” Things went so far, that they would hardly permit a definition to be made
by the council. But neither subscriptions privately made before the council, nor these
vehement cries of the Fathers in the council, were thought sufficient to tranquillize minds
in so unsettled a state of the Church, for fear that a matter so important might seem determined
rather by outcries than by fair and legitimate discussion. And the clergy of Constantinople
exclaimed, “It is a few who cry out, not the whole council which speaks.” So it
was determined, that the letter of Leo should be lawfully examined by the council, and a
definition of faith be written by the synod itself. So the acts of foregoing councils being
previously read, the magistrates proposed concerning Leo’s letter, “As we see the divine
Gospels laid before your Piety, let each one of the assembled bishops declare, whether the
exposition of the 318 Fathers at Nice, and of the 150 who afterwards assembled in the imperial
city, agrees with the letter of the most reverend Archbishop Leo.”</p>
<p>After the question as to examining the letter of Leo was put in this form, it will be worth
while to weigh the sentences and, as they are called, the votes of the Fathers, in order to
understand from the beginning why they approved of the letter; why they afterwards defended
it with so much zeal; why, finally, it was ratified after so exact an examination of the council.
Anatolius first gives his sentence. “The letter of the most holy and religious Archbishop
Leo agrees with the creed of our 318 Fathers at Nice, and of the 150 who afterwards assembled
at Constantinople, and confirmed the same faith, and with the proceedings at Ephesus under

<pb n="488"/>
the most blessed Cyril, who is among the saints, by the Ecumenical and holy Council, when
it condemned Nestorius. I therefore agree to it, and willingly subscribe to it.” These are
the words of one plainly deliberating, not blindly subscribing out of obedience. The rest
say to the same effect: “It agrees, and I subscribe.” Many plainly and expressly, “It agrees,
and I therefore subscribe.” Some add, “It agrees, and I subscribe, as it is correct.” Others,
“I am sure that it agrees.” Others, “As it is concordant, and has the same aim, we embrace
it, and subscribe.” Others, “This is the faith we have long held: this we hold: in this we
were baptized: in this we baptize.” Others, and a great part, “As I see, as I feel, as I have
proved, as I find that it agrees, I subscribe.” Others, “As I am persuaded, instructed, informed,
that all agrees, I subscribe.” Many set forth their difficulties, mostly arising from a foreign
language; others from the subject matter, saying, that they had heard the letter, “and in very
many points were assured it was right; some few words stood in their way, which seemed
to point at a certain division in the person of Christ.” They add, that they had been informed
by Paschasinus and the Legates “that there is no division, but one Christ; therefore,” they
say, “we agree and subscribe.” Others after mentioning what Paschasinus and Lucentius
had said, thus conclude: “By this we have been satisfied and, considering that it agrees in
all things with the holy Fathers, we agree and subscribe.” Where the Illyrian bishops, and
others who before that examination had expressed their acclamations to the letter, again
cry out, “We all say the same thing, and agree with this.” So that, indeed, it is evident that,
in the council itself, and before it their agreement is based on this that, after weighing the
matter, they considered, they judged, they were persuaded, that all agreed with the Fathers,
and perceived that the common faith of all and each had been set forth by Leo. This is that
examination of Leo’s letter, synodically made at Chalcedon, and placed among the acts.</p>
<p>(Gallia Orthod., LIX.)</p>
<p>Nor did Anatolius and the other bishops receive it, until they had deliberated, and found
that Leo’s letter agreed with the preceding councils.</p>
<p>(Gallia Orthod., LX.)</p>
<p>But here a singular discussion arises between the eminent Cardinals Bellarmine and
Baronius. The latter, and with him a large number of our theologians, recognize the letter
of Leo as the Type and Rule of faith, by which all Churches were bound: but Bellarmine,
alarmed at the examination which he could not deny, answers thus: “Leo had sent his letter
to the council, not as containing his final and definitive sentence, but as an instruction, assisted
by which the bishops might form a better judgment.” But, most eminent man, allow
me to say that Leo, upon the appeal of Eutyches, and at the demand of Flavian, composed
this letter for a summary of the faith, and sent it to every Church in all parts, when as yet
no one thought about a council. Therefore it was not an instruction to the council which

<pb n="489"/>
he provided, but an Apostolic sentence which he put forth. The fact is that out of this strait
there was no other escape: Baronius will not allow that a letter, confirmed by so great an
authority of the Apostolic See, should be attributed to any other power but that which is
supreme and indefectible: Bellarmine will not take that to emanate from the supreme and
indefectible authority, which was subjected to synodical inquiry, and deliberation. What,
then, is the issue of this conflict, unless that it is equally evident that the letter was written
with the whole authority of the Apostolic See, and yet subjected, as usual, to the examination
of an Universal Council.</p>
<p>(Ib. LXI.)</p>
<p>And in this we follow no other authority than Leo himself, who speaks thus in his letter
to Theodoret: “What God had before decreed by our ministry, he confirmed by the irreversible
assent of the whole brotherhood, to shew that what was first put forth in form by the
First See of all, and then received by the judgment of the whole Christian world, really proceeded
from himself.” Here is a decree, as Baronius says, but not as Bellarmine says, an instruction:
here is a judgment of the whole world upon a decree of the Apostolic See. He
proceeds: “For in order that the consent of other sees to that which the Lord of all appointed
to preside over the rest might not appear flattery, nor any other adverse suspicion creep in,
persons were at first found who doubted concerning our judgments.” And not only heretics,
but even the Fathers of the council themselves, as the acts bear witness. Here the First See
shews a fear of flattery, if doubt about its judgments were forbidden. Moreover, “The truth
itself likewise is both more clearly conspicuous, and more strongly maintained, when after
examination confirms what previous faith had taught.” Here in plain words he speaks of
an examination by the council, de fide, not by himself, as they wretchedly object, but of that
faith which the decretal letter set forth. And at length that same letter is issued as the Rule,
but confirmed by the assent of the universal holy Council, or as he had before said, after
that it is confirmed by the irreversible assent of the whole Brotherhood. Out of this expression
of that great Pontiff, the Gallican clergy drew theirs, that in questions of faith the
judgment is, what Tertullian calls, “not to be altered;” what Leo calls, “not to be reconsidered,”
only when the assent of the Church is added.</p>
<p>(Defens. Dec. Cleri Gall. VII. xvij.)</p>
<p>This certainly no one can be blamed for holding with him and with the Fathers of
Chalcedon. The forma is set forth by the Apostolic See, yet it is to be received with a judgment,
and that free, and each bishop individually is inferior to the First, yet so that all together
pass judgment even on his decree.</p>
<p>They conceived no other way of removing all doubt; for, after the conclusion of the
synod, the Emperor thus proclaims: “Let then all profane contentions cease, for he is indeed

<pb n="490"/>
impious and sacrilegious, who, after the sentence of so many priests, leaves anything for his
own opinion to consider.” He then prohibits all discussion concerning religion; for, says
he, “he does an injury to the judgment of the most religious council, who endeavours to
open afresh, and publicly discuss, what has been once judged, and rightly ordered.” Here
in the condemnation of Eutyches is the order of Ecclesiastical judgments in questions of
faith. He is judged by his proper Bishop, Flavian: the cause is reheard, reconsidered by the
Pope St. Leo; it is decided by a declaration of the Apostolic See: after that declaration follows
the examination, inquiry, judgment of the Fathers or bishops, in a General Council: after
the declaration has been approved by the judgment of the Fathers no place is any longer left
for doubt or discussion.</p>

<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 93.)</p>
<p>Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See, stood up in the
midst with his most reverend colleagues and said: We received directions at the hands of
the most blessed and apostolic bishop of the Roman city, which is the head of all the churches,
which directions say that Dioscorus is not to be allowed a seat in this assembly, but that if
he should attempt to take his seat he is to be cast out. This instruction we must carry out;
if now your holiness so commands let him be expelled or else we leave.278</p>
<p>The most glorious judges and the full senate said: What special charge do you prefer
against the most reverend bishop Dioscorus?</p>
<p>Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See, said: Since he has come, it is necessary that objection be made to him.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges and the whole senate said: In accordance with what has been
said, let the charge under which he lies, be specifically made.</p>
<p>Lucentius, the most reverend bishop having the place of the Apostolic See, said: Let
him give a reason for his judgment. For he undertook to give sentence against one over
whom he had no jurisdiction. And he dared to hold a synod without the authority of the
Apostolic See, a thing which had never taken place nor can take place.279</p>
<p>Paschasinus the most reverend bishop, holding the place of the Apostolic See, said: We
cannot go counter to the decrees of the most blessed and apostolic bishop <del>“Pope” for
“bishop” in the Latin</del>, who governs the Apostolic See, nor against the ecclesiastical canons
nor the patristic traditions.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges and the full senate, said: It is proper that you should set forth
specifically in what he hath gone astray.</p>
<note type="footnote">278 This whole paragraph reads with material differences in the Latin. Moreover while the Greek text is clear
and grammatical, the Latin is most incorrect and halting. Leo is described as “Pope of the city of Rome,” instead
of “bishop of Rome.”</note>
<note type="footnote">279 This statement, so absolutely contrary to fact, has been a sore difficulty to the commentators. Arendt
(Leo the Great and his Times, § 270) says that this meant only that “he had, without permission of the Pope,
taken the presidency there, and conducted the proceedings, for Leo himself had acknowledged the synod by the fact that he allowed his legates to be present at it.” Almost the same is the explanation of the Ballerini (Leo M. Opera, Tom. ii. 460, n. 15.)</note>

<pb n="492"/>
<p>Lucentius, the venerable bishop and holding the place of the Apostolic See, said: We
will not suffer so great a wrong to be done us and you, as that he who is come to be judged
should sit down <del>as one to give judgment</del>.</p>
<p>The glorious judges and the whole senate said: If you hold the office of judge, you ought
not to defend yourself as if you were to be judged.</p>
<p>And when Dioscorus the most religious bishop of Alexandria at the bidding of the most
glorious judges and of the sacred assembly (τῆς ἱερᾶς συγκλήτου280) had sat down in the
midst, and the most reverend Roman bishops also had sat down in their proper places, and
kept silence, Eusebius, the most reverend bishop of the city of Dorylæum, stepping into the
midst, said:</p>
<p><del>He then presented a petition, and the Acts of the Latrocinium were read. Also the Acts
of the council of Constantinople under Flavian against Eutyches (col. 175).</del></p>
<p>And when they were read, the most glorious judges and immense assembly (ὑπερφυὴς
σύγκλητος) said: What do the most reverend bishops of the present holy synod say? When
he thus expounded the faith did Flavian, of holy memory, preserve the orthodox and catholic
religion, or did he in any respect err concerning it?</p>
<p>Paschasinus the most reverend bishop, representing the Apostolic See, said; Flavian of
blessed memory hath most holily and perfectly expounded the faith. His faith and exposition
agrees with the epistle of the most blessed and apostolic man, the bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>Anatolius the most reverend archbishop of Constantinople said; The blessed Flavian
hath beautifully and orthodoxly set forth the faith of our fathers.</p>
<p>Lucentius, the most reverend bishop, and legate of the Apostolic See, said; Since the
faith of Flavian of blessed memory agrees with the Apostolic See and the tradition of the
fathers it is just that the sentence by which he was condemned by the heretics should be
turned back upon them by this most holy synod.</p>
<p>Maximus the most reverend bishop of Antioch in Syria, said: Archbishop Flavian of
blessed memory hath set forth the faith orthodoxly and in accordance with the most belovedof-
God and most holy Archbishop Leo. And this we all receive with zeal.</p>
<p>Thalassius, the most reverend bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia said; Flavian of blessed
memory hath spoken in accordance with Cyril of blessed memory.</p>
<p><del>And so, one after another, the bishops expressed their opinions. The reading of the acts
of the Council of Constantinople was then continued.</del></p>
<p>And at this point of the reading, Dioscorus, the most reverend Archbishop of Alexandria
said, I receive “the of two;” “the two” I do not receive (τὸ ἐκ δύο δέχομαι· τὸ δύο, οὐ δέχομαι).
I am forced to be impudent, but the matter is one which touches my soul.</p>
<note type="footnote">280 The Latin here has the usual form “amplissimus senatus,” for which the Greek is περιφανέστατοι συγκλητικοὶ.</note>

<pb n="493"/>
<p><del>After a few remarks the reading was continued and the rest of the acts of the Latrocinium
of Ephesus completed. The judges then postponed to the morrow the setting forth a decree on
the faith but intimated that Dioscorus and his associates should suffer the punishment to
which they unjustly sentenced Flavian. This met with the approval of all the bishops except
those of Illyrica who said: “We all have erred, let us all be pardoned.” (col. 323.) </del></p>
<p>The most glorious judges and the whole senate said; Let each one of the most reverend
bishops of the present synod, hasten to set forth how he believes, writing without any fear,
but placing the fear of God before his eyes; knowing that our most divine and pious lord
believes according to the ecthesis of the three hundred and eighteen holy fathers at Nice,
and according to the ecthesis of the one hundred and fifty after them, and according to the
Canonical epistles and ectheses of the holy fathers Gregory, Basil, Athanasius, Hilary, Ambrose,
and according to the two canonical epistles of Cyril, which were confirmed and
published in the first Council of Ephesus, nor does he in any point depart from the faith of
the same. For the most reverend archbishop of Old Rome, Leo, appears to have sent a letter
to Flavian of blessed memory, with reference to Eutyches’s unbelieving doubt which was
springing up against the Catholic Church.</p>

of the condemnation of the most reverend bishop Flavian of blessed memory and Eusebius,
and it was patent to you all with what justice and accuracy the examination was conducted:
and it was proved that they had been cruelly and improperly condemned. What course we
should pursue in this matter became clear after your deliberations. Now however the
question to be enquired into, studied, and decided, is how the true faith is to be established,
which is the chief end for which this Council has been assembled. As we know that ye are
to render to God a strict account not only for your own souls in particular, but as well for
the souls of all of us who desire rightly to be taught all things that pertain to religion, and
that all ambiguity be taken away, by the agreement and consent of all the holy fathers, and
by their united exposition and doctrine; hasten therefore without any fear of pleasing or
displeasing, to set forth (ἐκθέσθαι) the pure faith, so that they who do not seem to believe
with all the rest, may be brought to unity through the acknowledging of the truth. For we
wish you to know that the most divine and pious lord of the whole world and ourselves hold
the orthodox faith set forth by the 318 and by the 150 holy fathers, and what also has been
taught by the rest of the most holy and glorious fathers, and in accordance with this is our
belief.</p>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried; Any other setting forth (ἔκθεσιν ἄλλην) no one makes,
neither will we attempt it, neither will we dare to set forth <del>anything new</del> (ἐκθεσθαι). For
the fathers taught, and in their writings are preserved, what things were set forth by them,
and further than this we can say nothing.</p>
<p>Cecropius, the most reverend bishop of Sebastopol said: The matters concerning Eutyches
have been examined, and the most holy archbishop of Rome has given a form (τύπον)
which we follow and to his letter we all <del>i.e. those in his neighbourhood</del> have subscribed.</p>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried: These are the opinions of all of us. The expositions
(ἐκτεθέντα) already made are quite sufficient: it is not lawful to make any other.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges and great senate said, If it pleases your reverence, let the most
holy patriarch of each province, choosing one or two of his own province and going into
the midst, and together considering the faith, make known to all what is agreed upon. So
that if, as we desire, all be of one mind, all ambiguity may be removed: But if some entertain
contrary opinions (which we do not believe to be the case) we may know what their opinions
are.</p>

<pb n="495"/>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried out, we make no new exposition in writing. This is
the law, [i.e. of the Third Synod] which teaches that what has been set forth is sufficient.
The law wills that no other exposition should be made. Let the sayings of the Fathers remain
fast.</p>
<p>Florentius, the most reverend bishop of Sardis, said, since it is not possible for those
who follow the teaching of the holy Synod of Nice, which was confirmed rightly and piously
at Ephesus, to draw up suddenly a declaration of faith in accordance with the faith of the
holy fathers Cyril and Celestine, and of the letter of the most holy Leo, we therefore pray
your magnificence to give us time, so that we may be able to arrive at the truth of the matter
with a fitting document, although so far as we are concerned, who have subscribed the letter
of the most holy Leo, nothing further is needed.</p>
<p>Cecropius, the most reverend bishop of Sebastopol, said, The faith has been well defined
by the 318 holy fathers and confirmed by the holy fathers Athanasius, Cyril, Celestine, Hilary,
Basil, Gregory, and now once again by the most holy Leo: and we pray that those things
which were decreed by the 318 holy fathers, and by the most holy Leo be read.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges and great Senate said: Let there be read the expositions
(ἐκτεθέντα) of the 318 fathers gathered together at Nice.
Eunomius, the most reverend bishop of Nicomedia read from a book <del>the Exposition
of faith of the 318 fathers.281</del></p>
<p>The Exposition of faith of the Council held at Nice.</p>
<p>“In the consulate of Paul and Julian” etc.</p>
<p>“We believe in one God,” etc.</p>
<p>“But those who say,” etc.</p>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried out; This is the orthodox faith; this we all believe: into
this we were baptized; into this we baptize: Blessed Cyril so taught: this is the true faith:
this is the holy faith: this is the everlasting faith: into this we were baptized: into this we
baptize: we all so believe: so believes Leo, the Pope (ὁ πάπας): Cyril thus believed: Pope
Leo so interpreted it.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges and great senate said, Let there be read what was set forth by
the 150 holy fathers.</p>
<p>Aëtius, the reverend deacon of Constantinople read from a book <del>the creed of the 150
fathers.282</del></p>

<p>All the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of all of us: we all so believe.</p>
<p>The reverend archdeacon Aëtius said, There remains the letter of Cyril of holy and

which was approved by all the most holy bishops assembled in the first Council at Ephesus,
called to condemn the same Nestorius, and which was confirmed by the subscription of all.
There is also another letter of the same Cyril, of blessed memory, which he wrote to John,
of blessed memory, sometime bishop of the great city of Antioch, which likewise was confirmed.

Pat. Græc., Tom. LXXVII. <del>Cyrilli Opera, Tom. X.</del>, col. 173. This is the letter which is often
styled “the Ephesine Creed.”)</p>
<p>Cyril to my lord, beloved brother, and fellow minister John, greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>“Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad” for the middle wall of partition has
been taken away, and grief has been silenced, and all kind of difference of opinion has been
removed; Christ the Saviour of us all having awarded peace to his churches, through our
being called to this by our most devout and beloved of God kings, who are the best imitators
of the piety of their ancestors in keeping the right faith in their souls firm and immovable,
for they chiefly give their mind to the affairs of the holy Churches, in order that they may
have the noted glory forever and show forth their most renowned kingdom, to whom also
Christ himself the Lord of powers distributes good things with plenteous hand and gives to
prevail over their enemies and grants them victory. For he does not lie in saying: “As I live
saith the Lord, them that honour me, I will honour.” For when my lord, my most-belovedof-
God, fellow-minister and brother Paul, had arrived in Alexandria, we were filled with
gladness, and most naturally at the coming of such a man as a mediator, who was ready to
work beyond measure that he might overcome the envy of the devil and heal our divisions,
and who by removing the offences scattered between us, would crown your Church and
ours with harmony and peace.</p>
<p>Of the reason of the disagreement it is superfluous to speak. I deem it more useful both
to think and speak of things suitable to the time of peace. We were therefore delighted at
meeting with that distinguished and most pious man, who expected perhaps to have no
small struggle, persuading us that it is necessary to form an alliance for the peace of the
Church, and to drive away the laughter of the heterodox, and for this end to blunt the goads
of the stubbornness of the devil. He found us ready for this, so as absolutely to need no labour
to be bestowed upon us. For we remembered the Saviour’s saying; “My peace I give unto
you, my peace I leave with you.” We have been taught also to say in prayers: “O Lord our
God give us peace, for thou hast given us all things.” So that if anyone should be in the
participation of the peace furnished from God, he is not lacking in any good. That as a
matter of fact, the disagreement of the Churches happened altogether unnecessarily and
inopportunely, we now have been fully satisfied by the document brought by my lord, the
most pious bishop Paul, which contains an unimpeachable confession of faith, and this he
asserted to have been prepared, by your holiness and by the God-beloved Bishops there.
The document is as follows, and is set down verbatim in this our epistle.</p>

<pb n="498"/>
<p>Concerning the Virgin Mother of God, we thus think and speak; and of the manner of
the Incarnation of the Only Begotten Son of God, necessarily, not by way of addition but
for the sake of certainty, as we have received from the beginning from the divine Scriptures
and from the tradition of the holy fathers, we will speak briefly, adding nothing whatever
to the Faith set forth by the holy Fathers in Nice. For, as we said before, it suffices for all
knowledge of piety and the refutation of all false doctrine of heretics. But we speak, not
presuming on the impossible; but with the confession of our own weakness, excluding those
who wish us to cling to those things which transcend human consideration.</p>
<p>We confess, therefore, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, perfect
God, and perfect Man of a reasonable soul and flesh consisting; begotten before the ages of
the Father according to his Divinity, and in the last days, for us and for our salvation, of
Mary the Virgin according to his humanity, of the same substance with his Father according
to his Divinity, and of the same substance with us according to his humanity; for there became
a union of two natures. Wherefore we confess one Christ, one Son, one Lord.</p>
<p>According to this understanding of this unmixed union, we confess the holy Virgin to
be Mother of God; because God the Word was incarnate and became Man, and from this
conception he united the temple taken from her with himself.</p>
<p>For we know the theologians make some things of the Evangelical and Apostolic
teaching about the Lord common as pertaining to the one person, and other things they
divide as to the two natures, and attribute the worthy ones to God on account of the Divinity
of Christ, and the lowly ones on account of his humanity <del>to his humanity</del>.</p>
<p>These being your holy voices, and finding ourselves thinking the same with them (“One
Lord, One Faith, One Baptism,”) we glorified God the Saviour of all, congratulating one
another that our churches and yours have the Faith which agrees with the God-inspired
Scriptures and the traditions of our holy Fathers.</p>
<p>Since I learned that certain of those accustomed to find fault were humming around
like vicious wasps, and vomiting out wretched words against me, as that I say the holy Body
of Christ was brought from heaven, and not of the holy Virgin, I thought it necessary to say
a few words concerning this to them:</p>
<p>O fools, and only knowing how to misrepresent, how have ye been led to such a judgment,
how have ye fallen into so foolish a sickness? For it is necessary, it is undoubtedly
necessary, to understand that almost all the opposition to us concerning the faith, arose
from our affirming that the holy Virgin is Mother of God. But if from heaven and not from
her the holy Body of the Saviour of all was born, how then is she understood to be Mother
of God? What then did she bring forth except it be true that she brought forth the Emmanuel
according to the flesh? They are to be laughed at who babble such things about me. For
the blessed prophet Isaiah does not lie in saying “Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear
a Son, and shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us.” Truly

<pb n="499"/>
also the holy Gabriel said to the Blessed Virgin: “Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour
with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and shall
call his name Jesus. He shall save his people from their sins.”</p>
<p>For when we say our Lord Jesus Christ descended from heaven, and from above, we do
not so say this as if from above and from heaven was his Holy Flesh taken, but rather by
way of following the divine Paul, who distinctly declares: “the first man is of the earth,
earthy; the Second Man is the Lord from heaven.”</p>
<p>We remember too, the Saviour himself saying, “And no man hath ascended up to
heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man.” Although he was born
according to his flesh, as just said, of the holy Virgin, yet God the Word came down from
above and from heaven. He “made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
of a servant,” and was called the Son of Man, yet remaining what he was, that is to say God.
For he is unchanging and unchangeable according to nature; considered already as one with his own Flesh, he is said to have come down from heaven.</p>
<p>He is also called the Man from heaven, being perfect in his Divinity and perfect in his
Humanity, and considered as in one Person. For one is the Lord Jesus Christ, although the
difference of his natures is not unknown, from which we say the ineffable union was made.</p>
<p>Will your holiness vouchsafe to silence those who say that a crasis, or mingling or
mixture took place between the Word of God and flesh. For it is likely that certain also
gossip about me as having thought or said such things.</p>
<p>But I am far from any such thought as that, and I also consider them wholly to rave who
think a shadow of change could occur concerning the Nature of the Word of God. For he
remains that which he always was, and has not been changed, nor can he ever be changed,
nor is he capable of change. For we all confess in addition to this, that the Word of God is
impassible, even though when he dispenses most wisely this mystery, he appears to ascribe
to himself the sufferings endured in his own flesh. To the same purpose the all-wise Peter
also said when he wrote of Christ as having “suffered in the flesh,” and not in the nature of
his ineffable godhead. In order that he should be believed to be the Saviour of all, by an
economic appropriation to himself, as just said, he assumed the sufferings of his own Flesh.</p>
<p>Like to this is the prophecy through the voice of the prophet, as from him, “I gave my
back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from
shame and spitting.” Let your holiness be convinced nor let anyone else be doubtful that
we altogether follow the teachings of the holy fathers, especially of our blessed and celebrated
Father Athanasius, deprecating the least departure from it.</p>
<p>I might have added many quotations from them also establishing my words, but that it
would have added to the length of my letter and it might become wearisome. And we will
allow the defined Faith, the symbol of the Faith set forth by our holy Fathers who assembled
some time ago at Nice, to be shaken by no one. Nor would we permit ourselves or others,

<pb n="500"/>
to alter a single word of those set forth, or to add one syllable, remembering the saying:
“Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set,” for it was not they who
spoke but the Spirit himself of God and the Father, who proceedeth also from him, and is
not alien from the Son, according to his essence. And this the words of the holy initiators
into mysteries confirm to us. For in the Acts of the Apostles it is written: “And after they
were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit of Jesus suffered them
not.” And the divine Paul wrote: “So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But
ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if
any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”</p>
<p>When some of those who are accustomed to turn from the right, twist my speech to
their views, I pray your holiness not to wonder; but be well assured that the followers of
every heresy gather the occasions of their error from the God-inspired Scriptures, corrupting
in their evil minds the things rightly said through the Holy Spirit, and drawing down upon
their own heads the unquenchable flame.</p>
<p>Since we have learned that certain, after having corrupted it, have set forth the orthodox
epistle of our most distinguished Father Athanasius to the Blessed Epictetus, so as thereby
to injure many; therefore it appeared to the brethren to be useful and necessary that we
should send to your holiness a copy of it from some correct ancient transcripts which exist
among us. Farewell.</p>

<p>Having read your Affection’s letter, the late arrival of which is matter of surprise to us,
and having gone through the record of the proceedings of the bishops, we have now, at last,
gained a clear view of the scandal which has risen up among you, against the integrity of
the faith; and what at first seemed obscure has now been elucidated and explained. By this
means Eutyches, who seemed to be deserving of honour under the title of Presbyter, is now
shown to be exceedingly thoughtless and sadly inexperienced, so that to him also we may
apply the prophet’s words, “He refused to understand in order to act well: he meditated
unrighteousness on his bed.” What, indeed, is more unrighteous than to entertain ungodly
thoughts, and not to yield to persons wiser and more learned? But into this folly do they
fall who, when hindered by some obscurity from apprehending the truth, have recourse,
not to the words of the Prophets, not to the letters of the Apostles, nor to the authority of
the Gospels, but to themselves; and become teachers of error, just because they have not
been disciples of the truth. For what learning has he received from the sacred pages of the
New and the Old Testament, who does not so much as understand the very beginning of
the Creed? And that which, all the world over, is uttered by the voices of all applicants for
regeneration, is still not grasped by the mind of this aged man. If, then, he knew not what
he ought to think about the Incarnation of the Word of God, and was not willing, for the
sake of obtaining the light of intelligence, to make laborious search through the whole extent
of the Holy Scriptures, he should at least have received with heedful attention that general
Confession common to all, whereby the whole body of the faithful profess that they “believe
in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was born of
the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary.” By which three clauses the engines of almost all
heretics are shattered. For when God is believed to be both “Almighty” and “Father,” it is
proved that the Son is everlasting together with himself, differing in nothing from the
Father, because he was born as “God from God,” Almighty from Almighty, Coeternal from
Eternal; not later in time, not inferior in power, not unlike him in glory, not divided from
him in essence, but the same Only-begotten and Everlasting Son of an Everlasting Parent
was “born of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary.” This birth in time in no way detracted
from, in no way added to, that divine and everlasting birth; but expended itself wholly in

the work of restoring man, who had been deceived; so that it might both overcome death,
and by its power “destroy the devil who had the power of death.” For we could not have
overcome the author of sin and of death, unless he who could neither be contaminated by
sin, nor detained by death, had taken upon himself our nature, and made it his own. For,
in fact, he was “conceived of the Holy Ghost” within the womb of a Virgin Mother, who
bore him as she had conceived him, without loss of virginity.284 But if he (Eutyches) was
not able to obtain a true conception from this pure fountain of Christian faith because by
his own blindness he had darkened for himself the brightness of a truth so clear, he should
have submitted himself to the Evangelist’s teaching; and after reading what Matthew says,
“The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham,” he
should also have sought instruction from the Apostle’s preaching; and after reading in the
Epistle to the Romans, “Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called an Apostle, separated unto
the gospel of God, which he had promised before by the prophets in the Holy Scriptures,
concerning his Son, who was made unto him of the seed of David according to the flesh,”
he should have bestowed some devout study on the pages of the Prophets; and finding that
God’s promise said to Abraham, “in thy seed shall all nations be blessed,” in order to avoid
all doubt as to the proper meaning of this “seed,” he should have attended to the Apostle’s
words, “To Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. He saith not, ‘and to seeds,’
as in the case of many, but as in the case of one, ‘and to thy seed,’ which is Christ.” He
should also have apprehended with his inward ear the declaration of Isaiah, “Behold, a
Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being
interpreted, God with us;” and should have read with faith the words of the same prophet,
“Unto us a Child has been born, unto us a Son has been given, whose power is on his
shoulder; and they shall call his name Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, Strong
God, Prince of Peace, Father of the age to come.” And he should not have spoken idly to
the effect that the Word was in such a sense made flesh, that the Christ who was brought
forth from the Virgin’s womb had the form of a man, and had not a body really derived
from his Mother’s body. Possibly his reason for thinking that our Lord Jesus Christ was
not of our nature was this—that the Angel who was sent to the blessed and ever Virgin Mary
said, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee, and therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God;” as if, because the Virgin’s conception was caused by a divine act, therefore the flesh
of him whom she conceived was not of the nature of her who conceived him. But we are
not to understand that “generation,” peerlessly wonderful, and wonderfully peerless, in such
a sense as that the newness of the mode of production did away with the proper character
of the kind. For it was the Holy Ghost who gave fecundity to the Virgin, but it was from a
<note type="footnote">284 It will be noticed here that the virgin-birth is as distinctly defined as the virgin-conception.</note>

<pb n="504"/>
body that a real body was derived; and “when Wisdom was building herself a house,” the
“Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,” that is, in that flesh which he assumed from
a human being, and which he animated with the spirit of rational life.</p>
<p>Accordingly while the distinctness of both natures and substances was preserved, and
both met in one Person, lowliness was assumed by majesty, weakness by power, mortality
by eternity; and, in order to pay the debt of our condition, the inviolable nature was united
to the passible, so that as the appropriate remedy for our ills, one and the same “Mediator
between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus,” might from one element be capable of dying
and also from the other be incapable. Therefore in the entire and perfect nature of very
man was born very God, whole in what was his, whole in what was ours. By “ours” we mean
what the Creator formed in us at the beginning and what he assumed in order to restore;
for of that which the deceiver brought in, and man, thus deceived, admitted, there was not
a trace in the Saviour; and the fact that he took on himself a share in our infirmities did not
make him a partaker in our transgressions. He assumed “the form of a servant” without
the defilement of sin, enriching what was human, not impairing what was divine: because
that “emptying of himself,” whereby the Invisible made himself visible, and the Creator and
Lord of all things willed to be one among mortals, was a stooping down in compassion, not
a failure of power. Accordingly, the same who, remaining in the form of God, made man,
was made man in the form of a servant. For each of the natures retains its proper character
without defect; and as the form of God does not take away the form of a servant, so the form
of a servant does not impair the form of God. For since the devil was glorying in the fact
that man, deceived by his craft, was bereft of divine gifts and, being stripped of his endowment
of immortality, had come under the grievous sentence of death, and that he himself, amid
his miseries, had found a sort of consolation in having a transgressor as his companion, and
that God, according to the requirements of the principle of justice, had changed his own
resolution in regard to man, whom he had created in so high a position of honour; there
was need of a dispensation of secret counsel, in order that the unchangeable God, whose
will could not be deprived of its own benignity, should fulfil by a more secret mystery his
original plan of loving kindness toward us, and that man, who had been led into fault by
the wicked subtlety of the devil, should not perish contrary to God’s purpose. Accordingly,
the Son of God, descending from his seat in heaven, and not departing from the glory of
the Father, enters this lower world, born after a new order, by a new mode of birth. After
a new order; because he who in his own sphere is invisible, became visible in ours; He who
could not be enclosed in space, willed to be enclosed; continuing to be before times, he began
to exist in time; the Lord of the universe allowed his infinite majesty to be overshadowed,
and took upon him the form of a servant; the impassible God did not disdain to be passible
Man and the immortal One to be subjected to the laws of death. And born by a new mode
of birth; because inviolate virginity, while ignorant of concupiscence, supplied the matter

<pb n="505"/>
of his flesh. What was assumed from the Lord’s mother was nature, not fault; nor does the
wondrousness of the nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, as born of a Virgin’s womb, imply
that his nature is unlike ours. For the selfsame who is very God, is also very man; and there
is no illusion in this union, while the lowliness of man and the loftiness of Godhead meet
together. For as “God” is not changed by the compassion <del>exhibited</del>, so “Man” is not
consumed by the dignity <del>bestowed</del>. For each “form” does the acts which belong to it, in
communion with the other; the Word, that is, performing what belongs to the Word, and
the flesh carrying out what belongs to the flesh; the one of these shines out in miracles, the
other succumbs to injuries. And as the Word does not withdraw from equality with the
Father in glory, so the flesh does not abandon the nature of our kind. For, as we must often
be saying, he is one and the same, truly Son of God, and truly Son of Man. God, inasmuch
as “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
Man, inasmuch as “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” God, inasmuch as “all
things were made by him, and without him nothing was made.” Man, inasmuch as he was
“made of a woman, made under the law.” The nativity of the flesh is a manifestation of
human nature; the Virgin’s child-bearing is an indication of Divine power. The infancy of
the Babe is exhibited by the humiliation of swaddling clothes: the greatness of the Highest
is declared by the voices of angels. He whom Herod impiously designs to slay is like humanity
in its beginnings; but he whom the Magi rejoice to adore on their knees is Lord of all. Now
when he came to the baptism of John his forerunner, lest the fact that the Godhead was
covered with a veil of flesh should be concealed, the voice of the Father spake in thunder
from heaven, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” Accordingly, he who,
as man, is tempted by the devil’s subtlety, is the same to whom, as God, angels pay duteous
service. To hunger, to thirst, to be weary, and to sleep, is evidently human. But to satisfy
five thousand men with five loaves, and give to the Samaritan woman that living water, to
draw which can secure him that drinks of it from ever thirsting again; to walk on the surface
of the sea with feet that sink not, and by rebuking the storm to bring down the “uplifted
waves,” is unquestionably Divine. As then—to pass by many points —it does not belong
to the same nature to weep with feelings of pity over a dead friend and, after the mass of
stone had been removed from the grave where he had lain four days, by a voice of command
to raise him up to life again; or to hang on the wood, and to make all the elements tremble
after daylight had been turned into night; or to be transfixed with nails, and to open the
gates of paradise to the faith of the robber; so it does not belong to the same nature to say,
“I and the Father are one,” and to say, “the Father is greater than I.” For although in the
Lord Jesus Christ there is one Person of God and man, yet that whereby contumely attaches
to both is one thing, and that whereby glory attaches to both is another; for from what belongs
to us he has that manhood which is inferior to the Father; while from the Father he has
equal Godhead with the Father. Accordingly, on account of this unity of Person which is

<pb n="506"/>
to be understood as existing in both the natures, we read, on the one hand, that “the Son of
Man came down from heaven,” inasmuch as the Son of God took flesh from that Virgin of
whom he was born; and on the other hand, the Son of God is said to have been crucified
and buried, inasmuch as he underwent this, not in his actual Godhead; wherein the Onlybegotten
is coeternal and consubstantial with the Father, but in the weakness of human
nature. Wherefore we all, in the very Creed, confess that “the only-begotten Son of God
was crucified and buried,” according to that saying of the Apostle, “for if they had known
it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Majesty.”</p>
<p>But when our Lord and Saviour himself was by his questions instructing the faith of the
disciples, he said, “Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am?” And when they had
mentioned various opinions held by others, he said, “But whom say ye that I am?” that is,
“I who am Son of Man, and whom you see in the form of a servant, and in reality of flesh,
whom say ye that I am?” Whereupon the blessed Peter, as inspired by God, and about to
benefit all nations by his confession, said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
Not undeservedly, therefore, was he pronounced blessed by the Lord, and derived from the
original Rock that solidity which belonged both to his virtue and to his name, who through
revelation from the Father confessed the selfsame to be both the Son of God and the Christ;
because one of these truths, accepted without the other, would not profit unto salvation,
and it was equally dangerous to believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be merely God and not man,
or merely man and not God. But after the resurrection of the Lord—which was in truth the
resurrection of a real body, for no other person was raised again than he who had been
crucified and had died—what else was accomplished during that interval of forty days than
to make our faith entire and clear of all darkness? For while he conversed with his disciples,
and dwelt with them, and ate with them, and allowed himself to be handled with careful
and inquisitive touch by those who were under the influence of doubt, for this end he came
in to the disciples when the doors were shut, and by his breath gave them the Holy Ghost,
and opened the secrets of Holy Scripture after bestowing on them the light of intelligence,
and again in his selfsame person showed to them the wound in the side, the prints of the
nails, and all the flesh tokens of the Passion, saying, “Behold my hands and my feet, that it
is I myself; handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have:” that
the properties of the Divine and the human nature might be acknowledged to remain in
him without causing a division, and that we might in such sort know that the Word is not
what the flesh is, as to confess that the one Son of God is both Word and flesh. On which
mystery of the faith this Eutyches must be regarded as unhappily having no hold, who does
not recognise our nature to exist in the Only-begotten Son of God, either by way of the
lowliness of mortality, or of the glory of resurrection. Nor has he been overawed by the
declaration of the blessed Apostle and Evangelist John, saying, “Every spirit that confesseth
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God; and every spirit which dissolveth Jesus is

<pb n="507"/>
not of God, and this is Antichrist.” Now what is to dissolve Jesus, but to separate the human
nature from him, and to make void by shameless inventions that mystery by which alone
we have been saved? Moreover, being in the dark as to the nature of Christ’s body, he must
needs be involved in the like senseless blindness with regard to his Passion also. For if he
does not think the Lord’s crucifixion to be unreal, and does not doubt that he really accepted
suffering, even unto death, for the sake of the world’s salvation; as he believes in his death,
let him acknowledge his flesh also, and not doubt that he whom he recognises as having
been capable of suffering is also Man with a body like ours; since to deny his true flesh is
also to deny his bodily sufferings. If then he accepts the Christian faith, and does not turn
away his ear from the preaching of the Gospel, let him see what nature it was that was
transfixed with nails and hung on the wood of the cross; and let him understand whence it
was that, after the side of the Crucified had been pierced by the soldier’s spear, blood and
water flowed out, that the Church of God might be refreshed both with a Laver and with a
Cup. Let him listen also to the blessed Apostle Peter when he declares, that “sanctification
by the Spirit” takes place through the “sprinkling of the blood of Christ,” and let him not
give a mere cursory reading to the words of the same Apostle, “Knowing that ye were not
redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain way of life received by
tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a Lamb without
blemish and without spot.” Let him also not resist the testimony of Blessed John the Apostle,
“And the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us from all sin.” And again, “This is the
victory which overcometh the world, even our faith;” and, “who is he that overcometh the
world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? This is he that came by water and
blood, even Jesus Christ; not in water only, but in water and blood; and it is the Spirit that
beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that bear witness—the Spirit,
the water, and the blood; and the three are one.” That is, the Spirit of sanctification, and
the blood of redemption, and the water of baptism; which three things are one, and remain
undivided, and not one of them is disjoined from connection with the others; because the
Catholic Church lives and advances by this faith, that Christ Jesus we should believe neither
manhood to exist without true Godhead, nor Godhead without true manhood. But when
Eutyches, on being questioned in your examination of him, answered, “I confess that our
Lord was of two natures before the union, but after the union I confess one nature;” I am
astonished that so absurd and perverse a profession as this of his was not rebuked by a
censure on the part of any of his judges, and that an utterance extremely foolish and extremely
blasphemous was passed over, just as if nothing had been heard which could give offence:
seeing that it is as impious to say that the Only-begotten Son of God was of two natures
before the Incarnation as it is shocking to affirm that, since the Word became flesh, there
has been in him one nature only. But lest Eutyches should think that what he said was
correct, or was tolerable, because it was not confuted by any assertion of yours, we exhort

<pb n="508"/>
your earnest solicitude, dearly beloved brother, to see that, if by God’s merciful inspiration
the case is brought to a satisfactory issue, the inconsiderate and inexperienced man be
cleansed also from this pestilent notion of his; seeing that, as the record of the proceedings
has clearly shown, he had fairly begun to abandon his own opinion when on being driven
into a corner by authoritative words of yours, he professed himself ready to say what he had
not said before, and to give his adhesion to that faith from which he had previously stood
aloof. But when he would not consent to anathematize the impious dogma you understood,
brother, that he continued in his own misbelief, and deserved to receive sentence of condemnation.
For which if he grieves sincerely and to good purpose, and understands, even though
too late, how properly the Episcopal authority has been put in motion, or if, in order to
make full satisfaction, he shall condemn viva voce, and under his own hand, all that he has
held amiss, no compassion, to whatever extent, which can be shown him when he has been
set right, will be worthy of blame, for our Lord, the true and good Shepherd, who laid down
his life for his sheep, and who came to save men’s souls and not to destroy them, wills us to
imitate his own loving kindness; so that justice should indeed constrain those who sin, but
mercy should not reject those who are converted. For then indeed is the true faith defended
with the best results, when a false opinion is condemned even by those who have followed
it. But in order that the whole matter may be piously and faithfully carried out, we have
appointed our brethren, Julius, Bishop, and Reatus, Presbyter (of the title of St. Clement)
and also my son Hilarus, Deacon, to represent us; and with them we have associated Dulcitius,
our Notary, of whose fidelity we have had good proof: trusting that the Divine assistance
will be with you, so that he who has gone astray may be saved by condemning his own unsound
opinion. May God keep you in good health, dearly beloved brother. Given on the
Ides of June, in the Consulate of the illustrious men, Asterius and Protogenes.</p>

<p>After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is
the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox
believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo.
So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the
memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so
believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe. This is the faith

there</del>? These are the things Dioscorus hid away.</p>
<p><del>Some explanations were asked by the Illyrian bishops and the answers were found satisfactory,
but yet a delay of a few days was asked for, and some bishops petitioned for a general
pardon of all who had been kept out. This proposition made great confusion, in the midst of

<head>Session III.</head>
<p><del>The imperial representatives do not seem to have been present, and after Aëtius the
Archdeacon of Constantinople had opened the Session,</del></p>
<p>Paschasinus the bishop of Lilybæum, in the province of Silicia, and holding the place
of the most holy Leo, archbishop of the Apostolic see of old Rome, said in Latin what being
interpreted is as follows: It is well known to this beloved of God synod, that divine285 letters
were sent to the blessed and apostolic pope Leo, inviting him to deign to be present at the
holy synod. But since ancient custom did not sanction this, nor the general necessity of the
time seemed to permit it, our littleness in the place of himself he τὰ τῆς ἁγίας συνόδου
επέτρεψε, and therefore it is necessary that whatever things are brought into discussion
should be examined by our interference (διαλαλιᾶς). <del>The Latin reads where I have placed
the Greek of the ordinary text, thus, “commanded our littleness to preside in his place over
this holy council.”</del> Therefore let the book presented by our most beloved-of-God brother,
and fellow-bishop Eusebius be received, and read by the beloved of God archdeacon and
primicerius of the notaries, Aëtius.</p>
<p>And Aëtius, the archdeacon and primicerius of the notaries, took the book and read as
follows.</p>
<p><del>Next follows the petition of Eusebius et post nonnulla four petitions each addressed to
“The most holy and beloved-of-God ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome
Leo, and to the holy and ecumenical Synod assembled at Chalcedon, etc., etc.;” The first
two by deacons of Alexandria, the third by a quondam presbyter of the diocese, and the fourth
by a layman also of Alexandria. After this Dioscorus was again summoned and, as he did
not come, sentence was given against him, which was communicated to him in a letter contained
in the acts. (L. and C., Conc., Tom. IV., col. 418.) The Bishops expressed their opinions for
the most part one by one, but the Roman Legates spoke together, and in their speech occurs
the following (Col. 426:)</del></p>
<p>Wherefore the most holy and blessed Leo, archbishop of the great and elder Rome,
through us, and through this present most holy synod together with286 the thrice blessed
and all-glorious Peter the Apostle, who is the rock and foundation of the Catholic Church,
and the foundation of the orthodox faith, hath stripped him of the episcopate, and hath
alienated from him all hieratic worthiness. Therefore let this most holy and great synod
sentence the before mentioned Dioscorus to the canonical penalties.</p>

<head>Session IV.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 469.)</p>
<p>The most magnificent and glorious judges and the great Senate said:</p>
<p>Let the reverend council now declare what seems good concerning the faith, since those
things which have already been disposed of have been made manifest. Paschasinus and
Lucentius, the most reverend bishops, and Boniface the most reverend presbyter, legates of
the Apostolic See through that most reverend man, bishop Paschasinus said: As the holy
and blessed and Ecumenical Synod holds fast and follows the rule of faith (fidei regulam in
the Latin Acts) which was set forth by the fathers at Nice, it also confirms the faith set forth
by the Synod of 150 fathers gathered at Constantinople at the bidding of the great
Theodosius of blessed memory. Moreover the exposition of their faith, of the illustrious
Cyril of blessed memory set forth at the Council of Ephesus (in which Nestorius was condemned)
is received. And in the third place the writings of that blessed man, Leo, Archbishop
of all the churches, who condemned the heresy of Nestorius and Eutyches, shew what the
true faith is. Likewise the holy Synod holds this faith, this it follows—nothing further can
it add nor can it take aught away.</p>
<p>When this had been translated into Greek by Beronician, the devout secretary of the
divine consistory, the most reverend bishops cried out: So we all believe, so we were baptized,
so we baptize, so we have believed, so we now believe.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges and the great senate said: Since we see that the Holy Gospels
have been placed alongside of your holiness, let each one of the bishops here assembled
declare whether the epistle of most blessed archbishop Leo is in accordance with the expos-
ition of the 318 fathers assembled at Nice and with the decrees of the 150 fathers afterwards
assembled in the royal city.</p>
<p><del>To this question the bishops answered one by one, until 161 separate opinions had been
given, when the rest of the bishops were asked by the imperial judges to give their votes in a
body (col. 508).</del></p>
<p>All the most reverend bishops cried out: We all acquiesce, we all believe thus; we are
all of the same mind. So are we minded, so we believe, etc., etc.</p>

<head>Session V.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 555.)</p>
<p>Paschasinus and Lucentius the most reverend bishops and Boniface a presbyter, vicars
of the Apostolic See of Rome, said: If they do not agree to the letter of that apostolic and
blessed man, Pope Leo, give directions that we be given our letters of dismission, and let a
synod be held there <del>i.e. in the West</del>.</p>
<p><del>A long debate then followed as to whether the decree drawn up and presented should be
accepted. This seems to have been the mind of most of the bishops. At last the commissioners
proposed a committee of twenty-two to meet with them and report to the council, and the
Emperor imposed this with the threat that otherwise they all should be sent home and a new
council called in the West. Even this did not make them yield (col. 560.)</del></p>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried out: Many years to the Emperor! Either let the
definition <del>i.e. the one presented at this session</del> stand or we go. Many years to the Emperor!</p>
<p>Cecropius, the most reverend bishop of Sebastopol, said: We ask that the definition be
read again and that those who dissent from it, and will not sign, may go about their business;
for we give our consent to these things which have been so beautifully drafted, and make
no criticisms.</p>
<p>The most blessed bishops of Illyria said: Let those who contradict be made manifest.
Those who contradict are Nestorians. Those who contradict, let them go to Rome.</p>
<p>The most magnificent and most glorious judges said: Dioscorus acknowledged that he
accepted the expression “of two natures,” but not that there were two natures. But the most
holy archbishop Leo says that there are two natures in Christ unchangeably, inseparably,
unconfusedly united in the one only-begotten Son our Saviour. Which would you follow,
the most holy Leo or Dioscorus?</p>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried out: We believe as Leo. Those who contradict are
Eutychians. Leo hath rightly expounded the faith.</p>
<p>The most magnificent and glorious judges said: Add then to the definition, according
to the judgment of our most holy father Leo, that there are two natures in Christ united
unchangeably, inseparably, unconfusedly.</p>

<head>The Definition of Faith of the Council of Chalcedon.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 562.)</p>
<p>The holy, great, and ecumenical synod, assembled by the grace of God and the command
of our most religious and Christian Emperors, Marcian and Valentinian, Augusti, at
Chalcedon, the metropolis of the Bithynian Province, in the martyry of the holy and victorious
martyr Euphemia, has decreed as follows:</p>
<p>Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, when strengthening the knowledge of the Faith in
his disciples, to the end that no one might disagree with his neighbour concerning the doctrines
of religion, and that the proclamation of the truth might be set forth equally to all
men, said, “My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.” But, since the evil one
does not desist from sowing tares among the seeds of godliness, but ever invents some new
device against the truth; therefore the Lord, providing, as he ever does, for the human race,
has raised up this pious, faithful, and zealous Sovereign, and has called together unto him
from all parts the chief rulers of the priesthood; so that, the grace of Christ our common
Lord inspiring us, we may cast off every plague of falsehood from the sheep of Christ, and
feed them with the tender leaves of truth. And this have we done with one unanimous
consent, driving away erroneous doctrines and renewing the unerring faith of the Fathers,
publishing to all men the Creed of the Three Hundred and Eighteen, and to their number
adding, as their peers, the Fathers who have received the same summary of religion. Such
are the One Hundred and Fifty holy Fathers who afterwards assembled in the great Constantinople
and ratified the same faith. Moreover, observing the order and every form relating
to the faith, which was observed by the holy synod formerly held in Ephesus, of which
Celestine of Rome and Cyril of Alexandria, of holy memory, were the leaders, we do declare
that the exposition of the right and blameless faith made by the Three Hundred and Eighteen
holy and blessed Fathers, assembled at Nice in the reign of Constantine of pious memory,
shall be pre-eminent: and that those things shall be of force also, which were decreed by
the One Hundred and Fifty holy Fathers at Constantinople, for the uprooting of the heresies
which had then sprung up, and for the confirmation of the same Catholic and Apostolic
Faith of ours.</p>
<p>The Creed of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers at Nice.</p>
<p>We believe in one God, etc.</p>
<p>Item, the Creed of the one hundred and fifty holy Fathers who were assembled at Constantinople.</p>
<p>We believe in one God, etc.</p>

<pb n="516"/>
<p>This wise and salutary formula of divine grace sufficed for the perfect knowledge and
confirmation of religion; for it teaches the perfect <del>doctrine</del> concerning Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, and sets forth the Incarnation of the Lord to them that faithfully receive it.
But, forasmuch as persons undertaking to make void the preaching of the truth have through
their individual heresies given rise to empty babblings; some of them daring to corrupt the
mystery of the Lord’s incarnation for us and refusing <del>to use</del> the name Mother of God
(Θεοτόκος) in reference to the Virgin, while others, bringing in a confusion and mixture,
and idly conceiving that the nature of the flesh and of the Godhead is all one, maintaining
that the divine Nature of the Only Begotten is, by mixture, capable of suffering; therefore
this present holy, great, and ecumenical synod, desiring to exclude every device against the
Truth, and teaching that which is unchanged from the beginning, has at the very outset
decreed that the faith of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers shall be preserved inviolate.
And on account of them that contend against the Holy Ghost, it confirms the doctrine afterwards
delivered concerning the substance of the Spirit by the One Hundred and Fifty
holy Fathers who assembled in the imperial City; which doctrine they declared unto all men,
not as though they were introducing anything that had been lacking in their predecessors,
but in order to explain through written documents their faith concerning the Holy Ghost
against those who were seeking to destroy his sovereignty. And, on account of those who
have taken in hand to corrupt the mystery of the dispensation <del>i.e. the Incarnation</del> and
who shamelessly pretend that he who was born of the holy Virgin Mary was a mere man,
it receives the synodical letters of the Blessed Cyril, Pastor of the Church of Alexandria,
addressed to Nestorius and the Easterns, judging them suitable, for the refutation of the
frenzied folly of Nestorius, and for the instruction of those who long with holy ardour for
a knowledge of the saving symbol. And, for the confirmation of the orthodox doctrines, it
has rightly added to these the letter of the President of the great and old Rome, the most
blessed and holy Archbishop Leo, which was addressed to Archbishop Flavian of blessed
memory, for the removal of the false doctrines of Eutyches, judging them to be agreeable
to the confession of the great Peter, and as it were a common pillar against misbelievers.
For it opposes those who would rend the mystery of the dispensation into a Duad of Sons;
it repels from the sacred assembly those who dare to say that the Godhead of the Only Begotten
is capable of suffering; it resists those who imagine a mixture or confusion of the two
natures of Christ; it drives away those who fancy his form of a servant is of an heavenly or
some substance other than that which was taken of us, and it anathematizes those who
foolishly talk of two natures of our Lord before the union, conceiving that after the union
there was only one.</p>
<p>Following the holy Fathers we teach with one voice that the Son <del>of God</del> and our Lord
Jesus Christ is to be confessed as one and the same <del>Person</del>, that he is perfect in Godhead
and perfect in manhood, very God and very man, of a reasonable soul and <del>human</del> body

<pb n="517"/>
consisting, consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead, and consubstantial with
us as touching his manhood; made in all things like unto us, sin only excepted; begotten of
his Father before the worlds according to his Godhead; but in these last days for us men
and for our salvation born <del>into the world</del> of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God according
to his manhood. This one and the same Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son <del>of God</del> must
be confessed to be in two natures,287 unconfusedly, immutably, indivisibly, inseparably
<del>united</del>, and that without the distinction of natures being taken away by such union, but
rather the peculiar property of each nature being preserved and being united in one Person
and subsistence, not separated or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son and
only-begotten, God the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, as the Prophets of old time have spoken
concerning him, and as the Lord Jesus Christ hath taught us, and as the Creed of the Fathers
hath delivered to us.</p>
<p>These things, therefore, having been expressed by us with the greatest accuracy and attention,
the holy Ecumenical Synod defines that no one shall be suffered to bring forward
a different faith (ἑτέραν πίστιν), nor to write, nor to put together, nor to excogitate, nor to
teach it to others. But such as dare either to put together another faith, or to bring forward
or to teach or to deliver a different Creed (ἕτερον σύμβολον) to as wish to be converted to
the knowledge of the truth, from the Gentiles, or Jews or any heresy whatever, if they be
Bishops or clerics let them be deposed, the Bishops from the Episcopate, and the clerics
from the clergy; but if they be monks or laics: let them be anathematized.</p>
<p>After the reading of the definition, all the most religious Bishops cried out: This is the
faith of the fathers: let the metropolitans forthwith subscribe it: let them forthwith, in the
presence of the judges, subscribe it: let that which has been well defined have no delay: this
is the faith of the Apostles: by this we all stand: thus we all believe.</p>

sought him not, and even to them that asked not for him. And although some from the
beginning contentiously made opposition, he shewed forth nevertheless his truth and so
disposed things that an unanimous and uncontradicted writing was published by us all,
which confirmed the souls of the stable, and inviting to the way of truth all who had declined
therefrom. And when we had subscribed with unanimous consent the chart, we all with
one consent, that is our whole synod, entered the martyry of the most holy and triumphant
martyr Euphemia, and when at the prayer of our most pious and beloved of Christ Emperor
Marcian, and of our most pious and in all respects faithful Empress, our daughter and Augusta
Pulcheria, with joy, and hilarity we placed upon the holy altar the decision which we
had written for the confirmation of the faith of our fathers in accordance with that holy
letter you sent us; and then handed it to their piety, that they might receive it as they had
asked for it. And when they had received it they gave glory with us to Christ the Lord, who
had driven away the darkness of wicked opinion, and had illustrated with the greatest unanimity
the word of truth, etc.</p>
<p>From this passage can easily be understood the very obscure passage in the letter of the
Council to Leo, where it says that the definition was delivered by St. Euphemia as her own
confession of faith. Vide note of the Ballerini on this epistle of Anatolius.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>(Hist. of the Councils. Vol. III., p. 348.)</p>
<p>The present Greek text has ἐκ δύο φύσεων while the old Latin translation has, in duabus
naturis. After what had been repeatedly said in this session on the difference between “in
two natures” and “of two natures,” and in opposition to the latter formula, there can be no
doubt whatever that the old Latin translator had the more accurate text before him, and
that it was originally ἐν δύο φύσεσιν. This, however, is not mere supposition, but is expressly
testified by antiquity: (1) by the famous Abbot Euthymius of Palestine, a contemporary of
the Council of Chalcedon, of whose disciples several were present as bishops at our Council
(cf. Baron. ad. ann. 451, n. 152 sq.). We still have a judgment of his which he gave respecting
the decree of Chalcedon concerning the faith, and in which he repeats the leading doctrine
in the words of the Synod itself. At our passage he remarks: ἐν δύο φύσεσι γνωρίζεσθαι
ὁμολογεῖ τὸν ἕνα Χριστὸν κ.τ.λ. The fragment of his writings on the subject is found in
the Vita S. Euthymii Abbatis, written by his pupil Cyril in the Analecta Græca of the monks
of St. Maur, t. i., p. 57, printed in Mansi, t. vii., p. 774 sq. (2) The second ancient witness is
Severus, from a.d. 513 Monophysite patriarch of Antioch, who represents it as a great reproach
and an unpardonable offence in the fathers of Chalcedon that they had declared:

<pb n="519"/>
ἐν δύο φύσεσιν ἀδιαιρέτοις γνωρίζεσθαι τον Χριστὸν (see the Sententiæ Severi in Mansi, t.
vii., p. 839). (3) Somewhat more than a hundred years after the Council of Chalcedon,
Evagrius copied its decree concerning the faith in extenso into his Church History (lib. ii.,
4), and, in fact, with the words: ἐν δύο φύσεσιν ἀσυγχύτως κ.τ.λ. (ed. Mog., p. 294). (4) In
the conference on religion held between the Severians and the orthodox at Constantinople,
a.d. 553, the former reproached the Synod of Chalcedon with having put in duabus naturis,
instead of ex duabus naturis, as Cyril and the old fathers had taught (Mansi, t. viii., p. 892;
Hardouin, t. ii., p. 1162). (5) Leontius of Byzantium maintains quite distinctly, in the year
610, in his work De Sectis, that the Synod taught ἕνα Χριστὸν ἐν δύο φύτεσιν ὰσυγχύτως
κ.τ.λ.</p>
<p>It is clear that if any doubt had then existed as to the correct reading, Leontius could
not have opposed the Monophysites with such certainty. The passage adduced by him is
Actio iv., c. 7., in Galland. Bibliotheca PP., t. xii., p. 633. Gieseler (Kirchengesch. i., S. 465),
and after him Hahn (Biblioth. der Symbole, S. 118, note 6), cites incorrectly the fourth instead
of the fifth Actio. Perhaps neither of them had consulted the passage itself. (6) No less
weight is to be attached to the fact that all the Latin translations, that of Rusticus and those
before him, have in duabus naturis; and (7) that the Lateran Synod, a.d. 649, had the same
reading in their Acts (Hardouin, t. iii., p. 835). (8) Pope Agatho, also, in his letter to the
Emperor Constans II., which was read in the sixth Ecumenical Synod, adduced the creed
of Chalcedon with the words in duabus naturis (in the Acts of the sixth Ecumenical Council,
Actio iv.; in Mansi, t. xi., p. 256; Hardouin, t. iii., p. 1091). In consequence of this, most
scholars of recent times, e.g., Tillemont, Walch (Bibloth. symbol veter., p. 106), Hahn (l. c.),
Gieseler (l. c.), Neander (Abthl. ii., 2 of Bd. iv., S. 988), have declared ἐν δύο φύσεσιν to be
the original and correct reading. Neander adds: “The whole process of the transactions of
the Council shows this (that ἐν δύο is the correct reading). Evidently the earlier creed, which
was more favourable to the Egyptian doctrine, contained the ἐκ δύο φύσεων and the favour
shown to the other party came out chiefly in the change of the ἐκ into ἐν. The expression
ἐκ δύο φύσεων besides, does not fit the place, the verb γνωριζόμενον points rather to the
original ἐν. The ἐν δύο φύσεσιν or ἐκ δύο φύσεων was the turning-point of the whole
controversy between Monophysitism and Dyophysitism.” Cf., on the other side, Baur,
Trinitätslehre, Bd. i., S. 820, and Dorner (Lehre v. der Person Christi, Thl. ii., S. 129), where
it is maintained that ἐκ is the correct and original reading, but that it was from the beginning
purposely altered by the Westerns into in; moreover, that ἐκ fits better than ἐν with
γνωριζόμενον, and therefore that it had been allowed as a concession to the Monophysites.
The meaning, moreover, they say, of ἐκ and ἐν is essentially the same, and the one and the
other alike excluded Monophysitism.</p>

<head>The Decree with Regard to the Bishop of Ephesus.</head>
<head>Session XII.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 706.)</p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: Since the proposition of the God-beloved archbishop
of royal Constantinople, Anatolius, and of the most reverend bishop Paschasinus, holding
the place of Leo, the most God-beloved archbishop of old Rome, which orders that because
both of them [i.e., Bassianus and Stephen] acted uncanonically, neither of them should rule,
nor be called bishop of the most holy church of Ephesus, and since the whole holy synod
taught that uncanonically they had performed these ordinations, and had agreed with the
speeches of the most reverend bishops; the most reverend Bassianus and the most reverend
Stephen will be removed from the holy church of Ephesus; but they shall enjoy the episcopal
dignity, and from the revenues of the before-mentioned most holy church, for their nourishment
and consolation, they shall receive each year two hundred gold pieces; and another
bishop shall be ordained according to the canons for the most holy church.288</p>
<p>And the whole holy synod cried out: This is a just sentence. This is a pious scheme.</p>
<p>These things are fair to look upon.</p>
<p>The most reverend bishop Bassianus said: Pray give order that what was stolen from
me be restored.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: If anything belonging to the most reverend bishop
Bassianus personally has been taken from him, either by the most reverend bishop Stephen,
or by any other persons whatsoever, this shall be restored, after judicial proof, by them who
took it away or caused it to be taken.</p>
<note type="footnote">288 The English translation of Hefele asserts twice (Hist. of the Councils, Vol. III., pp. 173 and 376), that
Bassianus was “deposed.” This is entirely a mistake, he was deprived of his diocese, but retained his episcopal

<head>Decree with Regard to Nicomedia.</head>
<head>Session XIII.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 715.)</p>
<p>The most glorious judges said <del>after the reading of the imperial letters was finished</del>:
These divine letters say nothing whatever with regard to the episcopate, but both refer to
honour belonging to metropolitan cities. But the sacred letters of Valentinian and Valens
of divine memory, which then bestowed metropolitan rights upon the city of Nice, carefully
provided that nothing should be taken away from other cities. And the canon of the holy
fathers decreed that there should be one metropolis in each province. What therefore is the
pleasure of the holy synod in this matter?</p>
<p>The holy synod cried out: Let the canons be kept. Let the canons be sufficient.</p>
<p>Atticus the most reverend bishop of old Nicopolis in Epirus said: The canon thus
defines, that a metropolitan should have jurisdiction in each province, and he should constitute
all the bishops who are in that province. And this is the meaning of the canon. Now
the bishop of Nicomedia, since from the beginning this was a metropolis, ought to ordain
all the bishops who are in that province.</p>
<p>The holy synod said: This is what we all wish, this we all pray for, let this everywhere
be observed, this is pleasing to all of us.</p>
<p>John, Constantine, Patrick <del>Peter</del> and the rest of the most reverend bishops of the
Pontic diocese <del>through John who was one of them</del> said: The canons recognize the one
more ancient as the metropolitan. And it is manifest that the most religious bishop of
Nicomedia has the right of the ordination, and since the laws (as your magnificence has
seen) have honoured Nice with the name only of metropolis, and so made its bishop superior
to the rest of the bishops of the province in honour only.</p>
<p>The holy synod said: They have taught in accordance with the canons, beautifully have
they taught. We all say the same things.</p>
<p><del>Aëtius, Archdeacon of Constantinople, then put in a plea to save the rights of the throne
of the royal city.</del></p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: The most reverend the bishop of Nicomedia shall have
the authority of metropolitan over the churches of the province of Bithynia, and Nice shall
have the honour only of Metropolitical rank, submitting itself according to the example of
the other bishops of the province of Nicomedia. For such is the pleasure of the Holy Synod.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</p>
<p>The canons of every Synod of the holy Fathers shall be observed.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Before the holding of the Council of Chalcedon, in the Greek Church, the canons of
several synods, which were held previously, were gathered into one collection and provided
with continuous numbers, and such a collection of canons, as we have seen, lay before the
Synod of Chalcedon. As, however, most of the synods whose canons were received into the
collection, e.g. those of Neocæsarea, Ancyra, Gangra, Antioch, were certainly not Ecumenical
Councils, and were even to some extent of doubtful authority, such as the Antiochene
Synod of 341, the confirmation of the Ecumenical Synod was now given to them, in order
to raise them to the position of universally and unconditionally valid ecclesiastical rules. It
is admirably remarked by the Emperor Justinian, in his 131st Novel, cap. j.; “We honour
the doctrinal decrees of the first four Councils as we do Holy Scripture, but the canons given
or approved by them as we do the laws.”</p>
<p>It seems quite impossible to determine just what councils are included in this list, the
Council in Trullo has entirely removed this ambiguity in its second canon.</p>

<p>If any Bishop should ordain for money, and put to sale a grace which cannot be sold,
and for money ordain a bishop, or chorepiscopus, or presbyters, or deacons, or any other
of those who are counted among the clergy; or if through lust of gain he should nominate
for money a steward, or advocate, or prosmonarius, or any one whatever who is on the roll
of the Church, let him who is convicted of this forfeit his own rank; and let him who is ordained
be nothing profited by the purchased ordination or promotion; but let him be removed
from the dignity or charge he has obtained for money. And if any one should be
found negotiating such shameful and unlawful transactions, let him also, if he is a clergyman,
be deposed from his rank, and if he is a layman or monk, let him be anathematized.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</p>
<p>Whoso buys or sells an ordination, down to a Prosmonarius, shall be in danger of losing
his grade. Such shall also be the case with go-betweens, if they be clerics they shall be cut off
from their rank, if laymen or monks, they shall be anathematized.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>A great scandal in the “Asian diocese” had led to St. Chrysostom’s intervention. Antoninus,
bishop of Ephesus, was charged, with “making it a rule to sell ordinations of bishops
at rates proportionate to the value of their sees” (Palladius, Dial. de vita Chrysost., p. 50).
Chrysostom held a synod at Ephesus, at which six bishops were deposed for having obtained
their sees in this manner. Isidore of Pelasium repeatedly remonstrated with his bishop Eusebius
on the heinousness of “selling the gift” of ordinations (Epist. I., 26, 30, 37); and names
Zosimus, a priest, and Maron, a deacon, as thus ordained (ib. 111, 119). A few years before
the council, a court of three bishops sat at Berytus to hear charges brought against Ibas,
bishop of Edessa, by clerics of his diocese. The third charge was thus curtly worded:
“Moreover he receives for laying on hands” (Mansi, vii. 224). The xxvijth Trullan canon
repeated this canon of Chalcedon against persons ordained for money, doubtless in view
of such a state of things as Gregory the Great had heard of nearly a century earlier, “that in
the Eastern Churches no one comes to holy order except by the payment of premiums”
(Epist. xi. 46, to the bishop of Jerusalem; compare Evagrius’s assertion that Justin II. openly
sold bishoprics, V. 1). It is easy to understand how the scruples of ecclesiastics could be
abated by the courtly fashion of calling bribes “eulogiæ” (Fleury, XXVI, 20), just as the six
prelates above referred to had regarded their payments as an equivalent for that “making

<pb n="526"/>
over of property to the Curia,” which was required by a law of 399 (Cod. Theod., xii. 1, 163,
see notes in Transl. of Fleury, i. 163, ij. 16).</p>
<p>The ἔκδικος, “defensor,” was an official Advocate or counsel for the Church. The legal
force of the term “defensor” is indicated by a law of Valentinian I. “Nec idem in eodem negotio
defensor sit et quæsitor” (Cod. Theod., ii. 10, 2). In the East the office was held by
ecclesiastics; thus, John, presbyter and “advocate” was employed, at the Council of Constantinople
in 448, to summon Eutyches (Mansi, vii. 697). About 496, Paul the “Advocate”
of Constantinople saved his archbishop from the sword of a murderer at the cost of his own
life (Theodor., Lect. ii. 11). In the list of the functionaries of St. Sophia, given by Goar in
his Euchologion (p. 270), the Protecdicos is discribed as adjudicating, with twelve assessors,
in smaller causes, on which he afterwards reports to the bishop. In Africa, on the other
hand, from a.d. 407 (see Cod. Theod., xvi. 2, 38), the office was held by barristers, in accordance
with a request of the African bishops (Cod. Afric., 97; Mansi, iii., 802), who, six years
earlier, had asked for “defensores,” with special reference to the oppression of the poor by
the rich (Cod. Afric., 75; Mansi, iii. 778, 970). The “defensores” mentioned by Gregory the
Great had primarily to take care of the poor (Epist., v. 29), and of the church property (ib.,
i. 36), but also to be advocates of injured clerics (ib., ix. 64) and act as assessors (ib., x. 1),
etc.</p>
<p>The next office is that of the Prosmonarius or, according to a various reading adopted
by many (e.g. Justellus, Hervetus, Beveridge, Bingham), the Paramonarius. Opinions differ
as to the functions intended. Isidore gives simply “paramonarius:” Dionysius (see Justellus,
Biblioth., i., 134) omits the word; but in the “interpretatio Dionysii,” as given in the Concilia,
freedom has been taken to insert “vel mansionarium” in a parenthesis (vii. 373; see Beveridge,
in loc.). Mansionarius is a literal rendering; but what was the function of a mansionarius?
In Gregory the Great’s time he was a sacristan who had the duty of lighting the church (Dial.,
i. 5); and “ostiarium” in the Prisca implies the same idea. Tillemont, without deciding
between the two Greek readings, thinks that the person intended had “some charge of what
pertained to the church itself, perhaps like our present bedells” (xv. 694). So Fleury renders,
“concièrge” (xxviij. 29); and Newman, reading “paramonarion,” takes a like view (note in
Transl. of Fleury, vol. iii., p. 392). But Justellus (i. 91) derives “paramonarius” from μονή
“mansio,” a halting-place, so that the sense would be a manager of one of the church’s farms,
a “villicus,” or, as Bingham expresses it, “a bailiff” (iii. 3, 1). Beveridge agrees with Justellus,
except in giving to μονή the sense of “monastery” (compare the use of μονή in Athan., Apol.
c. Arian, 67, where Valesius understands it as “a station” on a road, but others as “a monastery,”
see Historical Writings of St. Athanasius, Introd., p. xliv.). Bingham also prefers this
interpretation. Suicer takes it as required by “paramonarios” which he treats as the true
reading: “prosmonarios” he thinks would have the sense of “sacristan.”</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>

<pb n="527"/>
<p>According to Van Espen, however, who here supports himself upon Du Cange, by
“prosmonarios” or “mansionarius,” in the same way as by “oiconomos,” a steward of church
property was to be understood.</p>

<head>Canon III.</head>
<p>It has come to <del>the knowledge of</del> the holy Synod that certain of those who are enrolled
among the clergy have, through lust of gain, become hirers of other men’s possessions, and
make contracts pertaining to secular affairs, lightly esteeming the service of God, and slip
into the houses of secular persons, whose property they undertake through covetousness
to manage. Wherefore the great and holy Synod decrees that henceforth no bishop, clergyman,
nor monk shall hire possessions, or engage in business, or occupy himself in worldly
engagements, unless he shall be called by the law to the guardianship of minors, from which
there is no escape; or unless the bishop of the city shall commit to him the care of ecclesiastical
business, or of unprovided orphans or widows and of persons who stand especially in
need of the Church’s help, through the fear of God. And if any one shall hereafter transgress
these decrees, he shall be subjected to ecclesiastical penalties.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>Those who assume the care of secular houses should be corrected, unless perchance the
law called them to the administration of those not yet come of age, from which there is no
exemption. Unless further their Bishop permits them to take care of orphans and widows.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>These two cases excepted, the undertaking of secular business was made ecclesiastically
penal. Yet this is not to be construed as forbidding clerics to work at trades either (1) when
the church-funds were insufficient to maintain them, or (2) in order to have more to bestow
in alms, or (3) as an example of industry or humility. Thus, most of the clergy of Cæsarea
in Cappadocia practised sedentary trades for a livelihood (Basil, Epist., cxcviii., 1); and some
African canons allow, or even direct, a cleric to live by a trade, provided that his clerical
duties are not neglected (Mansi, iii., 955). At an earlier time Spyridion, the famous Cypriot
bishop, still one of the most popular saints in the Levant (Stanley’s East. Church, p. 126),
retained, out of humility (ἀτυφιαν πολλήν, Soc. i. 12), his occupation as a shepherd; and
in the latter part of the fourth century Zeno, bishop of Maiuma, wove linen, partly to supply
his own wants, and partly to obtain means of helping the poor (Soz., vii. 28). Sidonius
mentions a “reader” who maintained himself by commercial transactions (Epist., vi. 8), and
in the Anglo-Saxon Church, although presbyters were forbidden to become “negotiorum
sæcularium dispositores” (Cl. of Clovesho in 747, c. 8), or to be “mongers and covetous
merchants” (Elfric’s canons, xxx.), yet the canons of King Edgar’s reign ordered every priest

<pb n="529"/>
“diligently to learn a handicraft” (No. 11; Wilkins, i. 225). In short, it was not the mere fact
of secular employment, but secularity of motive and of tone that was condemned.</p>

Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I. Dist. lxxxvi., C. xxvj.</p>

<p>Let those who truly and sincerely lead the monastic life be counted worthy of becoming
honour; but, forasmuch as certain persons using the pretext of monasticism bring confusion
both upon the churches and into political affairs by going about promiscuously in the cities,
and at the same time seeking to establish Monasteries for themselves; it is decreed that no
one anywhere build or found a monastery or oratory contrary to the will of the bishop of
the city; and that the monks in every city and district shall be subject to the bishop, and
embrace a quiet course of life, and give themselves only to fasting and prayer, remaining
permanently in the places in which they were set apart; and they shall meddle neither in
ecclesiastical nor in secular affairs, nor leave their own monasteries to take part in such;
unless, indeed, they should at any time through urgent necessity be appointed thereto by
the bishop of the city. And no slave shall be received into any monastery to become a monk
against the will of his master. And if any one shall transgress this our judgment, we have
decreed that he shall be excommunicated, that the name of God be not blasphemed. But
the bishop of the city must make the needful provision for the monasteries.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</p>
<p>Domestic oratories and monasteries are not to be erected contrary to the judgment of the
bishop. Every monk must be subject to his bishop, and must not leave his house except at his
suggestion. A slave, however, can not enter the monastic life without the consent of his master.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Like the previous canon, this one was brought forward by the Emperor Marcian in the
sixth session, and then as number one, and the synod accepted the Emperor’s proposed
canon almost verbally. Occasion for this canon seems to have been given by monks of Eutychian
tendencies, and especially by the Syrian Barsumas, as appears from the fourth session.
He and his monks had, as Eutychians, withdrawn themselves from the jurisdiction of their
bishops, whom they suspected of Nestorianism.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>Here observe (1) the definite assertion of episcopal authority over monks, as it is repeated
for greater clearness in the last words of the canon, which are not found in Marcian’s draft,
“It is the duty of the bishop of the city to make due provision for the monasteries,” and
compare canons 8, 24. Isidore says that the bishop must “keep an eye on the negligences
of monks” (Epist., i. 149). The Western Church followed in this track (see Council of Agde,

<p>It is supposed by Hefele that the bishops were thinking of the case of Bassian, who, in
the eleventh session (Oct. 29), pleaded that he had been violently ejected from the see of
Ephesus. Stephen the actual bishop, answered that Bassian had not been “ordained” for
that see, but had invaded it and been justly expelled. Bassian rejoined that his original
consecration for the see of Evasa had been forcible even to brutality; that he had never even
visited Evasa, that therefore his appointment to Ephesus was not a translation. Ultimately,
the Council cut the knot by ordering that a new bishop should be elected, Basalan and
Stephen retaining the episcopal title and receiving allowances from the revenues of the see
(Mansi, vii. 273 et seqq.)</p>

<head>Canon VI.</head>
<p>Neither presbyter, deacon, nor any of the ecclesiastical order shall be ordained at large,
nor unless the person ordained is particularly appointed to a church in a city or village, or
to a martyry, or to a monastery. And if any have been ordained without a charge, the holy
Synod decrees, to the reproach of the ordainer, that such an ordination shall be inoperative,
and that such shall nowhere be suffered to officiate.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>In Martyries and Monasteries ordinations are strictly forbidden. Should any one be ordained
therein, his ordination shall be reputed of no effect.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The wording of the canon seems to intimate that the synod of Chalcedon held ordinations
of this sort to be not only illicit but also invalid, irritis and cassis. Nor is this to be wondered
at, if we take into account the pristine and ancient discipline of the church and the opinion
of many of the Scholastics (Morinus, De SS. Ordinat., Parte III., Exercit. V., cap. ix.).</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>It is clear that our canon forbids the so-called absolute ordinations, and requires that
every cleric must at the time of his ordination be designated to a definite church. The only
titulus which is here recognized is that which was later known as titulus beneficii. As various
kinds of this title we find here (a) the appointment to a church in the city; (b) to a village
church; (c) that to the chapel of a martyr; (d) the appointment as chaplain of a monastery.
For the right understanding of the last point, it must be remembered that the earliest monks
were in no wise clerics, but that soon the custom was introduced in every larger convent,
of having at least one monk ordained presbyter, that he might provide for divine service in
the monastery.</p>
<p>Similar prohibitions of ordinationes absolutæ were also put forth in after times.</p>
<p>According to existing law, absolute ordinations, as is well known, are still illicitæ, but
yet validæ, and even the Council of Chalcedon has not declared them to be properly invalidæ,
but only as without effect (by permanent suspension). Cf. Kober, Suspension, S. 220, and
Hergenröther, Photius, etc., Bd. ii., S. 324.</p>

<p>By the word μαρτυρίῳ (“martyry”) is meant a church or chapel raised over a martyr’s
grave. So the Laodicene Council forbids Churchmen to visit the “martyries of heretics”
(can. ix.). So Gregory of Nyssa speaks of “the martyry” of the Holy Martyrs (Op. ii., 212);
Chrysostom of a “martyry,” and Palladius of “martyries” near Antioch (In Act. Apost. Hom.,
xxxviii. 5; Dial., p. 17), and Palladius of “the martyry of St. John” at Constantinople (Dial.,
p. 25). See Socrates, iv. 18, 23, on the “martyry” of St. Thomas at Edessa, and that of SS.
Peter and Paul at Rome; and vi. 6, on the “martyry” of St. Euphenia at Chalcedon in which
the Council actually met. In the distinct sense of a visible testimony, the word was applied
to the church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem (Eusebius, Vit. Con., iii. 40, iv. 40; Mansi, vi.
564; Cyril, Catech., xiv. 3), and to the Holy Sepulchre itself (Vit. Con., iii. 28). Churches
raised over martyrs’ tombs were called in the West “memoriæ martyrum,” see Cod. Afric.,
lxxxiii. (compare Augustine, De Cura pro Mortuis, VI.).</p>

<p>We have decreed that those who have once been enrolled among the clergy, or have
been made monks, shall accept neither a military charge nor any secular dignity; and if they
shall presume to do so and not repent in such wise as to turn again to that which they had

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</p>
<p>If any cleric or monk arrogantly affects the military or any other dignity, let him be cursed.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Something similar was ordered by the lxxxiii. (lxxxii.) Apostolic Canon, only that it
threatens the cleric who takes military service merely with deposition from his clerical office,
while our canon subjects him to excommunication.…The Greek commentators, Balsamon
and Zonaras, think that our canon selects a more severe punishment, that of excommunication,
because it has in view those clerics who have not merely taken military service, etc.,
but at the same time have laid aside their clerical dress and put on secular clothing.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>By στρατείαν <del>which I have translated (or, as Canon Bright thinks, mistranslated)
“military charge”</del>, “militiam,” is here meant, not military employment as such, but the
public service in general. This use of the term is a relic and token of the military basis of
the Roman monarchy. The court of the Imperator was called his camp, στρατόπεδον (Cod.
Theod., tom. ii., p. 22), as in Constantine’s letter’s to John Archaph and the Council of Tyre
(Athan., Apol. c. Ari., lxx. 86), and in the VIIth canon of Sardica, so Athanasius speaks of
the “camp” of Constans (Apol. ad Constant, iv. ), and of that of Constantius at Milan (Hist.
Ari., xxxvij.); so Hosius uses the same phrase in his letter to Constantius (ib. xliv.); so the
Semi-Arian bishops, when addressing Jovian (Soz., vi. 4); so Chrysostom in the reign of
Theodosius I. (Hom. ad Pop. Antioch, vi. 2). Similarly, there were officers of the palace
called Castrensians (Tertull., De Cor., 12), as being “milites alius generis—de imperatoria
familia” (Gothofred, Cod. Theod., tom. ii., p. 526). So στρατεύσθαι is used for holding a
place at court, as in Soc., iv. 9; Soz., vi. 9, on Marcian’s case, and a very clear passage in Soc.,
v. 25, where the verb is applied to an imperial secretary. It occurs in combination with
στρατεία in a petition of an Alexandrian deacon named Theodore, which was read in the
third session of Chalcedon: he says, “᾽Εστρατευσάμεν for about twenty-two years in the
Schola of the magistrians” (under the Magister officionum, or chief magistrate of the palace),

<pb n="536"/>
“but I disregarded στρατείας τοσούτον χρόναυ in order to enter the ministry” (Mansi, vi.
1008). See also Theodoret, Relig. Hist., xij., on the emperor’s letter-carriers. In the same
sense Honorius, by a law of 408, forbids non-Catholics “intra palatium militare” (Cod
Theod., xvi., 5, 42); and the Vandal king Hunneric speaks of “domus nostræ militiæ” (Victor
Vitens, iv. 2).</p>

<p>Any clergyman in an almshouse or monastery must submit himself to the authority of
the bishop of the city. But he who rebels against this let him pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>From this canon we learn that the synod of Chalcedon willed that all who were in charge
of such pious institutions should be subject to the bishop, and in making this decree the
synod only followed the tradition of the Fathers and Canons. Although in its first part the
canon only mentions “clergymen,” yet in the second part monks are named, and, as Balsamon
and Zonoras point out, both are included.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>What a πτωχεῖον was may be seen from what Gibbon calls the “noble and charitable
foundation, almost a new city” (iii. 252), established by St. Basil at a little distance from
Cæsarea, and called in consequence the Basiliad. Gregory Nazianzen describes it as a large
set of buildings with rooms for the sick, especially for lepers, and also for house-less travellers;
“a storehouse of piety, where disease was borne philosophically, and sympathy was tested”
(Orat., xliii., 63, compare Basil himself, Epist., xciv., on its staff of nurses and physicians and
cl., 3). Sozomen calls it “a most celebrated resting-place for the poor,” and names Prapidius
as having been its warden while acting as “bishop over many villages” (vi. 34, see on Nic.,
viij.). Another πτωχοτροφεῖον is mentioned by Basil (Epist., cxliij.) as governed by a
chorepiscopus.</p>
<p>St. Chrysostom, on coming to the see of Constantinople, ordered the excess of episcopal
expenditure to be transferred to the hospital for the sick (νοσοκομεῖον ), and “founded
other such hospitals, setting over them two pious presbyters, with physicians and cooks.…so
that foreigners arriving in the city, on being attacked by disease, might receive aid, both
because it was a good work in itself, and for the glory of the Saviour” (Palladius, Dial., p.
19). At Ephesus Bassian founded a πτωχεῖτον with seventy pallets for the sick (Mansi, vii.,

<pb n="538"/>
277), and there were several such houses in Egypt (ib., vi., 1013; in the next century there
was a hospital for the sick at Daphne near Antioch (Evagr., iv., 35). “The tradition of the
holy fathers” is here cited as barring any claim on the part of clerics officiating in these institutions,
or in monasteries or martyries, to be exempt from the jurisdiction of the ordinary.
They are to “abide under it,” and not to indulge selfwill by “turning restive” against their
bishop’s authority” (ἀφηνιάζω is literally to get the bit between the teeth, and is used by
Aëtius for “not choosing to obey,” Mansi, vii., 72). Those who dare to violate this clearly
defined rule (διατύωσιν, comp. τύπος in Nic., xix.), and to refuse subjection to their own
bishop, are, if clerics, to incur canonical censure, if monks or laics, to be excommunicated.
The allusion to laics points to laymen as founders or benefactors of such institutions.</p>

<p>If any Clergyman have a matter against another clergyman, he shall not forsake his

or let the matter be submitted to any person whom each of the parties may, with the Bishop’s
consent, select. And if any one shall contravene these decrees, let him be subjected to canonical
penalties. And if a clergyman have a complaint against his own or any other bishop,
let it be decided by the synod of the province. And if a bishop or clergyman should have a
difference with the metropolitan of the province, let him have recourse to the Exarch of the
Diocese, or to the throne of the Imperial City of Constantinople, and there let it be tried.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</p>
<p>Litigious clerics shall be punished according to canon, if they despise the episcopal and
resort to the secular tribunal. When a cleric has a contention with a bishop let him wait till
the synod sits, and if a bishop have a contention with his metropolitan let him carry the case
to Constantinople.</p>
<p>Johnson.</p>
<p>Let the reader observe that here is a greater privilege given by a General Council to the
see of Constantinople than ever was given by any council, even that of Sardica, to the bishop
of Rome, viz., that any bishop or clergyman might at the first instance bring his cause before
the bishop of Constantinople if the defendant were a metropolitan.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>That our canon would refer not merely the ecclesiastical, but the civil differences of the
clergy, in the first case, to the bishop, is beyond a doubt. And it comes out as clearly from
the word πρότερον (= at first) that it does not absolutely exclude a reference to the secular
judges, but regards it as allowable only when the first attempt at an adjustment of the controversy
by the bishop has miscarried. This was quite clearly recognized by Justinian in his
123d Novel, c. 21: “If any one has a case against a cleric, or a monk, or a deaconess, or a
nun, or an ascetic, he shall first make application to the bishop of his opponent, and he shall
decide. If both parties are satisfied with his decision, it shall then be carried into effect by
the imperial judge of the locality. If, however, one of the contending parties lodges an appeal
against the bishop’s judgment within ten days, then the imperial judge of the locality shall
decide the matter. There is no doubt that the expression “Exarch” employed in our canon,
and also in canon 17, means, in the first place, those superior metropolitans who have sev-

<pb n="540"/>
eral ecclesiastical provinces under them. Whether, however, the great patriarchs, properly
so called, are to be included under it, may be doubted. The Emperor Justinian, in c. 22 of
his Novel just quoted (l. c.) in our text has, without further explanation, substituted the expression
Patriarch for Exarch, and in the same way the commentator Aristenus has declared
both terms to be identical, adding that only the Patriarch of Constantinople has the privilege
of having a metropolitan tried before him who does not belong to his patriarchate, but is
subject to another patriarch. In the same way our canon was understood by Beveridge.
Van Espen, on the contrary, thinks that the Synod had here in view only the exarchs in the
narrower sense (of Ephesus, Cæsarea), but not the Patriarchs, properly so called, of Rome,
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, as it would be too great a violation of the ancient canons,
particularly of the 6th of Nicæa, to have set aside the proper patriarch and have allowed an
appeal to the Bishop of Constantinople (with this Zonaras also agrees in his explanation of
canon 17). Least of all, however, would the Synod have made such a rule for the West, i.e.,
have allowed that any one should set aside the Patriarch of Rome and appeal to the Patriarch
of Constantinople, since they themselves, in canon 28, assigned the first place in rank to
Rome.</p>
<p>It appears to me that neither Beveridge, etc., nor Van Espen are fully in the right, while
each is partially so. With Van Espen we must assume that our Synod, in drawing up this
canon, had in view only the Greek Church, and not the Latin as well, particularly as neither
the papal legates nor any Latin bishop whatever was present at the drawing up of these
canons. On the other hand, Beveridge is also right in maintaining that the Synod made no
distinction between the patriarchs proper and the exarchs (such a distinction must otherwise
have been indicated in the text), and allowed that quarrels which should arise among the
bishops of other patriarchates might be tried at Constantinople. Only that Beveridge ought
to have excepted the West and Rome.</p>
<p>The strange part of our canon may be explained in the following manner. There were
always many bishops at Constantinople from the most different places, who came there to
lay their contentions and the like before the Emperor. The latter frequently referred the
decision to the bishop of Constantinople, who then, in union with the then present bishops
from the most different provinces, held a “Home Synod” and gave the sentence required at
this. Thus gradually the practice was formed of controversies being decided by bishops of
other patriarchates or exarchates at Constantinople, to the setting aside of the proper superior
metropolitan, an example of which we have seen in that famous Synod of Constantinople,
a.d. 448, at which the case of Eutyches was the first time brought forward.</p>

<p>It shall not be lawful for a clergyman to be at the same time enrolled in the churches of
two cities, that is, in the church in which he was at first ordained, and in another to which,
because it is greater, he has removed from lust of empty honour. And those who do so shall
be returned to their own church in which they were originally ordained, and there only shall
they minister. But if any one has heretofore been removed from one church to another, he
shall not intermeddle with the affairs of his former church, nor with the martyries, almshouses,
and hostels belonging to it. And if, after the decree of this great and ecumenical
Synod, any shall dare to do any of these things now forbidden, the synod decrees that he
shall be degraded from his rank.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>

<p>No cleric shall be recorded on the clergy-list of the churches of two cities. But if he shall
have strayed forth, let him be returned to his former place. But if he has been transferred, let
him have no share in the affairs of his former church.</p>
<p>Van Espen, following Christian Lupus, remarks that this canon is opposed to pluralities.
For if a clergyman has by presentation and institution obtained two churches, he is enrolled
in two churches at the same time, contrary to this canon; but surely that this be the case,
the two churches must needs be in two cities, and that, in the days of Chalcedon, meant in
two dioceses.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>Here a new institution comes into view, of which there were many instances. Julian
had directed Pagan hospices (ξενοδοχεῖα ) to be established on the Christian model (Epist.
xlix.). The Basiliad at Cæsarea was a ξενοδοχεῖον as well as a πτωχεῖον; it contained
καταγώγια τοῖς ξένοις, as well as for wayfayers, and those who needed assistance on account
of illness, and Basil distinguished various classes of persons engaged in charitable ministrations,
including those who escorted the traveller on his way (τοὺς παραπέμποντας , Epist.
xciv.). Jerome writes to Pammachius: “I hear that you have made a ‘xenodochion’ in the
port of Rome,” and adds that he himself had built a “diversorium” for pilgrims to Bethlehem
(Epist. xvi., 11, 14). Chrysostom reminds his auditors at Constantinople that “there is a
common dwelling set apart by the Church,” and “called a xenon” (in Act. Hom., xlv. 4). His
friend Olympias was munificent to “xenotrophia” (Hist. Lausiac, 144). There was a xenodo-

<pb n="542"/>
chion near the church of the monastic settlement at Nitria (ib., 7). Ischyrion, in his memorial
read in the 3d session of Chalcedon, complains of his patriarch Dioscorus for having misapplied
funds bequeathed by a charitable lady τοῖς ξενεῶσι καὶ πτωχείοις in Egypt, and says
that he himself had been confined by Dioscorus in a “xenon” for lepers (Mansi, vi. 1013,
1017). Justinian mentions xenodochia in Cod., i. 3, 49, and their wardens in Novell., 134,
16. Gregory the Great orders that the accounts of xenodochia should be audited by the
bishop (Epist. iv., 27). Charles the Great provides for the restoration of decayed “senodochia”
(Capitul. of 803; Pertz, Leg., i. 110); and Alcuin exhorts his pupil, archbishop Eanbald, to
think where in the diocese of York he could establish “xenodochia, id est, hospitalia” (Epist.

<p>The mediaeval commentators, Balsamon, Zonaras, and Aristenus, understand this
canon to mean that letters of commendation, συστατικαὶ , commendatitiæ litteræ were given
to those laymen and clerics who were previously subject to ecclesiastical censure, and
therefore were suspected by other bishops, and for this reason needed a special recommendation,
in order to be received in another church into the number of the faithful. The letters
of peace (εἰρηνικαί) on the contrary, were given to those who were in undisturbed communion
with their bishop, and had not the least evil reputation abroad.</p>
<p>Our canon was understood quite differently by the old Latin writers, Dionysius Exiguus
and Isidore, who translate the words ἐν ὑπολήψει by personæ honoratiores and clariores,
and the learned Bishop Gabriel Aubespine of Orleans has endeavored to prove, in his notes
to our canon, that the litteræ pacificæ were given to ordinary believers, and the commendatitiæ
(συστατικαί) on the contrary, only to clerics and to distinguished laymen; and in favour
of this view is the xiii. canon of Chalcedon.</p>
<p>With regard to this much-vexed point, authorities are so divided that no absolute
judgment can be arrived at. The interpretation I have followed is that of the Greeks and of

Hervetus, which seems to be supported by Apostolic Canon XIII., and was that adopted by

<head>Canon XII.</head>
<p>It has come to our knowledge that certain persons, contrary to the laws of the Church,
having had recourse to secular powers, have by means of imperial rescripts divided one
Province into two, so that there are consequently two metropolitans in one province;
therefore the holy Synod has decreed that for the future no such thing shall be attempted
by a bishop, since he who shall undertake it shall be degraded from his rank. But the cities
which have already been honoured by means of imperial letters with the name of metropolis,
and the bishops in charge of them, shall take the bare title, all metropolitan rights being
preserved to the true Metropolis.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</p>
<p>One province shall not be cut into two. Whoever shall do this shall be cast out of the
episcopate. Such cities as are cut off by imperial rescript shall enjoy only the honour of having
a bishop settled in them: but all the rights pertaining to the true metropolis shall be preserved.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>We learn from this canon, there were cases in which an ambitious prelate, “by making
application to the government” (“secular powers”) had obtained what are called “pragmatic
letters,” and employed them for the purpose of “dividing one province into two,” and exalting
himself as a metropolitan. The name of a “pragmatic sanction” is more familiar in regard
to medieval and modern history; it recalls the name of St. Louis, and, still more, that of the
Emperor Charles VI. the father of Maria Theresa. Properly a “pragmatic” was a deliberate
order promulgated by the Emperor after full hearing of advice, on some public affair. We
find “pragmatici nostri statuta” in a law of a.d. 431. (Cod. Theod., xi. 1, 36); and “pragmatici
prioris,” “sub hac pragmatica jussione,” in ordinances in Append. to Cod. Theod., pp. 95,
162; and the empress Pulcheria, about a year before the Council, had informed Leo that her
husband Marcian had recalled some exiled orthodox bishops “robore pragmatici sui” (Leon.,
Epist. lxxvij.). Justinian speaks of “pragmaticas nostras formas” and “pragmaticum typum”
(Novel., 7, 9, etc.). The phrase was adopted from his legislation by Louis the Pious and his
colleague-son Lothar (compare Novel. 7, 2 with Pertz, Mon. Germ, Hist. Leg., i., 254), and
hence it came to be used both by later German emperors (see, e.g., Bryce’s Holy Roman
Empire, p. 212), and by the French kings (Kitchin, Hist. France, i. 343, 544). Augustine explains
it by “præceptum imperatoris” (Brev. Collat. cum Donatist. iii., 2), and Balsamon in
his comment uses an equivalent phrase; and so in the record of the fourth session of
Chalcedon we have θεῖα γράμματα (“divine” being practically equivalent to “imperial”) ex-

<pb n="546"/>
plained by πραγματικοὺς τύπους (Mansi, vii., 89). We must observe that the imperial order,
in the cases contemplated by the canon, had only conferred the title of “metropolis” on the
city, and had not professed to divide the province for civil, much less for ecclesiastical,
purposes. Valens, indeed, had divided the province of Cappadocia, when in 371 he made
Tyana a metropolis: and therefore Anthimus, bishop of Tyana, when he claimed the position
of a metropolitan, with authority over suffragans, was making a not unnatural inference in
regard to ecclesiastical limits from political rearrangements of territory, as Gregory of
Nazianzus says (Orat. xliii., 58), whereas Basil “held to the old custom,” i.e., to the traditional
unity of his provincial church, although after a while he submitted to what he could not
hinder (see Tillemont, ix., 175, 182, 670). But in the case of Eustathius of Berytus, which
was clearly in the Council’s mind, the Phoenician province had not been divided; it was in
reliance on a mere title bestowed upon his city, and also on an alleged synodical ordinance
which issued in fact from the so-called “Home Synod” that he declared himself independent
of his metropolitan, Photius of Tyre, and brought six bishoprics under his assumed jurisdiction.
Thus while the province remained politically one, he had de facto divided it ecclesiastically
into two. Photius petitioned Marcian, who referred the case to the Council of
Chalcedon, and it was taken up in the fourth session. The imperial commissioners announced
that it was to be settled not according to “pragmatic forms,” but according to those which
had been enacted by the Fathers (Mansi, vii., 89). This encouraged the Council to say, “A
pragmatic can have no force against the canons.” The commissioners asked whether it was
lawful for bishops, on the ground of a pragmatic, to steal away the rights of other churches?
The answer was explicit: “No, it is against the canon.” The Council proceeded to cancel
the resolution of the Home Synod in favour of the elevation of Berytus, ordered the 4th
Nicene canon to be read, and upheld the metropolitical rights of Tyre. The commissioners
also pronounced against Eustathius. Cecropius, bishop of Sebastopolis, requested them to
put an end to the issue of pragmatics made to the detriment of the canons; the Council
echoed this request; and the commissioners granted it by declaring that the canons should
everywhere stand good (Mansi, vii., 89–97). We may connect with this incident a law of
Marcian dated in 454, by which “all pragmatic sanctions, obtained by means of favour or
ambition in opposition to the canon of the Church, are declared to be deprived of effect”
(Cod. Justin, i., 2, 12).</p>
<p>To this decision the present canon looks back, when it forbids any bishop, on pain of
deposition, to presume to do as Eustathius had done, since it decrees that “he who attempts
to do so shall fall from his own rank (βαθμοῦ) in the Church. And cities which have already
obtained the honorary title of a metropolis from the emperor are to enjoy the honour only,
and their bishops to be but honorary metropolitans, so that all the rights of the real metropolis
are to be reserved to it.” So, at the end of the 6th session the emperor had announced
that Chalcedon was to be a titular metropolis, saving all the rights of Nicomedia; and the

<pb n="547"/>
Council had expressed its assent (Mansi, xii., 177; cf. Le Quien, i., 602). Another case was
discussed in the 13th session of the Council. Anastasius of Nicæa had claimed to be independent
of his metropolitan Eunomius of Nicomedia, on the ground of an ordinance of
Valens, recognising the city of Nicæa as by old custom a “metropolis.” Eunomius, who
complained of Anastasius’s encroachments, appealed to a later ordinance, guaranteeing to
the capital of Bithynia its rights as unaffected by the honour conferred on Nicæa: the
Council expressed its mind in favour of Eunomius, and the dispute was settled by a decision
“that the bishop of Nicomedia should have metropolitical authority over the Bithynian
churches, while the bishop of Nicæa should have merely the honour of a metropolitan, being
subjected, like the other comprovincials, to the bishop of Nicomedia (Mansi, vii., 313).
Zonaras says that this canon was in his time no longer observed; and Balsamon says that
when the primates of Heraclea and Ancyra cited it as upholding their claim to perform the
consecration of two “honorary metropolitans,” they were overruled by a decree of Alexius
Comnenus, “in presence and with consent” of a synod (on Trullan, canon xxxviij.).</p>

<p>Since in certain provinces it is permitted to the readers and singers to marry, the holy
Synod has decreed that it shall not be lawful for any of them to take a wife that is heterodox.
But those who have already begotten children of such a marriage, if they have already had
their children baptized among the heretics, must bring them into the communion of the
Catholic Church; but if they have not had them baptized, they may not hereafter baptize
them among heretics, nor give them in marriage to a heretic, or a Jew, or a heathen, unless
the person marrying the orthodox child shall promise to come over to the orthodox faith.
And if any one shall transgress this decree of the holy synod, let him be subjected to canonical
censure.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</p>
<p>A Cantor or Lector alien to the sound faith, if being then married, he shall have begotten
children let him bring them to communion, if they had there been baptized. But if they had
not yet been baptized they shall not be baptized afterwards by the heretics.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>The tenth and thirty-first canons of the Synod of Laodicea and the second of the Sixth
Synod in Trullo, and this present canon forbid one of the orthodox to be joined in marriage
with a woman who is a heretic, or vice versa. But if any of the Cantors or Lectors had taken
a wife of another sect before these canons were set forth, and had had children by her, and
had had them baptized while yet he remained among the heretics, these he should bring to
the communion of the Catholic Church. But if they had not yet been baptized, he must not
turn back and have them baptized among heretics. But departing thence let him lead them
to the Catholic Church and enrich them with divine baptism.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>According to the Latin translation of Dionysius Exiguus, who speaks only of the
daughters of the lectors, etc., the meaning may be understood, with Christian Lupus, as being
that only their daughters must not be married to heretics or Jews or heathen, but that the
sons of readers may take wives who are heretics, etc., because that men are less easily led to
fall away from the faith than women. But the Greek text makes here no distinction between
sons and daughters.</p>

<p>It is to Victor that we owe the most striking of all anecdotes about readers. During the
former persecution under Genseric (or Gaiseric), the Arians attacked a Catholic congregation
on Easter Sunday; and while a reader was standing alone in the pulpit, and chanting the
“Alleluia melody” (cf. Hammond, Liturgies, p. 95), an arrow pierced his throat, the “codex”
dropped from his hands, and he fell down dead (De Persec. Vand., i., 13). Five years before
the Council, a boy of eight named Epiphanius was made a reader in the church of Pavia,
and in process of time became famous as its bishop. Justinian forbade readers to be appointed
under eighteen (Novel., 134, 13). The office is described in the Greek Euchologion as “the
first step to the priesthood,” and is conferred with delivery of the book containing the
Epistles. Isidore of Seville, in the seventh century, tells us that the bishop ordained a reader
by delivering to him “coram plebe,” the “codex” of Scripture: and after giving precise directions
as to pronunciation and accentuation, says that the readers were of old called “heralds”
(De Eccl. Offic., ii., 11). (b) The Singers are placed by the xliijrd. Apostolic canon between
subdeacons and readers, but they rank below readers in Laodic., c. 23, in the Liturgy of St.
Mark (Hammond, p. 173), and in the canons wrongly ascribed to a IVth Council of Carthage,
which permit a presbyter to appoint a “psalmist” without the bishop’s knowledge, and rank
him even below the doorkeepers (Mansi, iii., 952). The chief passage respecting the ancient
“singers” is Laodic., xv.</p>

<p>Since this canon says nothing at all of separation in connexion with a marriage made
contrary to a vow, but only orders separation from communion, it seems very likely that
vows of this kind at the time of the synod were not considered diriment but only impedient
impediments from which the bishop of the diocese could dispense at least as far as the canonical
punishment was concerned.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The last part of the canon gives the bishop authority in certain circumstances not to
inflict the excommunication which is threatened in the first part, or again to remove it.
Thus all the old Latin translators understood our text; but Dionysius Exiguus and the Prisca
added confitentibus, meaning, “if such a virgin or monk confess and repent their fault, then
the bishop may be kind to them.” That the marriage of a monk is invalid, as was ruled by
later ecclesiastical law, our canon does not say; on the contrary, it assumes its validity, as
also the marriages contracted by priests until the beginning of the twelfth century were regarded
as valid.</p>

<p>The adjective ἐγχωρίους is probably synonymous with ἀγροικικάς (“rusticas,” Prisca),
although Dionysius and Isidorian take in as “situated on estates,” cf. Routh, Scr. Opusc., ii.,
109. It was conceivable that some such outlying districts might form, ecclesiastically, a
border-land, it might not be easy to assign them definitively to this or that bishopric. In
such a case, says the Council, if the bishop who is now in possession of these rural churches
can show a prescription of thirty years in favour of his see, let them remain undisturbed in
his obedience. (Here ἀβιάστως may be illustrated from βιασάμενος in Eph. viij. and for the
use of οἰκονομεῖν see I. Const., ij.) But the border-land might be the “debate-able” land:
the two neighbour bishops might dispute as to the right to tend these “sheep in the wilder-
ness;” as we read in Cod. Afric., 117, “multæ controversiæ postea inter episcopos de
dioecesibus ortæ sunt, et oriuntur” (see on I. Const., ij.); as archbishop Thomas of York, and
Remigius of Dorchester, were at issue for years “with reference to Lindsey” (Raine, Fasti
Eborac., i. 150). Accordingly, the canon provides that if such a contest had arisen within
the thirty years, or should thereafter arise, the prelate who considered himself wronged
might appeal to the provincial synod. If he should be aggrieved at the decision of his metropolitan
in synod, he might apply for redress to the eparch (or prefect, a substitute for exarch)
of the “diocese,” or to the see of Constantinople (in the manner provided by canon

<p>In order to appreciate this canon, we must consider the case of Ibas bishop of Edessa.
He had been attached to the Nestorians, but after the reunion between Cyril and John of
Antioch had re-entered into communion with Cyril on the ground that Cyril had explained
his anathemas (Mansi, vii., 240), or, as he wrote to Maris (in a letter famous as one of the
“Three Chapters”) that God had “softened the Egyptian’s heart” (ib., 248). Four of his priests
(Samuel, Cyrus, Maras, and Eulegius), stimulated, says Fleury (xxvij. 19) by Uranius bishop
of Himeria, accused Ibas of Nestorianism before his patriarch Domnus of Antioch, who
held a synod, but, as Samuel and Cyrus failed to appear, pronounced them defaulters and
set aside the case (Mansi, vii. 217). They went up to Constantinople, and persuaded
Theodosius and archbishop Flavian to appoint a commission for inquiring into the matter.
Two sessions, so to speak, were held by the three prelates thus appointed, one at Berytus
the other at Tyre. At Berytus, according to the extant minutes (Mansi, vii., 212 ff.), five new
accusers joined the original four, and charges were brought which affected the moral character
of Ibas as well as his orthodoxy. The charge of having used a “blasphemous” speech
implying that Christ was but a man deified, was rebutted by a statement signed by some
sixty clerics of Edessa, who according to the accusers, had been present when Ibas uttered
it. At Tyre the episcopal judges succeeded in making peace, and accusers and accused partook
of the communion together (ib., vii., 209). The sequence of these proceedings cannot be
thoroughly ascertained, but Hefele (sect. 169) agrees with Tillemont (xv., 474 et seqq.) in
dating the trial at Berytus slightly earlier than that at Tyre, and assigning both to the February
of 448 or 449. Fleury inverts this order, and thinks that, “notwithstanding the reconciliation”
at Tyre, the four accusers renewed their prosecution of Ibas (xxvij. 20); but he has to suppose
two applications on their part to Theodosius and Flavian, which seems improbable. “The

<pb n="556"/>
Council is believed,” says Tillemont (xv., 698), “to have had this case in mind when drawing
up the present canon:” and one can hardly help thinking that, on a spot within sight of
Constantinople, they must have recalled the protracted sufferings which malignant plotters
had inflicted on St. Chrysostom.</p>

it is decreed that both the received and the receiver shall be excommunicated until such
time as the clergyman who has removed shall have returned to his own church.</p>

<p>A clergyman of one city shall not be given a cure in another. But if he has been driven
from his native place and shall go into another he shall be without blame. If any bishop receives
clergymen from without his diocese he shall be excommunicated as well as the cleric he receives.</p>
<p>It is quite doubtful as to what “excommunication” means in this canon, probably not
anathematism (so think the commentators) but separation from the communion of the
other bishops, and suspension from the performance of clerical functions.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>This canon is the third of those which were originally proposed by Marcian in the end
of the sixth session, as certain articles for which synodical sanction was desirable (see above
Canons iij. and iv.). It was after they had been delivered by the Emperor’s own hand to
Anatolius of Constantinople that the Council broke out into plaudits, one of which is sufficiently
startling, τῷ ἱερεῖ, τῷ βασιλεῖ (Mansi, vii., 177). The imperial draft is in this case
very slightly altered. A reference is made to a previous determination (i.e., canon x.) against
clerical pluralities, and it is ordered that “clerics registered as belonging to one church shall
not be ranked as belonging to the church of another city, but must be content with the one
in which they were originally admitted to minister, excepting those who, having lost their
own country, have been compelled to migrate to another church,”—an exception intelligible
enough at such a period. Eleven years before, the Vandal Gaiseric had expelled the Catholic
bishops and priests of Western Africa from their churches: Quodvultdeus, bishop of Carthage
with many of his clergy, had been “placed on board some unseaworthy vessels,” and yet,
“by the Divine mercy, had been carried safe to Naples” (Vict. Vitens., De Persec. Vandal.,
i., 5: he mentions other bishops as driven into exile). Somewhat later, the surge of the
Hunnish invasion had frightened the bishop of Sirmium into sending his church vessels to
Attila’s Gaulish secretary and had swept onward in 447 to within a short distance of the

<pb n="559"/>
“New Rome” (Hodgkin, Italy and her Invaders, ii., 54–56). And the very year of the Council
was the most momentous in the whole history of the “Barbaric” movement. The bishops
who assembled in October at Chalcedon must have heard by that time of the massacre of
the Metz clergy on Easter Eve, of a bishop of Rheims slain at his own altar, of the deliverance
of Orleans at the prayer of St. Anianus, of “the supreme battle” in the plain of Chalons,
which turned back Attila and rescued Christian Gaul (Hodgkin, ii., 129–152; Kitchin, Hist.

thus consecrated, and are not ashamed to claim after such consecration the same power
over it which they had before. In the West, we find this abuse attracting the attention of
Gregory the Great, who writes to a bishop that “rationalis ordo” would not allow a layman
to pervert a monastic foundation at will to his own uses (Epist. viii., 31). In ancient Scotland,

to restore me to my just Kingly rights, and to re-establish me in my throne, I will wholly give back to his Church
all those impropriations which are now held by the Crown; and what lands soever I do now or should enjoy,
which have been taken away either from any episcopal see or any cathedral or collegiate church, from any abbey
or other religious house, I likewise promise for hereafter to hold them from the Church under such reasonable
fines and rents as shall be set down by some conscientious persons, whom I propose to choose with all uprightness
of heart to direct me in this particular. And I humbly beseech God to accept of this my vow, and to bless me in
the design I have now in hand through Jesus Christ our Lord.” “Charles R. “Oxford, April 13, 1646.”</note>

the occasional dispersion of religious communities, and, still more, the clan-principle which
assigned chieftain-rights over monasteries to the descendants of the founder, left at Dunkeld,
Brechin, Abernethy, and elsewhere, “nothing but the mere name of abbacy applied to the
lands, and of abbot borne by the secular lord for the time” (Skene’s Celtic Scotland, ii., 365;
cf. Anderson’s Scotland in Early Christian Times, p. 235). So, after the great Irish monastery
of Bangor in Down was destroyed by the Northmen, “non defuit,” says St. Bernard, “qui illud
teneret cure possessionibus suis; nam et constituebantur per electionem etiam, et abbates
appellabantur, servantes nomine, etsi non re, quod olim exstiterat” (De Vita S. Malachiæ,
vj.). So in 1188 Giraldus Cambrensis found a lay abbot in possession of the venerable church
of Llanbadarn Vawr; a “bad custom,” he says, “had grown up, whereby powerful laymen,
at first chosen by the clergy to be “oeconomi” or “patroni et defensores,” had usurped “totum
jus,” appropriated the lands, and left to the clergy nothing but the altars, with tithes and
offerings (Itin. Camb. ii., 4). This abuse must be distinguished from the corrupt device
whereby, in Bede’s later years, Northumbrian nobles contrived to gain for their estates the
immunities of abbey-lands by professing to found monasteries, which they filled with disorderly
monks, who lived there in contempt of all rule (Bede, Ep. to Egbert, vij.). In the year
of his birth, the first English synod had forbidden bishops to despoil consecrated monasteries
(Bede, iv., 5).</p>

<p>Forasmuch as certain of the metropolitans, as we have heard, neglect the flocks committed

of bishops shall take place within three months, unless an inevitable necessity should

<p>The “Steward of the Church” was to “take care of the revenues of the church widowed”
by the death of its bishop, who was regarded as representing Him to whom the whole Church
was espoused (see Eph. v. 23 ff.). So in the “order of the holy and great church” of St. Sophia,
the “Great Steward” is described as “taking the oversight of the widowed church” (Goar,
Eucholog., p. 269); so Hincmar says: “Si fuerit defunctus episcopus, ego<gap reason=" omitted"/>visitatorem ipsi
viduatæ designabo ecclesiæ; “and the phrase, “viduata per mortem N. nuper episcopi” became
common in the West (F. G. Lee, Validity of English Orders, p. 373). The episcopal ring was
a symbol of the same idea. So at St. Chrysostom’s restoration Eudoxia claimed to have
“given back the bridegroom” (Serm. post redit., iv.). So Bishop Wilson told Queen Caroline
that he “would not leave his wife in his old age because she was poor” (Keble’s Life of Wilson,
ii., 767); and Peter Mongus, having invaded the Alexandrian see while its legitimate occupant,
Timothy Salophaciolus, was alive, was expelled as an “adulterer” (Liberatus, Breviar., xviij.).</p>

<p>Forasmuch as we have heard that in certain churches the bishops managed the churchbusiness
without stewards, it has seemed good that every church having a bishop shall have
also a steward from among its own clergy, who shall manage the church business under the
sanction of his own bishop; that so the administration of the church may not be without a
witness; and that thus the goods of the church may not be squandered, nor reproach be
brought upon the priesthood; and if he [i.e., the Bishop] will not do this, he shall be subjected
to the divine canons.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVI.</p>
<p>The OEconomus in all churches must be chosen from the clergy. And the bishop who
neglects to do this is not without blame.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>As the stream of offerings became fuller, the work of dispensing them became more
complex, until the archdeacons could no longer find time for it, and it was committed to a
special officer called “oeconomus” or steward (Bingham, iii, 12, 1; Transl. of Fleury, iii.,
120). So the Council of Gangra, in the middle of the fourth century, forbids the church offerings
to be disposed of without consent of the bishop or of the person appointed, εἰς
οἰκονομίαν εὐποιϊασ (canon viij.); and St. Basil mentions the oeconomi of his own church
(Epist., xxiij. 1), and the “ταμίαι of the sacred goods” of his brother’s at Nyssa (ib., 225).
And although Gregory Nazianzen took credit to himself for declining to appoint a “stranger”
to make an estimate of the property which of right belonged to the church of Constantinople,
and in fact, with a strange confusion between personal and official obligations, gave the goby
to the whole question (Carm. de Vita sua, 1479 ff.), his successor, Nectarius, being a man
of business, took care to appoint a “church-steward”; and Chrysostom, on coming to the
see, examined his accounts, and found much superfluous expenditure (Palladius, Dial, p.
19). Theophilus of Alexandria compelled two of the Tall Brothers to undertake the οἰκονομία
of the Alexandrian church (Soc., vi. 7); and in one of his extant directions observes that the
clergy of Lyco wish for another “oeconomus,” and that the bishop has consented, in order
that the church-funds may be properly spent (Mansi, iii., 1257). At Hippo St. Augustine
had a “præpositus domus” who acted as Church-steward (Possidius, Vit. August., xxiv.).
Isidore of Pelusium denounces Martinianus as a fraudulent “oeconomus,” and requests Cyril
to appoint an upright one (Epist. ii., 127), and in another letter urges him to put a stop to
the dishonest greed of those who acted as stewards of the same church (ib., v. 79). The re-

<pb n="567"/>
cords of the Council of Ephesus mention the “oeconomus” of Constantinople, the
“oeconomus” of Ephesus (Mansi, iv., 1228–1398), and, the “oeconomus” of Philadelphia.
According to an extant letter of Cyril, the “oeconomi” of Perrha in Syria were mistrusted by
the clergy, who wished to get rid of them “and appoint others by their own authority” (ib.,
vii., 321). Ibas of Edessa had been complained of for his administration of church property;
he was accused, e.g., of secreting a jewelled chalice, and bestowing the church revenues, and
gold and silver crosses, on his brother and cousins; he ultimately undertook to appoint
“oeconomi” after the model of Antioch (Mansi, vii., 201). Proterius, afterwards patriarch
of Alexandria and a martyr for Chalcedonian orthodoxy, was “oeconomus” under Dioscorus
(ib., iv., 1017), as was John Talaia, a man accused of bribery, under his successor (Evag., iii.,
12). There may have been many cases in which there was no “oeconomus,” or in which the
management was in the hands of private agents of the bishop, in whom the Church could
put no confidence; and the Council, having alluded to the office of “oeconomus” in canons
ij. and xxv., now observes that some bishops had been managing their church property
without “oeconomi,” and thereupon resolves “that every church which has a bishop shall
also have an oeconomus” from among its own clergy, to administer the property of the
church under the direction of its own bishop; so that the administration of the church
property may not be unattested, and thereby waste ensue, and the episcopate incur reproach.”
Any bishop who should neglect to appoint such an officer should be punishable under “the
divine” (or sacred) “canons.”</p>
<p>Nearly three years after the Council, Leo saw reason for requesting Marcian not to allow
civil judges, “novo exemplo,” to audit the accounts of “the oeconomi of the church of Constantinople,”
which ought, “secundum traditum morem,” to be examined by the bishop
alone (Epist. cxxxvij. 2). In after days the “great steward” of St. Sophia was always a deacon;
he was a conspicuous figure at the Patriarch’s celebrations, standing on the right of the altar,
vested in alb and stole, and holding the sacred fan (ῥιπίδιον); his duty was to enter all incomings
and outgoings of the church’s revenue in a charterlary, and exhibit it quarterly, or
half yearly, to the patriarchs; and he governed the church during a vacancy of the see
(Eucholog., pp. 268, 275). In the West, Isidore of Seville describes the duties of the
“oeconomus”; he has to see to the repair and building of churches, the care of church lands,
the cultivation of vineyards, the payment of clerical stipends, of doles to the widows and
the poor, and of food and clothing to church servants, and even the carrying on of church
law suits,—all “cum jussu et arbitrio sui episcopi” (Ep. to Leudefred, Op. ii., 520); and before
Isidore’s death the IVth Council of Toledo refers to this canon, and orders the bishops to
appoint “from their own clergy those whom the Greeks call oeconomi, hoc est, qui vici
episcoporum res ecclesiasticas tractant (canon xlviij., Mansi, x, 631). There was an officer
named “oeconomus” in the old Irish monasteries; see Reeves’ edition of Adamnan, p. 47.</p>

<head>Canon XXVIII.</head>
<p>Following in all things the decisions of the holy Fathers, and acknowledging the canon,
which has been just read, of the One Hundred and Fifty Bishops beloved-of-God (who assembled
in the imperial city of Constantinople, which is New Rome, in the time of the Emperor
Theodosius of happy memory), we also do enact and decree the same things concerning
the privileges of the most holy Church of Constantinople, which is New Rome. For the
Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city.
And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration,
gave equal privileges (ἴσα πρεσβεῖα) to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging
that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges
with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she
is, and rank next after her; so that, in the Pontic, the Asian, and the Thracian dioceses, the
metropolitans only and such bishops also of the Dioceses aforesaid as are among the barbarians,
should be ordained by the aforesaid most holy throne of the most holy Church of
Constantinople; every metropolitan of the aforesaid dioceses, together with the bishops of
his province, ordaining his own provincial bishops, as has been declared by the divine canons;
but that, as has been above said, the metropolitans of the aforesaid Dioceses should be ordained
by the archbishop of Constantinople, after the proper elections have been held according
to custom and have been reported to him.</p>

<p>It is certain that this canon was expressly renewed by canon xxxvi. of the Council of
Trullo and from that time has been numbered by the Greeks among the canons; and at last
it was acknowledged by some Latin collectors also, and was placed by Gratian in his Decretum,
although clearly with a different sense. (Pars I., Dist. xxii., C. vj.)</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>Here is a great addition to the canon of 381, so ingeniously linked on to it as to seem at
first sight a part of it. The words καὶ ὥστε are meant to suggest that what follows is in fact

<pb n="571"/>
involved in what has preceded: whereas a new point of departure is here taken, and instead
of a mere “honorary pre-eminence” the bishop of Constantinople acquires a vast jurisdiction,
the independent authority of three exarchs being annulled in order to make him patriarch.
Previously he had προεδρία now he gains προστασία. As we have seen, a series of aggrandizements
in fact had prepared for this aggrandizement in law; and various metropolitans of
Asia Minor expressed their contentment at seeing it effected. “It is, indeed, more than
probable that the self-assertion of Rome excited the jealousy of her rival of the East,” and
thus “Eastern bishops secretly felt that the cause of Constantinople was theirs” (Gore’s Leo
the Great, p. 120); but the gratification of Constantinople ambition was not the less, in a
canonical sense, a novelty, and the attempt to enfold it in the authority of the Council of
381 was rather astute than candid. The true plea, whatever might be its value, was that the
Council had to deal with a fait accompli, which it was wise at once to legalize and to regulate;
that the “boundaries of the respective exarchates…were ecclesiastical arrangements made
with a view to the general good and peace of the Church, and liable to vary with the dispensations
to which the Church was providentially subjected,” so that “by confirming the ἐκ
πολλοῦ κρατῆσαν ἔθος in regard to the ordination of certain metropolitans (see Ep. of
Council to Leo, Leon. Epist. xcviij., 4), “they were acting in the spirit, while violating the
letter, of the ever-famous rule of Nicæa, τὰ αρχεῖα ἔθη κρατείτο (cp. Newman, Transl. of
Fleury, iii., 407). It is observable that Aristenus295 and Symeon, Logothetes reckon this
decree as a XXIXth canon (Justellus, ii., 694, 720).</p>
<p>After the renewal of this canon by the Council of Trullo, Gratian adds “The VIIIth
Synod held under Pope Hadrian II., canon xxj.” (Decretum Pars I., Dist. xxij., C. vij.) “We
define that no secular power shall hereafter dishonour anyone of these who rule our patriarchal
sees, or attempt to move them from their proper throne, but shall judge them worthy
of all reverence and honour; chiefly the most holy Pope of Old Rome, and then the Patriarch
of Constantinople, and then those of Alexandria, and Antioch, and Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>Some Greek codices have the following heading to this canon.</p>
<p>“Decree of the same holy Synod published on account of the privileges of the throne of
the most holy Church of Constantinople.”</p>
<p>Tillemont.</p>
<p>This canon seems to recognise no particular authority in the Church of Rome, save
what the Fathers had granted it, as the seat of the empire. And it attributes in plain words
as much to Constantinople as to Rome, with the exception of the first place. Nevertheless
I do not observe that the Popes took up a thing so injurious to their dignity, and of so dan-
<note type="footnote">295 Such is not the case in Aristenus as found in Beveridge, Tom. I., p. 147.</note>

<pb n="572"/>
gerous a consequence to the whole Church. For what Lupus quotes of St. Leo’s lxxviij. (civ.)
letter, refers rather to Alexandria and to Antioch, than to Rome. St. Leo is contented to
destroy the foundation on which they built the elevation of Constantinople, maintaining
that a thing so entirely ecclesiastical as the episcopate ought not to be regulated by the
temporal dignity of cities, which, nevertheless, has been almost always followed in the establishment
of the metropolis, according to the Council of Nicea.</p>
<p>St. Leo also complains that the Council of Chalcedon broke the decrees of the Council
of Nice, the practice of antiquity, and the rights of Metropolitans. Certainly it was an odious
innovation to see a Bishop made the chief, not of one department but of three; for which
no example could be found save in the authority which the Popes took over Illyricum, where,
however, they did not claim the power to ordain any Bishop.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Later History of Canon XXVIII.</head>
<p>Among the bishops who gave their answers at the last session to the question whether
their subscription to the canons was voluntary or forced was Eusebius, bishop of Dorylæum,
an Asiatic bishop who said that he had read the Constantinopolitan canon to “the holy pope
of Rome in presence of clerics of Constantinople, and that he had accepted it” (L. and C.,
Conc., iv. 815). But quite possibly this evidence is of little value. But what is more to the
point is that the Papal legates most probably had already at this very council recognized the
right of Constantinople to rank immediately after Rome. For at the very first session when
the Acts of the Latrocinium were read, it was found that to Flavian, the Archbishop of
Constantinople, was given only the fifth place. Against this the bishop protested and asked,
“Why did not Flavian receive his position?” and the papal legate Paschasinus answered:
“We will, please God, recognize the present bishop Anatolius of Constantinople as the first
<del>i.e. after us</del>, but Dioscorus made Flavian the fifth.” It would seem to be in vain to attempt
to escape the force of these words by comparing with them the statement made in the last
session, in a moment of heat and indignation, by Lucentius the papal legate, that the canons
of Constantinople were not found among those of the Roman Code. It may well be that
this statement was true, and yet it does not in any way lessen the importance of the fact that
at the first session (a very different thing from the sixteenth) Paschasinus had admitted that
Constantinople enjoyed the second place. It would seem that Quesnel has proved his point,
notwithstanding the attempts of the Ballerini to counteract and overthrow his arguments.</p>
<p>It would be the height of absurdity for any one to attempt to deny that the canon of
Constantinople was entirely in force and practical execution, as far of those most interested
were concerned, long before the meeting of the council of Chalcedon, and in 394, only
thirteen years after the adoption of the canon, we find the bishop of Constantinople
presiding at a synod at which both the bishop of Alexandria and the bishop of Antioch were
present.</p>
<p>St. Leo made, in connexion with this matter, some statements which perhaps need not
be commented upon, but should certainly not be forgotten. In his epistle to Anatolius (no.
cvi.) in speaking of the third canon of Constantinople he says: “That document of certain
bishops has never been brought by your predecessors to the knowledge of the Apostolic
See.” And in writing to the Empress (Ep. cv., ad Pulch.) he makes the following statement,
strangely contrary to what she at least knew to be the fact, “To this concession a long course
of years has given no effect!”</p>
<p>We need not stop to consider the question why Leo rejected the xxviijth canon of
Chalcedon. It is certain that he rejected it and those who wish to see the motive of this rejection
considered at length are referred to Quesnel and to the Ballerini; the former affirming

<pb n="574"/>
that it was because of its encroachments upon the prerogatives of his own see, the latter
urging that it was only out of his zeal for the keeping in full force of the Nicene decree.</p>
<p>Leo can never be charged with weakness. His rejection of the canon was absolute and
unequivocal. In writing to the Emperor he says that Anatolius only got the See of Constantinople
by his consent, that he should behave himself modestly, and that there is no way
he can make of Constantinople “an Apostolic See,” and adds that “only from love of peace
and for the restoration of the unity of the faith” he has “abstained from annulling this ordination”
(Ep. civ.).</p>
<p>To the Empress he wrote with still greater violence: “As for the resolution of the bishops
which is contrary to the Nicene decree, in union with your faithful piety, I declare it to be
invalid and annul it by the authority of the holy Apostle Peter” (Ep. cv.).</p>
<p>The papal annulling does not appear to have been of much force, for Leo himself confesses,
in a letter written about a year later to the Empress Pulcheria (Ep. cxvi.), that the Illyrian
bishops had since the council subscribed the xxviiith canon.</p>
<p>The pope had taken occasion in his letter in which he announced his acceptance of the
doctrinal decrees of Chalcedon to go on further and express his rejection of the canons.
This part of the letter was left unread throughout the Greek empire, and Leo complains of
it to Julian of Cos (Ep. cxxvij.).</p>
<p>Leo never gave over his opposition, although the breach was made up between him and
Anatolius by an apparently insincere letter on the part of the latter (Ep. cxxxii.). Leo’s successors
followed his example in rejecting the canons, both the IIId of Constantinople and
the XXVIIIth of Chalcedon, but as M. l’abbé Duchesne so admirably says: “Mais leur voix
fut peu écoutée; on leur accorda sans doute des satisfactions, mais de pure cérémonie.”296
But Justinian acknowledged the Constantinopolitan and Chalcedonian rank of Constantinople
in his CXXXIst Novel. (cap. j.), and the Synod in Trullo in canon xxxvj. renewed
exactly canon xxviij. of Chalcedon. Moreover the Seventh Ecumenical with the approval
of the Papal Legates gave a general sanction to all the canons accepted by the Trullan Synod.
And finally in 1215 the Fourth Council of the Lateran in its Vth Canon acknowledged
Constantinople’s rank as immediately after Rome, but this was while Constantinople was
in the hands of the Latins! Subsequently at Florence the second rank, in accordance with
the canons of I. Constantinople and of Chalcedon (which had been annulled by Leo) was
given to the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople, and so the opposition of Rome gave way
after seven centuries and a half, and the Nicene Canon which Leo declared to be “inspired
by the Holy Ghost” and “valid to the end of time” (Ep. cvi.), was set at nought by Leo’s successor
in the Apostolic See.</p>

almost all ecclesiastical canons in general; on the contrary, there adheres to it a portion of
the debate, of which it is a fragment, in which Anatolius is introduced as speaking. Besides
it is wanting in all the old Greek, as well as in the Latin collections of canons, and in those
of John of Antioch and of Photius, and has only been appended to the twenty-eight genuine
canons of Chalcedon from the fact that a later transcriber thought fit to add to the genuine

canons the general and important principle contained in the place in question of the fourth

<p>Since the most religious bishops of Egypt have postponed for the present their subscription
to the letter of the most holy Archbishop Leo, not because they oppose the Catholic
Faith, but because they declare that it is the custom in the Egyptian diocese to do no such
thing without the consent and order of their Archbishop, and ask to be excused until the
ordination of the new bishop of the metropolis of Alexandria, it has seemed to us reasonable
and kind that this concession should be made to them, they remaining in their official habit
in the imperial city until the Archbishop of the Metropolis of Alexandria shall have been
ordained.</p>
<p>And the most religious Bishop Paschasinus, representative of the Apostolic throne for
<del>Rome298</del>, said:</p>
<p>If your authority suggests and commands that any indulgence be shewn to them, let
them give securities that they will not depart from this city until the city of Alexandria receives
a Bishop.</p>
<p>And the most magnificent and glorious judges, and the whole Senate, said:</p>
<p>Let the sentence of the most holy Paschasinus be confirmed.</p>
<p>And therefore let them <del>i.e., the most religious Bishops of the Egyptians</del> remain in their
official habit, either giving securities, if they can, or being bound by the obligation of an
oath.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXX.</p>
<p>It is the custom of the Egyptians that none subscribe299 without the permission of their
Archbishop. Wherefore they are not to be blamed who did not subscribe the Epistle of the holy Leo until an Archbishop had been appointed for them.</p>
<p>As in the case of the last so-called “canon” I have followed a usual Greek method, the
wording departs but little from that of the acts (Vide L. and C., Conc., Tom. IV., col. 517).</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>This paragraph, like the previous one, is not a proper canon, but a verbal repetition of
a proposal made in the fourth session by the imperial commissioners, improved by the legate
Paschasinus, and approved by the Synod. Moreover, this so-called canon is not found in
<note type="footnote">298 These words do not occur in the Acts.</note>
<note type="footnote">299 i.e., a conciliar decree.</note>

<pb n="579"/>
the ancient collections, and was probably added to the twenty-eight canons in the same
manner and for the same reasons as the preceding.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>
<p>The council could insist with all plainness on the duty of hearing before condemning
(see on Canon XXIX.); yet on this occasion bishop after bishop gave vent to harsh unfeeling
absolutism, the only excuse for which consists in the fact that the outrages of the Latrocinium
were fresh in their minds, and that three of the Egyptian supplicants, whom they were so
eager to terrify or crush, had actually supported Dioscorus on the tragical August 8, 449.
It was not in human nature to forget this; but the result is a blot on the history of the
Council of Chalcedon.</p>

<head>Session XVI.</head>
<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. IV., col. 794.)</p>
<p>Paschasinus and Lucentius, the most reverend bishops, holding the place of the
Apostolic See, said: If your magnificence so orders, we have something to lay before you.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges, said: Say what you wish. The most holy Paschasinus the
bishop, holding the place of Rome, said: The rulers of the world, taking care of the holy
Catholic faith, by which their kingdom and glory is increased, have deigned to define this,
in order that unity through a holy peace may be preserved through all the churches. But
with still greater care their clemency has vouchsafed to provide for the future, so that no
contention may spring up again between God’s bishops, nor any schisms, nor any scandal.
But yesterday after your excellencies and our humility had left, it is said that certain decrees
were made, which we esteem to have been done contrary to the canons, and contrary to
ecclesiastical discipline. We request that your magnificence order these things to be read,
that all the brethren may know whether the things done are just or unjust.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: If anything was done after our leaving let it be read.</p>
<p>And before the reading, Aëtius, the Archdeacon of the Church of Constantinople said:
It is certain that the matters touching the faith received a suitable form. But it is customary
at synods, after those things which are chiefest of all shall have been defined, that other
things also which are necessary should be examined and put into shape. We have, I mean
the most holy Church of Constantinople has, manifestly things to be attended to. We asked
the lord bishops (κυρίοις τοις ἐπισκοποις) from Rome, to join with us in these matters, but
they declined, saying they had received no instructions on the subject. We referred the
matter to your magnificence and you bid the holy Synod to consider this very point. And
when your magnificence had gone forth, as the affair was one of common interest, the most
holy bishops, standing up, prayed that this thing might be done. And they were present
here, and this was done in no hidden nor secret fashion, but in due course and in accordance
with the canons.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: Let the acts be read.</p>
<p><del> The canon (number XXVIII.), was then read, and the signatures, in all 192, including
the bishops of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Heraclea, but not Thalassius of Cæsarea who afterwards
assented. Only a week before 350had signed the Definition of faith. When the last name was
read a debate arose as follows. (Col. 810.).</del></p>
<p>Lucentius, the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See, said: In the first
place let your excellency notice that it was brought to pass by circumventing the holy bishops

<pb n="581"/>
so that they were forced to sign the as yet unwritten canons, of which they made mention.
<del>The Greek reads a little differently (I have followed the Latin as it is supposed by the critics
to be more pure than the Greek we now have): Your excellency has perceived how many
things were done in the presence of the bishops, in order that no one might be forced to
sign the aforementioned canons; defining by necessity.</del></p>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried out: No one was forced.</p>
<p>Lucentius the most reverend bishop and legate of the Apostolic See, said: It is manifest
that the decrees of the 318 have been put aside, and that mention only has been made of
those of the 150, which are not found to have any place in the synodical canons, and which
were made as they acknowledge eighty years ago. If therefore they enjoyed this privilege
during these years, what do they seek for now? If they never used it, why seek it? <del>The Greek
reads: “It is manifest that the present decrees have been added to the decrees of the 318 and
to those of the 150 after them, decrees not received into the synodical canons, these things
they pretend to be defined. If therefore in these times they used this benefit what now do
they seek which according to the canons they had not used?</del></p>
<p>Aëtius, the archdeacon of the most holy Church of Constantinople, said: If on this
subject they had received any commands, let them be brought forward.</p>
<p>Bonifacius, a presbyter and vicar of the Apostolic See, said: The most blessed and
Apostolic Pope, among other things, gave us this commandment. And he read from the
chart, “The rulings of the holy fathers shall with no rashness be violated or diminished. Let
the dignity of our person in all ways be guarded by you. And if any, influenced by the power
of his own city, should undertake to make usurpations, withstand this with suitable firmness.”
The most glorious judges said: Let each party quote the canons.</p>
<p>Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and representative, read: Canon Six of the 318
holy fathers, “The Roman Church hath always had the primacy. Let Egypt therefore so hold
itself that the bishop of Alexandria have the authority over all, for this is also the custom as
regards the bishop of Rome. So too at Antioch and in the other provinces let the churches
of the larger cities have the primacy. <del>In the Greek ‘let the primacy be kept to the churches;’
a sentence which I do not understand, unless it means that for the advantage of the churches
the primatial rights of Antioch must be upheld. But such a sentiment one would expect to
find rather in the Latin than in the Greek.</del> And one thing is abundantly clear, that if any
one shall have been ordained bishop contrary to the will of the metropolitan, this great
synod has decreed that such an one ought not to be bishop. If however the judgment of all
his own <del>fellows</del> is reasonable and according to the canons, and if two or three dissent
through their own obstinacy, then let the vote of the majority prevail. For a custom has

<pb n="582"/>
prevailed, and it is an ancient tradition, that the bishop of Jerusalem be honoured, let him
have his consequent honour, but the rights of his own metropolis must be preserved.”
Constantine, the secretary, read from a book handed him by Aëtius, the archdeacon;</p>
<p>Canon Six of the 318 holy Fathers. “Let the ancient customs prevail, those of Egypt, so that
the bishop of Alexandria shall have jurisdiction over all, since this also is the custom at
Rome. Likewise at Antioch and in the rest of the provinces, let the rank (πρεσβεῖα) be preserved
to the churches. For this is absolutely clear that if anyone contrary to the will of the
metropolitan be ordained bishop, such an one the great synod decreed should not be a
bishop. If however by the common vote of all, founded upon reason, and according to the
canons, two or three moved by their own obstinacy, make opposition, let the vote of the
majority stand.”</p>
<p>The same secretary read from the same codex the determination of the Second Synod.
“These things the bishops decreed who assembled by the grace of God in Constantinople
from far separated provinces,<gap reason="omitted"/>and bishops are not to go to churches which are outside the
bounds of their dioceses, nor to confound the churches, but according to the canons the
bishop of Alexandria shall take the charge of the affairs of Egypt only, and the bishops of
Orient shall govern the Oriental diocese only, the honours due to the Church of Antioch
being guarded according to the Nicene canons, and the Asiatic bishops shall care for the
diocese of Asia only, and those of Pontus the affairs of Pontus only, and those of Thrace the
affairs of Thrace only. But bishops shall not enter uncalled another diocese for ordination,
or any other ecclesiastical function. And the aforesaid canon concerning dioceses being
observed, it is evident that the synod of every province will administer the affairs of that
particular province as was decreed at Nice. But the churches of God in heathen nations
must be governed according to the custom which has prevailed from the times of the Fathers.
The bishop of Constantinople however shall have the prerogative of honour next after the
bishop of Rome, because Constantinople is new Rome.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>An attempt has been made to shew that this statement of the acts is a mere blunder.
That no correct copy of the Nicene canons was read, and that the council accepted the version
produced by the Roman legate as genuine. The proposition appears to me in itself ridiculous,
and taken in connexion with the fact that the acts shew that the true canon of Nice was read
immediately afterwards I cannot think the hypothesis really worthy of serious consideration.
But it is most ably defended by the Ballerini in their edition of St. Leo’s works (Tom. iii., p.
xxxvij. et seqq.) and Hefele seems to have accepted their conclusions (Vol. III., p. 435).
Bright, however, I think, takes a most just view of the case, whom I therefore quote.</p>
<p>Bright.</p>

<pb n="583"/>
<p>If we place ourselves for a moment in the position of the ecclesiastics of Constantinople
when they heard Paschasinus read his “version,” which the Ballerini gently describe as
“differing a little” from the Greek text, we shall see that it was simply impossible for them
not to quote that text as it was preserved in their archives, and had been correctly translated
by Philo and Evarestus in their version beginning “Antiqui mores obtineant.” No comment
on the difference between it and the Roman “version” is recorded to have been made: and,
in truth, none was necessary. Simply to confront the two, and pass on to the next point,
was to confute Paschasinus at once most respectfully and most expressively.</p>
<p>It should be added that the Ballerini ground their theory chiefly upon the authority of
a Latin ms., the Codex Julianus, now called Parisiensis, in which this reading of the true text
of the canon of Nice is not contained, as Baluzius was the first to point out.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: Let the most holy Asiatic and Pontic bishops who have
signed the tome just read say whether they gave their signatures of their own judgment or
compelled by any necessity. And when these were come into the midst, the most reverend
Diogenes, the bishop of Cyzicum, said: I call God to witness that I signed of my own judgment.
<del>And so on, one after the other.</del></p>
<p>The rest cried out: We signed willingly.</p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: As it is manifest that the subscription of each one of the
bishops was given without any necessity but of his own will, let the most holy bishops who
have not signed say something.</p>
<p>Eusebius, the bishop of Ancyra, said: I am about to speak but for myself alone.</p>
<p><del>His speech is a personal explanation of his own action with regard to consecrating a
bishop for Gangra.</del></p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: From what has been done and brought forward on each
side, we perceive that the primacy of all (πρὸ πάντων τὰ πρωτεῖα) and the chief honour
(τὴν ἐξαίρετον τιμὴν) according to the canons, is to be kept for the most God-beloved
archbishop of Old Rome, but that the most reverend archbishop of the royal city Constantinople,
which is new Rome, is to enjoy the honour of the same primacy, and to have
the power to ordain the metropolitans in the Asiatic, Pontic, and Thracian dioceses, in this
manner: that there be elected by the clergy, and substantial (κτητόρων) and most distinguished
men of each metropolis and moreover by all the most reverend bishops of the
province, or a majority of them, and that he be elected whom those afore mentioned shall
deem worthy of the metropolitan episcopate and that he should be presented by all those
who had elected him to the most holy archbishop of royal Constantinople, that he might

<pb n="584"/>
be asked whether he <del>i.e., the Patriarch of Constantinople</del> willed that he should there be
ordained, or by his commission in the province where he received the vote to the episcopate.
The most reverend bishops of the ordinary towns should be ordained by all the most reverend
bishops of the province or by a majority of them, the metropolitan having his power according
to the established canon of the fathers, and making with regard to such ordinations no
communications to the most holy archbishop of royal Constantinople. Thus the matter
appears to us to stand. Let the holy Synod vouchsafe to teach its view of the case.</p>
<p>The most reverend bishops cried out: This is a just sentence. So we all say. These things
please us all. This is a just determination. Establish the proposed form of decree. This is
a just vote. All has been decreed as should be. We beg you to let us go. By the safety of the
Emperor let us go. We all will remain in this opinion, we all say the same things.</p>
<p>Lucentius, the bishop, said: The Apostolic See gave orders that all things should be
done in our presence <del>This sentence reads in the Latin: The Apostolic See ought not to be
humiliated in our presence. I do not know why Canon Bright in his notes on Canon XXVIII.
has followed this reading</del>; and therefore whatever yesterday was done to the prejudice of
the canons during our absence, we beseech your highness to command to be rescinded.
But if not, let our opposition be placed in the minutes, and pray let us know clearly <del>Lat.
that we may know</del> what we are to report to that most apostolic bishop who is the ruler of
the whole church, so that he may be able to take action with regard to the indignity done to his See and to the setting at naught of the canons.</p>
<p><del>John, the most reverend bishop of Sebaste, said: We all will remain of the opinion expressed
by your magnificence.300</del></p>
<p>The most glorious judges said: The whole synod has approved what we proposed.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>(Hist. Counc., Vol. III., p. 428.)</p>
<p>That is, the prerogative assigned to the Church of Constantinople is, in spite of the opposition
of the Roman legate decreed by the Synod. Thus ended the Council of Chalcedon
after it had lasted three weeks.</p>
<p>How it is possible after reading the foregoing proceedings to imagine for an instant that
the bishops of this Council considered the rights they were discussing to be of Divine origin,
and that the occupant of the See of Rome was, jure divino, supreme over all pontiffs I cannot
understand. It is quite possible, of course, to affirm, as some have done, that the acts, as we
<note type="footnote">300 These words are found only in the Latin.</note>

<pb n="585"/>
have them, have been mutilated, but the contention involves not only many difficulties but
also no few absurdities; and yet I cannot but think that even this extreme hypothesis is to
be preferred to any attempt to reconcile the acts as we now have them with the acceptance
on the part of the members of the council of the doctrine of a jure divino Papal Supremacy
as it is now held by the Latin Church.</p>

<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>(Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. IV., p. 289.)</p>
<p>In accordance with the imperial command, but without the assent of the Pope, the
synod was opened on the 5th of May a.d. 553, in the Secretarium of the Cathedral Church
at Constantinople. Among those present were the Patriarchs, Eutychius of Constantinople,
who presided, Apollinaris of Alexandria, Domninus of Antioch, three bishops as representatives
of the Patriarch Eustochius of Jerusalem, and 145 other metropolitans and bishops, of whom many came also in the place of absent colleagues.</p>
<p>(Bossuet, Def. Cleri Gall., Lib. vii., cap. xix. Abridged. Translation by Allies.)</p>
<p>The three chapters were the point in question; that is, respecting Theodore of
Mopsuestia, Theodoret’s writings against Cyril, and the letter of Ibas of Edessa to Maris the
Persian. They examined whether that letter had been approved in the Council of Chalcedon.
So much was admitted that it had been read there, and that Ibas, after anathematizing
Nestorius, had been received by the holy Council. Some contended that his person only
was spared; others that his letter also was approved. Thus inquiry was made at the fifth
Council how the writings on the Faith were wont to be approved in former Councils. The
Acts of the third and fourth Council, those which we have mentioned above respecting the
letter of St. Cyril and of St. Leo, were set forth. Then the holy Council declared: “It is plain,
from what has been recited, in what manner the holy Councils are wont to approve what is
brought before them. For great as was the dignity of those holy men who wrote the letters
recited, yet they did not approve their letters simply or without inquiry, nor without taking
cognizance that they were in all things agreeable to the exposition and doctrine of the holy
Fathers, with which they were compared.” But the Acts proved that this course was not
pursued in the case of the letter of Ibas; they inferred, therefore, most justly, that that letter
had not been approved. So, then, it is certain from the third and fourth Councils, the fifth
so declaring and understanding it, that letters approved by the Apostolic See, such as was
that of Cyril, or even proceeding from it, as that of Leo, were received by the holy Councils
not simply, nor without inquiry. The holy Fathers proceed to do what the Bishops at
Chalcedon would have done, had they undertaken the examination of Ibas’s letter. They
compare the letter with the Acts of Ephesus and Chalcedon. Which done, the holy Council
declared—“The comparison made proves, beyond a doubt, that the letter which Ibas is said
to have written is, in all respects, opposed to the definition of the right Faith, which the
Council of Chalcedon set forth.” All the Bishops cried out, “We all say this; the letter is
heretical.” Thus, therefore, is it proved by the fifth Council, that our holy Fathers in Ecumenical
Councils pronounce the letters read, whether of Catholics or heretics, or even of
Roman Pontiffs, and that on matter of Faith, to be orthodox or heretical, according to the

<pb n="588"/>
same procedure, after legitimate cognizance, the truth being inquired into, and then cleared
up; and upon these premises judgment given.</p>
<p>What! you will say, with no distinction, and with minds equally inclined to both parties?
Indeed, we have said, and shall often repeat, that there was a presumption in favour of the
decrees of orthodox Pontiffs; but in Ecumenical Councils, where judgment is to be passed
in matter of Faith, that they were bound no longer to act upon presumption, but on the
truth clearly and thoroughly ascertained.</p>
<p>Such were the Acts of the fifth Council. This it learnt from the third and fourth Councils,
and approved; and in this argument we have brought at once in favour of our opinion the
decrees of three Ecumenical Councils, of Ephesus, of Chalcedon, and the second Con
stantinopolitan. The Emperor Justinian desired that the question concerning the abovementioned
Three Chapters should be considered in the Church. He therefore sent for Pope
Vigilius to Constantinople. There he not long after assembled a council. He and the Orientals
thought it of great moment that these Chapters should be condemned, against the
Nestorians, who were raising their heads to defend them; Vigilius, with the Occidentals,
feared lest this occasion should be taken to destroy the authority of the Council of Chalcedon:
because it was admitted that Theodoret and Ibas had been received in that Council, whilst
Theodore, though named, was let go without any mark of censure. Though then both parties
easily agreed as to the substance of the Faith, yet the question had entirely respect to the
Faith, it being feared by the one party lest the Nestorian, by the other lest the Eutychian,
enemies of the Council of Chalcedon should prevail. Vigilius on the 11th of April, 548, issues
his “Judicatum” against the Three Chapters, saving the authority of the Council of
Chalcedon. Thereupon the Bishops of Africa, Illyria, and Dalmatia, with two of his own
confidential Deacons, withdraw from his communion. In the year 550 the African Bishops,
under Reparatus of Carthage, not only reject the Judicatum, but anathematize Vigilius
himself, and sever him from Catholic Communion, reserving to him a place for repentance.
At length the Pope publicly withdraws his “Judicatum.” While the Council is sitting at
Constantinople he publishes his “Constitutum,” in which he condemns certain propositions
of Theodore, but spares his person; the same respecting Theodoret; but with respect to Ibas,
he declares that his letter was pronounced orthodox by the Council of Chalcedon. However
this may be, so much is clear, that Vigilius, though invited, declined being present at the
council: that nevertheless the council was held without him; that he published a “Constitutum,”
in which he disapproved of what Theodore, Theodoret, and Ibas were said to have
written against the Faith; but decreed that their names should be spared because they were
considered to have been received by the fourth Council, or to have died in the communion
of the Church, and to be reserved to the judgment of God. Concerning the letter of Ibas,
he published the following, that, “understood in the best and most pious sense,” it was

<pb n="589"/>
blameless; and concerning the three Chapters generally, he ordered that after his present
declaration ecclesiastics should move no further question.</p>
<p>Such was the decree of Vigilius, issued upon the authority with which he was invested.
But the council, after his Constitution, both raised a question about the Three Chapters,
and decided that question was properly raised concerning the dead, and that the letter of
Ibas was manifestly heretical and Nestorian, and contrary in all things to the Faith of
Chalcedon, and that they were altogether accursed, who defended the impious Theodore
of Mopsuestia, or the writings of Theodoret against Cyril, or the impious letter of Ibas defending
the tenets of Nestorius: and all such as did not anathematize it, but said it was
correct.</p>
<p>In these latter words they seemed not even to spare Vigilius, although they did not
mention his name. And it is certain their decree was confirmed by Pelagius the Second,
Gregory the Great, and other Roman Pontiffs. These things prove, that in a matter of the
utmost importance, disturbing the whole Church, and seeming to belong to the Faith, the
decrees of sacred councils prevail over the decrees of Pontiffs, and that the letter of Ibas,
though defended by a judgment of the Roman Pontiff, could nevertheless be proscribed as
heretical.</p>

<pb n="590"/>
<head>Excursus on the Genuineness of the Acts of the Fifth Council.</head>
<p>Some suspicion has arisen with regard to how far the acts of the Fifth Ecumenical
Council may be relied upon. Between the Roman Manuscript printed by Labbe and the
Paris manuscript found in Mansi there are considerable variations and, strange to say, some
of the most injurious things to the memory of Pope Vigilius are found only in the Paris
manuscript. Moreover we know that the manuscript kept in the patriarchal archives at
Constantinople had been tampered with during the century that elapsed before the next
Ecumenical Synod, for at that council the forgeries and interpolations were exposed by the
Papal Legates.</p>
<p>At the XIVth Session of that synod the examination of the genuineness of the acts of
the Second Council of Constantinople was resumed. It had been begun at the XIIth Session.
Up to this time only two mss. had been used, now the librarian of the patriarchate presented
a third ms. which he had found in the archives, and swore that neither himself nor any
other so far as he knew had made any change in these mss. These were then compared and
it was found that the two first agreed in containing the pretended letter of Mennas to Pope
Vigilius, and the two writings addressed by Vigilius to Justinian and Theodora; but that
none of these were found in the third ms. It was further found that the documents in dispute
were in a different hand from the rest of the ms., and that in the first book of the parchment
ms., three quarternions had been inserted, and in the second book between quarternions
15 and 16, four unpaged leaves had been placed. So too the second ms. had been tampered
with. The council inserted these particulars in a decree, and ordered that “these additions
must be quashed in both mss., and marked with an obelus, and the falsifiers must be smitten
with anathema.” Finally the council cried out, “Anathema to the pretended letters of Mennas
and Vigilius! Anathema to the forger of Acts! Anathema to all who teach, etc.”</p>
<p>From all this it would seem that the substantial accuracy of the rest of the acts have been
established by the authority of the Sixth Synod, and Hefele and all recent scholars follow
Mansi’s Paris ms.</p>
<p>It may be well here to add that a most thorough-going attack upon the acts has been
made in late years by Professor Vincenzi, in defence of Pope Vigilius and of Origen. The
reader is referred to his writings on the subject: In Sancti Gregorii Nysseni et Originis scripta
et doctrinam nova defensio; Vigil., Orig., Justin. triumph., in Synod V. (Romæ, 1865.) The
Catholic Dictionary frankly says that this is “an attempt to deny the most patent facts, and
treat some of the chief documents as forgeries,” and “unworthy of serious notice.”301</p>

<p>The effort of my predecessors, the orthodox Emperors, ever aimed at the settling of
controversies which had arisen respecting the faith by the calling of Synods. For this cause
Constantine assembled 318 Fathers at Nice, and was himself present at the Council, and
assisted those who confessed the Son to be consubstantial with the Father. Theodosius, 150
at Constantinople, Theodosius the younger, the Synod of Ephesus, the Emperor Marcian,
the bishops at Chalcedon. As, however, after Marcian’s death, controversies respecting the
Synod of Chalcedon had broken out in several places, the Emperor Leo wrote to all bishops
of all places, in order that everyone might declare his opinion in writing with regard to this
holy Council. Soon afterwards, however, had arisen again the adherents of Nestorius and
Eutyches, and caused great divisions, so that many Churches had broken off communion
with one another. When, now, the grace of God raised us to the throne, we regarded it as
our chief business to unite the Churches again, and to bring the Synod of Chalcedon, together
with the three earlier, to universal acceptance. We have won many who previously opposed
that Synod; others, who persevered in their opposition, we banished, and so restored the
unity of the Church again. But the Nestorians want to impose their heresy upon the Church;
and, as they could not use Nestorius for that purpose, they made haste to introduce their
errors through Theodore of Mopsuestia, the teacher of Nestorius, who taught still more
grievous blasphemies than his. He maintained, e.g., that God the Word was one, and Christ
another. For the same purpose they made use of those impious writings of Theodoret which
were directed against the first Synod of Ephesus, against Cyril and his Twelve Chapters, and
also the shameful letter which Ibas is said to have written. They maintain that this letter
was accepted by the Synod of Chalcedon, and so would free from condemnation Nestorius

<pb n="592"/>
and Theodore who were commended in the letter. If they were to succeed, the Logos could
no longer be said to be “made man,” nor Mary called the Mother (genetrix) of God. We,
therefore, following the holy Fathers, have first asked you in writing to give your judgment
on the three impious chapters named, and you have answered, and have joyfully confessed
the true faith. Because, however, after the condemnation proceeding from you, there are
still some who defend the Three Chapters, therefore we have summoned you to the capital,
that you may here, in common assembly, place again your view in the light of day. When,
for example, Vigilius, Pope of Old Rome, came hither, he, in answer to our questions, repeatedly
anathematised in writing the Three Chapters, and confirmed his steadfastness in
this view by much, even by the condemnation of his deacons, Rusticus and Sebastian. We
possess still his declarations in his own hand. Then he issued his Judicatum, in which he
anathematised the Three Chapters, with the words, Et quoniam, etc. You know that he not
only deposed Rusticus and Sebastian because they defended the Three Chapters, but also
wrote to Valentinian, bishop of Scythia, and Aurelian, bishop of Arles, that nothing might
be undertaken against the Judicatum. When you afterwards came hither at my invitation,
letters were exchanged between you and Vigilius in order to a common assembly.302 But
now he had altered his view, would no longer have a synod, but required that only the three
patriarchs and one other bishop (in communion with the Pope and the three bishops about
him) should decide the matter. In vain we sent several commands to him to take part in
the synod. He rejected also our two proposals, either to call a tribunal for decision, or to
hold a smaller assembly, at which, besides him and his three bishops, every other patriarch
should have place and voice, with from three to five bishops of his diocese.We further
declare that we hold fast to the decrees.<gap reason="omitted"/> of the four Councils, and in every way follow the
holy Fathers, Athanasius, Hilary, Basil, Gregory the Theologian, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose,
Theophilus, John (Chrysostom) of Constantinople, Cyril, Augustine, Proclus, Leo and their
writings on the true faith. As, however, the heretics are resolved to defend Theodore of
Mopsuestia and Nestorius with their impieties, and maintain that that letter of Ibas was received
by the Synod of Chalcedon, so do we exhort you to direct your attention to the impious
writings of Theodore, and especially to his Jewish Creed which was brought forward at
Ephesus and Chalcedon, and anathematized by each synod with those who had so held or
did so hold; and we further exhort you to consider what the holy Fathers have written concerning
him and his blasphemies, as well as what our predecessors have promulgated, as
also what the Church historians have set forth concerning him.303 You will thence see that
he and his heresies have since been condemned and that therefore his name has long since

<pb n="593"/>
been struck from the diptychs of the Church of Mopsuestia. Consider the absurd assertion
that heretics ought not to be anathematized after their deaths; and we exhort you further
to follow in this matter the doctrine of the holy Fathers, who condemned not only living
heretics but also anathematized after their death those who had died in their iniquity, just
as those who had been unjustly condemned they restored after their death and wrote their
names in the sacred diptychs; which took place in the case of John and of Flavian of pious
memory, both of them bishops of Constantinople.304 Moreover we exhort you to examine
the writing of Theodoret and the supposed letter of Ibas, in which the incarnation of the
Word is denied, the expression “Mother of God” and the holy Synod of Ephesus rejected,
Cyril called a heretic, and Theodore and Nestorius defended and praised. And as they say
that the Council of Chalcedon has received this letter, you must compare the declarations
of this Council relating to the faith with the contents of the impious letter. Finally, we entreat
you to accelerate the matter. For he who when asked concerning the right faith, puts off
his answer for a long while, does nothing else but deny the right faith. For in questioning
and answering on things which are of faith, it is not he who is found first or second, but he
who is the more ready with a right confession, that is acceptable to God. May God keep
you, most holy and religious fathers, for many years. Given IV. Nones of May, at Constantinople,
in the xxviith year of the reign of the imperial lord Justinian, the perpetual Augustus,
and in the xiith year after the consulate of the most illustrious Basil.</p>

<p>You know how much care the most invincible Emperor has always had that the contention
raised up by certain persons with regard to the Three Chapters should have a termination.<gap reason="omitted"/> For this intent he has required the most religious Vigilius to assemble with you and
draw up a decree on this matter in accordance with the Orthodox faith. Although therefore,
Vigilius has already frequently condemned the Three Chapters in writing, and has done
this also by word of mouth in the presence of the Emperor, and of the most glorious judges
and of many members of this synod, and has always been ready to smite with anathema the
defenders of Theodore of Mopsuestia, and the letter which was attributed to Ibas, and the
writings of Theodoret which he set forth against the orthodox faith and against the twelve
capitula of the holy Cyril:305 yet he has refused to do this in communion with you and your
synod.</p>
<p>Yesterday Vigilius sent Servus Dei, a most reverend Subdeacon of the Roman Church,
and invited Belisarius,306 Cethegus, as also Justinus and Constantine the most glorious
consuls, as well as bishops Theodore, Ascidas, Benignus, and Phocas, to come to him as he
wished to give through them an answer to the Emperor. They came, but speedily returned
and informed the most pious lord, that we had visited Vigilius, the most religious bishop,
and that he had said to us: “We have called you for this reason, that you may know what
things have been done in the past days. To this end I have written a document about the
disputed Three Chapters, addressed to the most pious Emperor,307 pray be good enough
to read it, and to carry it to his Serenity.” But when we had heard this and had seen the
document written to your serenity, we said to him that we could not by any means receive
any document written to the most pious Emperor without his bidding. “But you have deacons
<note type="footnote">305 Thus far the mss. agree almost word for word. The divergence for the rest is most marked.</note>
<note type="footnote">306 There is some doubt about this name.</note>
<note type="footnote">307 This was the “Constitutum.”</note>

<pb n="595"/>
for running with messages, by whom you can send it.” He, however, said to us: “You now
know that I have made the document.” But we, bishops, answered him: “If your blessedness
is willing to meet together with us and the most holy Patriarchs, and the most religious
bishops, and to treat of the Three Chapters and to give, in unison with us all, a suitable form
of the orthodox faith, as the Holy Apostles and the holy Fathers and the four Councils have
done, we will hold thee as our head, as a father and primate. But if your holiness has drawn
up a document for the Emperor, you have errand-runners, as we have said; send it by them.”
And when he had heard these things from us, he sent Servus Dei the Subdeacon, who now
awaits the answer of your serenity. And when his Piety had heard this, he commanded
through the aforesaid most religious and glorious men, the before-named subdeacon to
carry back this message to the most religious Vigilius: “We invited him (you) to meet together
with the most blessed patriarchs and other religious bishops, and with them in
common to examine and judge the Three Chapters. But since you have refused to do this,
and you say that you alone have written by yourself somewhat on the Three Chapters; if
you have condemned them, in accordance with those things which you did before, we have
already many such statements and need no more; but if you have written now something
contrary to these things which were done by you before, you have condemned yourself by
your own writing, since you have departed from orthodox doctrine and have defended impiety.</p>
<p>And how can you expect us to receive such a document from you?”
And when this answer was given by the most pious Emperor, he did not send through
the same deacon any document in writing from himself. And all this was done without
writing as also to your blessedness.</p>
<p><del>He then, according to all the mss., presented certain documents to be read, in the ms.
printed by Labbe and Cossart, Tom. V., col. 549 et seqq. These are fewer than in the Paris
ms., which last also contains the following just after the reading of the documents and after
the Council had declared that they proved the Emperor’s zeal for the faith.</del></p>
<p>Constantine, the most glorious Quæstor, said: While I am still present at your holy
council by reason of the reading of the documents which have been presented to you, I
would say that the most pious Emperor has sent a minute (formam), to your Holy Synod,
concerning the name of Vigilius, that it be no more inserted in the holy diptychs of the
Church, on account of the impiety which he defended. Neither let it be recited by you, nor
retained, either in the church of the royal city, or in other churches which are intrusted to
you and to the other bishops in the State committed by God to his rule. And when you hear
this minute, again you will perceive by it how much the most serene Emperor cares for the
unity of the holy churches and for the purity of the holy mysteries.</p>
<p><del>The letter was then read.</del></p>

<pb n="596"/>
<p>The holy Synod said: What has seemed good to the most pious Emperor is congruous
to the labours which he bears for the unity of the churches. Let us preserve unity to (ad)
the Apostolic See of the most holy Church of ancient Rome, carrying out all things according
to the tenor of what has been read. De proposita vero quæstione quod jam promisimus

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Hefele understands that the Council heard and approved this letter of the Emperor’s,
but that the “Emperor did not mean entirely to break off communion with the Apostolic
see, neither did he wish the Synod to do so” (Hist. Councils, Vol. IV., p. 326), as indeed he
says in his letter.</p>
<p>The Ballerini consider this letter of the Emperor’s to be spurious, but (says Hefele) “on
insufficient grounds” (l. c., p. 326, note 3). The expressions used by the Emperor may not
unnaturally be somewhat startling to those holding the theological position of the Ballerini:
“We will not endure to receive the spotless communion from him nor from any one else
who does not condemn this impiety…lest we be found thus communicating with the impiety
of Nestorius and Theodore.” It is noteworthy that the Fifth Ecumenical Council should
strike the name of the reigning Pope from the diptychs as a father of heresy; and that the
Sixth Ecumenical Synod should anathematize another Pope as a heretic!</p>

<head>The Sentence of the Synod.</head>
<p>(From the Acts. Collation VIII., L. and C., Conc., Tom. V., col. 562.)</p>
<p>Our Great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, as we learn from the parable in the Gospel,
distributes talents to each man according to his ability, and at the fitting time demands an
account of the work done by every man. And if he to whom but one talent has been committed
is condemned because he has not worked with it but only kept it without loss, to
how much greater and more horrible judgment must he be subject who not only is negligent
concerning himself, but even places a stumbling-block and cause of offence in the way of
others? Since it is manifest to all the faithful that whenever any question arises concerning
the faith, not only the impious man himself is condemned, but also he who when he has the
power to correct impiety in others, neglects to do so.308</p>
<p>We therefore, to whom it has been committed to rule the church of the Lord, fearing
the curse which hangs over those who negligently perform the Lord’s work, hasten to preserve
the good seed of faith pure from the tares of impiety which are being sown by the enemy.</p>
<p>When, therefore, we saw that the followers of Nestorius were attempting to introduce
their impiety into the church of God through the impious Theodore, who was bishop of
Mopsuestia, and through his impious writings; and moreover through those things which
Theodoret impiously wrote, and through the wicked epistle which is said to have been
written by Ibas to Maris the Persian, moved by all these sights we rose up for the correction
of what was going on, and assembled in this royal city called thither by the will of God and
the bidding of the most religious Emperor.</p>
<p>And because it happened that the most religious Vigilius stopping in this royal city, was
present at all the discussions with regard to the Three Chapters, and had often condemned
them orally and in writing, nevertheless afterwards he gave his consent in writing to be
present at the Council and examine together with us the Three Chapters, that a suitable
definition of the right faith might be set forth by us all. Moreover the most pious Emperor,
according to what had seemed good between us, exhorted both him and us to meet together,
because it is comely that the priesthood should after common discussion impose a common
faith. On this account we besought his reverence to fulfil his written promises; for it was
not right that the scandal with regard to these Three Chapters should go any further, and
the Church of God be disturbed thereby. And to this end we brought to his remembrance
the great examples left us by the Apostles, and the traditions of the Fathers. For although
the grace of the Holy Spirit abounded in each one of the Apostles, so that no one of them
needed the counsel of another in the execution of his work, yet they were not willing to
define on the question then raised touching the circumcision of the Gentiles, until being
<note type="footnote">308 This, of course, refers to Pope Vigilius.</note>

<pb n="598"/>
gathered together they had confirmed their own several sayings by the testimony of the divine
Scriptures.</p>
<p>And thus they arrived unanimously at this sentence, which they wrote to the Gentiles:
“It has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no other burden than
these necessary things, that ye abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and
from things strangled, and from fornication.”</p>
<p>But also the Holy Fathers, who from time to time have met in the four holy councils,
following the example of the ancients, have by a common discussion, disposed of by a fixed
decree the heresies and questions which had sprung up, as it was certainly known, that by
common discussion when the matter in dispute was presented by each side, the light of
truth expels the darkness of falsehood.</p>
<p>Nor is there any other way in which the truth can be made manifest when there are
discussions concerning the faith, since each one needs the help of his neighbour, as we read
in the Proverbs of Solomon: “A brother helping his brother shall be exalted like a walled
city; and he shall be strong as a well-founded kingdom;” and again in Ecclesiastes he says:
“Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.”</p>
<p>So also the Lord himself says: “Verily I say unto you that if two of you shall agree upon
earth as touching anything they shall seek for, they shall have it from my Father which is in
heaven. For wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
midst of them.”</p>
<p>But when often he had been invited by us all, and when the most glorious judges had
been sent to him by the most religious Emperor, he promised to give sentence himself on
the Three Chapters (sententiam proferre): And when we heard this answer, having the
Apostle’s admonition in mind, that “each one must give an account of himself to God” and
fearing the judgment that hangs over those who scandalize one, even of the least important,
and knowing how much sorer it must be to give offence to so entirely Christian an Emperor,
and to the people, and to all the Churches; and further recalling what was said by God to
Paul: “Fear not, but speak, and be not silent, for I am with thee, and no one can harm thee.”
Therefore, being gathered together, before all things we have briefly confessed that we hold
that faith which our Lord Jesus Christ, the true God, delivered to his holy Apostles, and
through them to the holy churches, and which they who after them were holy fathers and
doctors, handed down to the people credited to them.</p>
<p>We confessed that we hold, preserve, and declare to the holy churches that confession
of faith which the 318 holy Fathers more at length set forth, who were gathered together at
Nice, who handed down the holy mathema or creed. Moreover, the 150 gathered together
at Constantinople set forth our faith, who followed that same confession of faith and explained
it. And the consent of the 200 holy fathers gathered for the same faith in the first
Council of Ephesus. And what things were defined by the 630 gathered at Chalcedon for

<pb n="599"/>
the one and the same faith, which they both followed and taught. And all those who from
time to time have been condemned or anathematized by the Catholic Church, and by the
aforesaid four Councils, we confessed that we hold them condemned and anathematized.
And when we had thus made profession of our faith we began the examination of the Three
Chapters, and first we brought into review the matter of Theodore of Mopsuestia; and when
all the blasphemies contained in his writings were made manifest, we marvelled at the longsuffering
of God, that the tongue and mind which had framed such blasphemies were not
immediately consumed by the divine fire; and we never would have suffered the reader of
the aforenamed blasphemies to proceed, fearing <del>as we did</del> the indignation of God for their
record alone (as each blasphemy surpassed its predecessor in the magnitude of its impiety
and moved from its foundation the mind of the hearer) had it not been that we saw they
who gloried in such blasphemies stood in need of the confusion which would come upon
them through their manifestation. So that all of us, moved with indignation by these blasphemies
against God, both during and after the reading, broke forth into denunciations
and anathematisms against Theodore, as if he had been living and present. O Lord be
merciful, we cried, not even devils have dared to utter such things against thee.</p>
<p>O intolerable tongue! O the depravity of the man! O that high hand he lifted up against
his Creator! For the wretched man who had promised to know the Scriptures, had no recollection
of the words of the Prophet Hosea, “Woe unto them! for they have fled from me:
they are become famous because they were impious as touching me; they spake iniquities
against me, and when they had thought them out, they spake the violent things against me.
Therefore shall they fall in the snare by reason of the wickedness of their own tongues.
Their contempt shall turn into their own bosom: because they have transgressed my covenant
and have acted impiously against my laws.”</p>
<p>To these curses the impious Theodore is justly subject. For the prophecies concerning
Christ he rejected and hastened to destroy, so far as he had the power, the great mystery of
the dispensation for our salvation; attempting in many ways to show the divine words to
be nothing but fables, for the mirth of the gentiles, and spurned the other prophetic announcements
made against the impious, especially that which the divine Habacuc said of
those who teach falsely, “Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
bottle to him and makest him drunken that thou mayest look on their nakedness,” that is,
their doctrines full of darkness and altogether foreign to the light.</p>
<p>And why should we add anything further? For anyone can take in his hands the writings
of the impious Theodore or the impious chapters which from his impious writings were
inserted by us in our acts, and find the incredible foolishness and the detestable things which
he said. For we are afraid to proceed further and again to remember these infamies.</p>
<p>There was also read to us what had been written by the holy Fathers against him, and
his foolishness which exceeded that of all heretics, and moreover the histories and the im-

<pb n="600"/>
perial laws, setting forth his impiety from the beginning, and since after all these things the
defenders of his impiety, glorying in the injuries uttered by him against his Creator, said
that it was not right to anathematize him after death, although we knew the ecclesiastical
tradition concerning the impious, that even after death, heretics are anathematized; nevertheless
we thought it necessary concerning this also to make examination, and there were
found in the acts how divers heretics had been anathematized after death; and in many ways
it was manifest to us that those who were saying this cared nothing for the judgment of God,
nor for the Apostolic announcements, nor for the tradition of the Fathers. And we would
like to ask them what they have to say to the Lord’s having said of himself: “Whosoever
should have believed in him, is not judged: but who should not have believed in him is
judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God,”
and of that exclamation of the Apostle: Although we or an angel from heaven were to preach
to you another gospel than that we have preached unto you, let him be anathema: as we
have said, so now I say again, If anyone preach to you another gospel than that you have
received, let him be anathema.”</p>
<p>For when the Lord says: “he is judged already,” and when the Apostle anathematizes
even angels, if they teach anything different from what we have preached, how can even
those who dare all things, presume to say that these words refer only to the living? or are
they ignorant, or is it not rather that they feign to be ignorant, that the judgment of anathema
is nothing else than that of separation from God? For the impious person, although he may
not have been verbally anathematized by anyone, nevertheless he really is anathematized,
having separated himself from the true life by his impiety.</p>
<p>For what have they to answer to the Apostle again when he says, “A man that is an
heretic reject after the first and second corrections. Knowing that such a man is perverse,
and sins, and is condemned by himself.”</p>
<p>In accordance with which words Cyril of blessed memory, in the books which he wrote
against Theodore, says as follows: They are to be avoided who are in the grasp of such awful
crimes whether they be among the quick or not. For it is necessary always to flee from that
which is hurtful, and not to have respect of persons, but to consider what is pleasing to God.
And again the same Cyril of holy memory, writing to John, bishop of Antioch, and to the
synod assembled in that city concerning Theodore who was anathematized together with
Nestorius, says thus: It was therefore necessary to keep a brilliant festival, since every voice
which agreed with the blasphemies of Nestorius had been cast out no matter whose. For it
proceeded against all those who held these same opinions or had at one time held them,
which is exactly what we and your holiness have said: We anathematize those who say that
there are two Sons and two Christs. For one is he who is preached by us and you, as we
have said, Christ, the Son and Lord, only begotten as man, according to the saying of the
most learned Paul. And also in his letter to Alexander and Martinian and John and

<pb n="601"/>
Paregorius and Maximus, presbyters and monastic fathers, and those who with them were
leading the solitary life, he so says: The holy synod of Ephesus, gathered together according
to the will of God against the Nestorian perfidy with a just and keen sentence condemned
together with him the empty words of those who afterwards should embrace or who had in
time past embraced the same opinions with him, and who presumed to say or write any
such thing, laying upon them an equal condemnation. For it followed naturally that when
one was condemned for such profane emptiness of speech, the sentence should not come
against one only, but (so to speak) against every one of their heresies or calumnies, which
they utter against the pious doctrines of the Christ, worshipping two Sons, and dividing the
indivisible, and bringing in the crime of man-worship (anthropolatry), both into heaven
and earth. For with us the holy multitude of the supernal spirits adore one Lord Jesus Christ.
Moreover several letters of Augustine, of most religious memory, who shone forth resplendent
among the African bishops, were read, shewing that it was quite right that heretics should
be anathematized after death. And this ecclesiastical tradition, the other most reverend
bishops of Africa have preserved: and the holy Roman Church as well had anathematized
certain bishops after their death, although they had not been accused of any falling from
the faith during their lives: and of each we have the evidence in our hands.</p>
<p>But since the disciples of Theodore and of his impiety, who are so manifestly enemies
of the truth, have attempted to bring forward certain passages of Cyril of holy memory and
of Proclus, as though they had been written in favour of Theodore, it is opportune to fit to
them the words of the prophet when he says: “The ways of the Lord are right and the just
walk therein; but the wicked shall be weak in them.” For these, evilly receiving the things
which have been well and opportunely written by the holy Fathers, and making excuses in
their sins, quote these words. The fathers do not appear as delivering Theodore from anathema,
but rather as economically using certain expressions on account of those who defended
Nestorius and his impiety, in order to draw them away from this error, and to lead them
to perfection and to teach them to condemn not only Nestorius, the disciple of the impiety,
but also his teacher Theodore. So in these very words of economy the Fathers shew their
intention on this point, that Theodore should be anathematized, as has been abundantly
demonstrated by us in our acts from the writings of Cyril and Proclus of holy memory with
regard to the condemnation of Theodore and his impiety. And such economy is found in
divine Scripture: and it is evident that Paul the Apostle made use of this in the beginning
of his ministry, in relation to those who had been brought up as Jews, and circumcised
Timothy, that by this economy and condescension he might lead them on to perfection.
But afterwards he forbade circumcision, writing thus to the Galatians: “Behold, I Paul say
to you, that if ye be circumcised Christ profiteth you nothing.” But we found that that which
heretics were wont to do, the defenders of Theodore had done also. For cutting out certain
of the things which the holy Fathers had written, and placing with them and mixing up

<pb n="602"/>
certain false things of their own, they have tried by a letter of Cyril of holy memory as though
from a testimony of the Fathers, to free from anathema the aforesaid impious Theodore:
in which very passages the truth was demonstrated, when the parts which had been cut off
were read in their proper order, and the falsehood was thoroughly evinced by the collation
of the true. But in all these things, they who spake such vanities, “trusted in falsehood,” as
it is written, “they trust in falsehood, and speak vanity; they conceive grief and bring forth
iniquity, weaving the spider’s web.” When we had thus considered Theodore and his impiety,
we took care to have recited and inserted in our acts a few of these things which had been
impiously written by Theodoret against the right faith and against the Twelve Chapters of
St. Cyril and against the First Council of Ephesus, also certain things written by him in defence
of those impious ones Theodore and Nestorius, for the satisfaction of the reader; that
all might know that these had been justly cast out and anathematized. In the third place
the letter which is said to have been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian, was brought forward
for examination, and we found that it, too, should be read. When it was read immediately
its impiety was manifest to all. And it was right to make the condemnation and anathematism
of the aforesaid Three Chapters, as even to this time there had been some question on the
subject. But because the defenders of these impious ones, Theodore and Nestorius, were
scheming in some way or other to confirm these persons and their impiety, and were saying
that this impious letter, which praised and defended Theodore and Nestorius and their
impiety, had been received by the holy Council of Chalcedon we thought it necessary to
shew that the holy synod was free of the impiety which was contained in that letter, that it
might be clear that they who say such things do not do so with the favour of this holy
council, but that through its name they may confirm their own impiety. And it was shewn
in the acts that in former times Ibas had been accused because of the very impiety which is
contained in this letter; at first by Proclus, of holy memory, the bishop of Constantinople,
and afterwards by Theodosius, of pious memory, and by Flavian, who was ordained bishop
in succession to Proclus, who delegated the examination of the matter to Photius, bishop
of Tyre, and to Eustathius, bishop of the city of Beyroot. Afterwards the same Ibas, being
found guilty, was cast out of his bishopric. Such was the state of the case, how could anyone
presume to say that that impious letter was received by the holy council of Chalcedon and
that the holy council of Chalcedon agreed with it throughout? Nevertheless in order that
they who thus calumniate the holy council of Chalcedon may have no further opportunity
of doing so, we ordered to be recited the decisions of the holy Synods, to wit, of first Ephesus,
and of Chalcedon, with regard to the Epistles of Cyril of blessed memory and of Leo, of pious
memory, sometime Pope of Old Rome. And since we had learned from these that nothing
written by anyone else ought to be received unless it had been proved to agree with the orthodox
faith of the holy Fathers, we interrupted our proceedings so as to recite also the
definition of the faith which was set forth by the holy council of Chalcedon, so that we might

<pb n="603"/>
compare the things in the epistle with this decree. And when this was done it was perfectly
clear that the contents of the epistle were wholly opposite to those of the definition.</p>
<p>For the definition agreed with the one and unchanging faith set forth as well by the 318
holy Fathers as by the 150 and by those who assembled at the first synod at Ephesus. But
that impious letter, on the other hand, contained the blasphemies of the heretics Theodore
and Nestorius, and defended them, and calls them doctors, while it calls the holy Fathers
heretics.</p>
<p>And this we made manifest to all, that we did not have any intention of omitting the
Fathers of the first and second interlocutions, which the followers of Theodore and
Nestorius cited on their side, but these and all the others having been read and their contents
examined, we found that the aforesaid Ibas was not allowed to be received without being
compelled to anathematize Nestorius and his impious teachings, which were defended in
that epistle. And this the rest of the religious bishops of the aforesaid holy Council did as
well as those two whose interlocutions certain tried to use.</p>
<p>For this they observed in the case of Theodoret, and required him to anathematize those
things of which he was accused. If therefore they were willing to allow the reception of Ibas
in no other manner unless he condemned the impiety which was contained in his letters,
and subscribed the definition of faith adopted by the Council, how can they attempt to make
out that this impious letter was received by the same holy council? For we are taught, “What
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with
darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth
with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols.”</p>
<p>Having thus detailed all that has been done by us, we again confess that we receive the
four holy Synods, that is, the Nicene, the Constantinopolitan, the first of Ephesus, and that
of Chalcedon, and we have taught, and do teach all that they defined respecting the one
faith. And we account those who do not receive these things aliens from the Catholic
Church. Moreover we condemn and anathematize, together with all the other heretics who
have been condemned and anathematized by the before-mentioned four holy Synods, and
by the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, Theodore who was Bishop of Mopsuestia, and
his impious writings, and also those things which Theodoret impiously wrote against the
right faith, and against the Twelve Chapters of the holy Cyril, and against the first Synod of
Ephesus, and also those which he wrote in defence of Theodore and Nestorius. In addition
to these we also anathematize the impious Epistle which Ibas is said to have written to
Maris, the Persian, which denies that God the Word was incarnate of the holy Mother of
God, and ever Virgin Mary, and accuses Cyril of holy memory, who taught the truth, as an
heretic, and of the same sentiments with Apollinaris, and blames the first Synod of Ephesus
as deposing Nestorius without examination and inquiry, and calls the Twelve Chapters of
the holy Cyril impious, and contrary to the right faith, and defends Theodorus and

<pb n="604"/>
Nestorius, and their impious dogmas and writings. We therefore anathematize the Three
Chapters before-mentioned, that is, the impious Theodore of Mopsuestia, with his execrable
writings, and those things which Theodoret impiously wrote, and the impious letter which
is said to be of Ibas, and their defenders, and those who have written or do write in defence
of them, or who dare to say that they are correct, and who have defended or attempt to defend
their impiety with the names of the holy Fathers, or of the holy Council of Chalcedon. These
things therefore being settled with all accuracy, we, bearing in remembrance the promises
made respecting the holy Church, and who it was that said that the gates of hell should not
prevail against her, that is, the deadly tongues of heretics; remembering also what was
prophesied respecting it by Hosea, saying, “I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and
thou shalt know the Lord,” and numbering together with the devil, the father of lies, the
unbridled tongues of heretics who persevered in their impiety unto death, and their most
impious writings, will say to them, “Behold, all ye kindle a fire, and cause the flame of the
fire to grow strong, ye shall walk in the light of your fire, and the flame which ye kindle.”
But we, having a commandment to exhort the people with right doctrine, and to speak to
the heart of Jerusalem, that is, the Church of God, do rightly make haste to sow in righteousness,
and to reap the fruit of life; and kindling for ourselves the light of knowledge from the
holy Scriptures, and the doctrine of the Fathers, we have considered it necessary to comprehend
in certain Capitula, both the declaration of the truth, and the condemnation of heretics,
and of their wickedness.</p>

is only one Person, to wit: our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the Holy Trinity: let him be anathema.
As a matter of fact the word “union” (τῆς ἑνώςεως) has many meanings, and the
partisans of Apollinaris and Eutyches have affirmed that these natures are confounded inter
se, and have asserted a union produced by the mixture of both. On the other hand the followers
of Theodorus and of Nestorius rejoicing in the division of the natures, have taught
only a relative union. Meanwhile the Holy Church of God, condemning equally the impiety
of both sorts of heresies, recognises the union of God the Word with the flesh synthetically,
that is to say, hypostatically. For in the mystery of Christ the synthetical union not only
preserves unconfusedly the natures which are united, but also allows no separation.</p>

<p>(Hist. Councils, Vol. iv., p. 336.)</p>
<p>Halloix, Garnier, Basnage, Walch and others suppose, and Vincenzi maintains with
great zeal, that the name of Origen is a later insertion in this anathematism, because (a)
Theodore Ascidas, the Origenist, was one of the most influential members of the Synod,
and would certainly have prevented a condemnation of Origen; further, (b) because in this
anathematism only such heretics would be named as had been condemned by one of the
first four Ecumenical Synods, which was not the case with Origen; (c) because this anathematism
is identical with the tenth in the ὁμολογία of the Emperor, but in the latter the name
of Origen is lacking; and, finally, (d) because Origen does not belong to the group of heretics
to whom this anathematism refers. His errors were quite different.</p>
<p>All these considerations seem to me of insufficient strength, or mere conjecture, to make
an alteration in the text, and arbitrarily to remove the name of Origen. As regards the ob-

<pb n="609"/>
jection in connection with Theodore Ascidas, it is known that the latter had already pronounced
a formal anathema on Origen, and certainly he did the same this time, if the Emperor
wished it or if it seemed advisable. The second and fourth objections have little weight.
In regard to the third (c) it is quite possible that either the Emperor subsequently went further
than in his ὁμολογία, or that the bishops at the fifth Synod, of their own accord, added
Origen, led on perhaps by one or another anti-Origenist of their number. What, however,
chiefly determines us to the retention of the text is: (a) that the copy of the synodal Acts
extant in the Roman archives, which has the highest credibility, and was probably prepared
for Vigilius himself, contains the name of Origen in the eleventh anathematism; and (b)
that the monks of the new Lama in Palestine, who are known to have been zealous Origenists,
withdrew Church communion from the bishops of Palestine after these had subscribed the
Acts of the fifth Synod. In the anathema on the Three Chapters these Origenists could find
as little ground for such a rupture as their friends and former colleague Ascidas; it could
only be by the synod attacking their darling Origen. (c) Finally, only on the ground that
the name of Origen really stood in the eleventh anathematism, can we explain the widelycirculated
ancient rumour that our Synod anathematized Origen and the Origenists.</p>

<p>If anyone defends the impious Theodore of Mopsuestia, who has said that the Word of
God is one person, but that another person is Christ, vexed by the sufferings of the soul and
the desires of the flesh, and separated little by little above that which is inferior, and become
better by the progress in good works and irreproachable in his manner of life, as a mere
man was baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and
obtained by this baptism the grace of the Holy Spirit, and became worthy of Sonship, and
to be worshipped out of regard to the Person of God the Word (just as one worships the
image of an emperor) and that he is become, after the resurrection, unchangeable in his
thoughts and altogether without sin. And, again, this same impious Theodore has also said
that the union of God the Word with Christ is like to that which, according to the doctrine
of the Apostle, exists between a man and his wife, “They twain shall be in one flesh.” The
same <del>Theodore</del> has dared, among numerous other blasphemies, to say that when after the
resurrection the Lord breathed upon his disciples, saying, “Receive the Holy Ghost,” he did
not really give them the Holy Spirit, but that he breathed upon them only as a sign. He
likewise has said that the profession of faith made by Thomas when he had, after the resurrection,
touched the hands and the side of the Lord, viz.: “My Lord and my God,” was not
said in reference to Christ, but that Thomas, filled with wonder at the miracle of the resurrection,
thus thanked God who had raised up Christ. And moreover (which is still more
scandalous) this same Theodore in his Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles compares
Christ to Plato, Manichæus, Epicurus and Marcion, and says that as each of these men

<pb n="610"/>
having discovered his own doctrine, had given his name to his disciples, who were called
Platonists, Manicheans, Epicureans and Marcionites, just so Christ, having discovered his
doctrine, had given the name Christians to his disciples. If, then, anyone shall defend this
most impious Theodore and his impious writings, in which he vomits the blasphemies
mentioned above, and countless others besides against our Great God and Saviour Jesus
Christ, and if anyone does not anathematize him or his impious writings, as well as all those

<head>Excursus on the XV. Anathemas Against Origen.</head>
<p>That Origen was condemned by name in the Eleventh Canon of this council there seems
no possible reason to doubt. I have given in connexion with that canon a full discussion of
the evidence upon which our present text rests. But there arises a further question, to wit,
Did the Fifth Synod examine the case of Origen and finally adopt the XV. Anathemas against
him which are usually found assigned to it? It would seem that with the evidence now in
our possession it would be the height of rashness to give a dogmatic answer to this question.
Scholars of the highest repute have taken, and do take to-day, the opposite sides of the case,
and each defends his own side with marked learning and ability. To my mind the chief
difficulty in supposing these anathematisms to have been adopted by the Fifth Ecumenical
is that nothing whatever is said about Origen in the call of the council, nor in any of the
letters written in connexion with it; all of which would seem unnatural had there been a
long discussion upon the matter, and had such an important dogmatic definition been adopted
as the XV. Anathemas, and yet on the other hand there is a vast amount of literature
subsequent in date to the council which distinctly attributes a detailed and careful examination
of the teaching of Origen and a formal condemnation of him and of it to this council.</p>
<p>The XV. Anathemas as we now have them were discovered by Peter Lambeck, the Librarian
of Vienna, in the XVIIth century; and bear, in the Vienna ms., the heading, “Canons,
of the 165 holy Fathers of the holy fifth Synod, held in Constantinople.” But despite this,
Walch (Ketzerhist., Vol. vii., p. 661 et seqq. and 671; Vol. viij., p. 281 et seqq.); Döllinger
(Church History, Eng. Trans., Vol. v., p. 203 et seqq.); Hefele (Hist. Councils, Vol. iv., p. 221
sq.), and many others look upon this caption as untrustworthy. Evagrius, the historian,
distinctly says that Origen was condemned with special anathemas at this Council, but his
evidence is likewise (and, as it seems to me, too peremptorily) set aside.</p>
<p>Cardinal Noris, in his Dissertatio Historica de Synodo Quinta, is of opinion that Origen
was twice condemned by the Fifth Synod; the first time by himself before the eight sessions
of which alone the acts remain, and again after those eight sessions, in connexion with two
of his chief followers, Didymus the Blind and the deacon Evagrius. The Jesuit, John
Garnier wrote in opposition to Noris; but his work, while exceedingly clever, is considered
by the learned to contain (as Hefele says) “many statements [which] are rash, arbitrary, and
inaccurate, and on the whole it is seen to be written in a spirit of opposition to Noris.”312
In defence of Noris’s main contention came forward the learned Ballerini brothers, of Verona.
In their Defensio dissertationis Norisianæ de Syn. V. adv. diss. P. Garnerii, they expand
and amend Noris’s hypothesis. But after all is said the matter remains involved in the greatest
obscurity, and it is far easier to bring forward objections to the arguments in defence of
either view than to bring forward a theory which will satisfy all the conditions of the problem.</p>
<note type="footnote">312 Hefele. Hist. Councils, Vol. IV., p. 230, note.</note>

<pb n="613"/>
<p>Those who deny that the XV. Anathemas were adopted by the Fifth Synod agree in assigning
them to the “Home Synod,” that is a Synod at Constantinople of the bishops subject
to it, in a.d. 543. Hefele takes this view and advocates it with much cogency, but confesses
frankly, “We certainly possess no strong and decisive proof that the fifteen anathematisms
belong to the Constantinopolitan synod of the year 543; but some probable grounds for the
opinion may be adduced.”313 This appears to be a somewhat weak statement with which
to overthrow so much evidence as there can be produced for the opposite view. For the
traditional view the English reader will find a complete defence in E. B. Pusey, What is of
Faith with regard to Eternal Punishment?</p>
<p>Before closing it will be well to call the attention of the reader to these words now found
in the acts as we have them:</p>
<p>“And we found that many others had been anathematised after death, also even Origen;
and if any one were to go back to the times of Theophilus of blessed memory or further he
would have found him anathematised after death; which also now your holiness and Vigilius,
the most religious Pope of Old Rome has done in his case.”314 It would seem that this
cannot possibly refer to anything else than a condemnation of Origen by the Fifth Ecumenical
Synod, and so strongly is Vincenzi, Origen’s defender, impressed with this that he declares
the passage to have been tampered with. But even if these anathemas were adopted at the
Home Synod before the meeting of the Fifth Ecumenical, it is clear that by including his
name among those of the heretics in the XIth Canon, it practically ratified and made its own
the action of that Synod.</p>
<p>The reader will be glad to know Harnack’s judgment in this matter. Writing of the Fifth
Council, he says: “It condemned Origen, as Justinian desired; it condemned the Three

to rehabilitate Origen and Vigilius, and on the other hand to ‘remodel’ the Council and
partly to bring it into contempt.”316 Further on he says: “The fifteen anathemas against

<head>The Decretal Epistle of Pope Vigilius in Confirmation of the Fifth
Ecumenical Synod.</head>
<head>Historical Note.</head>
<p>(Fleury. Hist. Eccl., Liv. xxxiii. 52.)</p>
<p>At last the Pope Vigilius resigned himself to the advice of the Council, and six months
afterwards wrote a letter to the Patriarch Eutychius, wherein he confesses that he has been
wanting in charity in dividing from his brethren. He adds, that one ought not to be ashamed
to retract, when one recognises the truth, and brings forward the example of Augustine.
He says, that, after having better examined the matter of the Three Chapters, he finds them
worthy of condemnation. “We recognize for our brethren and colleagues all those who
have condemned them, and annul by this writing all that has been done by us or by others
for the defence of the three chapters.”</p>

<pb n="622"/>
<head>The Decretal Letter of Pope Vigilius.</head>
<p>(The manuscript from which this letter was printed was found in the Royal Library of
Paris by Peter de Marca and by him first published, with a Latin translation and with a dissertation.
Both of these with the Greek text are found in Labbe and Cossart’s Concilia, Tom.
V., col. 596 et seqq.; also in Migne’s Patr. Lat., Tom. LXIX., col. 121 et seqq. Some doubts
have been expressed about its genuineness and Harduin is of opinion that the learned Jesuit,
Garnerius, in his notes on the Deacon Leberatus’s Breviary, has proved its supposititious
character. But the learned have not generally been of this mind but have accepted the letter
as genuine.)</p>
<p>Vigilius to his beloved brother Eutychius.</p>
<p>No one is ignorant of the scandals which the enemy of the human race has stirred up
in all the world: so that he made each one with a wicked object in view, striving in some
way to fulfil his wish to destroy the Church of God spread over the whole world, not only
in his own name but even in ours and in those of others to compose diverse things as well
in words as in writing; in so much that he attempted to divide us who, together with our
brethren and fellow bishops, are stopping in this royal city, and who defend with equal
reverence the four synods, and sincerely persist in the one and the same faith of those four
synods, by his sophistries and machinations he tried to part from them; so that we ourselves
who were and are of the same opinion as they touching the faith, went apart into discord,
brotherly love being despised.321</p>
<p>But since Christ our God, who is the true light, whom the darkness comprehendeth
not, hath removed all confusion from our minds, and hath so recalled peace to the whole
world and to the Church, so that what things should be defined by us have been healthfully
fulfilled through the revelation of the Lord and through the investigation of the truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, my dear brothers, I do you to wit, that in common with all of you, our
brethren, we receive in all respects the four synods, that is to say the Nicene, the Constantinopolitan,
the first Ephesian, and the Chalcedonian; and we venerate them with devout mind,
and watch over them with all our mind. And should there be any who do not follow these
holy synods in all things which they have defined concerning the faith, we judge them to
be aliens to the communion of the holy and Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Wherefore on account of our desire that you, my brothers, should know what we have
done in this matter, we make it known to you by this letter. For no one can doubt how
many were the discussions raised on account of the Three Chapters, that is, concerning
<note type="footnote">321 In this sentence I have followed De Marca’s Latin version, but I must confess that I am not at all satisfied
with the construing of the long phrase beginning Οὕτως ὠς.</note>

<pb n="623"/>
Theodore, sometime bishop of Mopsuestia, and his writings, as well as concerning the
writings of Theodoret, and concerning that letter which is said to have been written by Ibas
to Maris the Persian: and how diverse were the things spoken and written concerning these
Three Chapters. Now if in every business sound wisdom demands that there should be a
retractation of what was propounded after examination, there ought to be no shame when
what was at first omitted is made public after it is discovered by a further study of the truth.
<del>And if this is the case in ordinary affairs</del> how much more in ecclesiastical strifes should
the same dictate of sound reason be observed? Especially since it is manifest that our Fathers,
and especially the blessed Augustine, who was in very sooth illustrious in the Divine Scriptures,
and a master in Roman eloquence, retracted some of his own writings, and corrected
some of his own sayings, and added what he had omitted and afterward found out. We, led
by their example never gave over the study of the questions raised by the controversy with
regard to the before-mentioned Three Chapters, nor our search for passages in the writings
of our Fathers which were applicable to the matter.</p>
<p>As a result of this investigation it became evident that in the sayings of Theodore of
Mopsuestia (which are spoken against on all hands) there are contained very many things
contrary to the right faith and to the teachings of the holy Fathers; and for this very reason
these same holy Fathers have left for the instruction of the Church treatises which they had
written against him.</p>
<p>For among other blasphemies of his we find that he openly said that God the Word was
one <del>Person</del> and Christ another <del>Person</del>, vexed with the passions of the soul and with the
desires of the flesh, and that he little by little advanced from a lower to a higher stage of excellence
by the improvement (προκοπῇ, per profectum operum) of his works, and became
irreprehensible in his manner of life.322 And further he taught that it was a mere man who
was baptized in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and that he
received through his baptism the grace of the Holy Spirit, and merited his adoption; and
therefore that Christ could be venerated in the same way that the image of the Emperor is
venerated as being the persona (εἰς πρόσωπον) of God the Word. And he also taught that
<del>only</del> after his resurrection he became immutable in his thoughts and altogether impeccable.</p>
<p>Moreover he said that the union of the Word of God was made with Christ as the Apostle
says the union is made between a man and his wife: They twain shall be one flesh; and that
after his resurrection, when the Lord breathed upon his disciples and said, Receive the Holy
Ghost, he did not give to them the Holy Spirit. In like strain of profanity he dared to say
that the confession which Thomas made, when he touched the hands and side of the Lord
after his resurrection, saying, My Lord and my God, did not apply to Christ (for Theodore
<note type="footnote">322 The reader will notice that this is hardly distinguishable from the “moral growth” and “ethical development”
which the modern “kenotists” attribute to the Incarnate Son of God.</note>

<pb n="624"/>
did not acknowledge Christ to be God); but that Thomas gave glory to God being filled with
wonder at the miracle of the resurrection, and so said these words.</p>
<p>But what is still worse is this, that in interpreting the Acts of the Apostles, Theodore
makes Christ like to Plato, and Manichæus, and Epicurus, and Marcian, saying: Just as each
of these were the authors of their own peculiar teachings, and called their disciples after
their own names, Platonists, and Manichæans, and Epicureans, and Marcionites, just so
Christ invented dogmas and called his followers Christians after himself.</p>
<p>Let therefore the whole Catholic Church know that justly and irreproachably we have
arrived at the conclusions contained in this our constitution. Wherefore we condemn and
anathematize Theodore, formerly bishop of Mopsuestia, and his impious writings, together
with all other heretics, who (as is manifest) have been condemned and anathematized by
the four holy Synods aforesaid, and by the Catholic Church: also the writings of Theodoret
which are opposed to the right faith, and are against the Twelve Chapters of St. Cyril, and
against the first Council of Ephesus, which were written by him in defence of Theodore and
Nestorius.</p>
<p>Moreover we anathematize and condemn the letter to the Persian heretic Maris, which
is said to have been written by Ibas, which denies that Christ the Word was incarnate of the
holy Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, and was made man, but declares that a mere
man was born of her, and this man it styles a temple, so from this we are given to understand
that God the Word is one <del>Person</del> and Christ another <del>Person</del>. Moreover it calumniates
Saint Cyril, the master and herald of the orthodox faith, calling him a heretic, and charging
him with writing things similar to Apollinaris; and it reviles the first Synod of Ephesus, as
having condemned Nestorius without deliberation or investigation; it likewise declares the
twelve chapters of St. Cyril to be impious and contrary to the right faith; and further still it
defends Theodore and Nestorius, and their impious teachings and writings.</p>
<p>Therefore we anathematize and condemn the aforesaid impious Three Chapters, towit,
the impious Theodore of Mopsuestia and his impious writings; And all that Theodoret
impiously wrote, as well as the letter said to have been written by Ibas, in which are contained
the above mentioned profane blasphemies. We likewise subject to anathema whoever shall
at any time believe that these chapters should be received or defended; or shall attempt to
subvert this present condemnation.</p>
<p>And further we define that they are our brethren and fellow-priests who ever keep the
right faith set forth by those afore-mentioned synods, and shall have condemned the abovenamed
Three Chapters, or even do now condemn them.</p>
<p>And further we annul and evacuate by this present written definition of ours whatever
has been said by me (a me) or by others in defence of the aforesaid Three Chapters.</p>
<p>Far be it from the Catholic Church that anyone should say that all the blasphemies above
related or they who held and followed such things, were received by the before-mentioned

<pb n="625"/>
four synods or by any one of them. For it is most clear, that no one was admitted by the
before-mentioned holy Fathers and especially by the Council of Chalcedon, about whom
there was any suspicion, unless he had first repelled the above-named blasphemies and all
like to them, or else had denied and condemned the heresy or blasphemies of which he was
suspected.</p>

<p>Pope Vigilius died on his way home, but not until, as we have seen, he had accepted
and approved the action of the council in doing exactly that which he “by the authority of
the Apostolic See” in his Constitutum had forbidden it to do.324 He died at the end of 554
or the beginning of 555.</p>
<p>Pelagius I., who succeeded him in the See of Rome, likewise confirmed the Acts of the
Fifth Synod. The council however was not received in all parts of the West, although it had
obtained the approval of the Pope. It was bitterly opposed in the whole of the north of Italy,
in England, France, and Spain, and also in Africa and Asia. The African opposition died
out by 559, but Milan was in schism until 571, when Pope Justin II. published his
“Henoticon.” In Istria the matter was still more serious, and when in 607 the bishop of
Aquileia-Grado with those of his suffragans who were subject to the Empire made their
submission and were reconciled to the Church, the other bishops of his jurisdiction set up
a schismatical Patriarchate at old Aquileia, and this schism continued till the Council of
Aquileia in 700. But before this the II. Council of Constantinople was received all the world
over as the Fifth Ecumenical Council; and was fully recognized as such by the Sixth Council
in 680.</p>
<note type="footnote">324 The last sentence of the Constitutum, the sentence which the Pope gave and which the council rejected,
is as follows: “We ordain and decree that it be permitted to no one who stands in ecclesiastical order of office,
to write or bring forward, or undertake, or teach anything contrary to the contents of this Constitutum in regard
to the Three Chapters, or, after this declaration begin a new controversy about them. And if anything has already
been done or spoken in regard of the Three Chapters in contradiction of this our ordinance by anyone whomsoever,
this we declare void by the authority of the Apostolic See.” It is perfectly clear that the Emperor is the
“anyone” referred to.</note>

<head>Historical Introduction.</head>
<p>The Sixth Ecumenical Council met on November 7, 680, for its first session, and ended
its meetings, which are said to have been eighteen in number, on September 16th of the
next year. The number of bishops present was under three hundred and the minutes of the
last session have only 174 signatures attached to them.</p>
<p>When the Emperor first summoned the council he had no intention that it should be
ecumenical. From the Sacras it appears that he had summoned all the Metropolitans and
bishops of the jurisdiction of Constantinople, and had also informed the Archbishop of
Antioch that he might send Metropolitans and bishops. A long time before he had written
to Pope Agatho on the subject.</p>
<p>When the synod assembled however, it assumed at its first session the title “Ecumenical,”
and all the five patriarchs were represented, Alexandria and Jerusalem having sent deputies
although they were at the time in the hands of the infidel.</p>
<p>In this Council the Emperor presided in person surrounded by high court officials. On
his right sat the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch and next to them the representative
of the Patriarch of Alexandria. On the Emperor’s left were seated the representatives
of the Pope. In the midst were placed, as usual, the Holy Gospels. After the eleventh session
however the Emperor was no longer able to be present, but returned and presided at the
closing meeting.</p>
<p>The sessions of the council were held in the domed hall (or possibly chapel) in the imperial
palace; which, the Acts tell us, was called Trullo (ἐν τῳ σεκρέτω τοῦ θείου παλατίου,
τῳ οὕτω λεγομένῳ Τρόυλλῳ).</p>
<p>It may be interesting to remark that the Sacras sent to the bishops of Rome and Constantinople
are addressed, the one to “The Most holy and Blessed Archbishop of Old Rome
and Ecumenical Pope,” and the other to “The Most holy and Blessed Archbishop of Constantinople
and Ecumenical Patriarch.” Some of the titles given themselves by the signers
of the “Prosphoneticus” are interesting—“George, an humble presbyter of the holy Roman
Church, and holding the place of the most blessed Agatho, ecumenical Pope of the City of
Rome<gap reason="omitted"/>,” “John, an humble deacon of the holy Roman Church and holding the place of
the most blessed Agatho, and ecumenical Pope of the City of Rome<gap reason="omitted"/>,” “George, by the

<p><del>After a history of the assembly of the Council, the Acts begin with the Speech of the Papal
Legates, as follows:</del></p>
<p>Most benign lord, in accordance with the Sacra to our most holy Pope325 from your
God-instructed majesty, we have been sent by him to the most holy footsteps of your Godconfirmed
serenity, bearing with us his suggestion (ἀναφορᾶς, suggestione) as well as the
other suggestion of his Synod equally addressed to your divinely preserved Piety by the
venerable bishops subject to it, which also we offered to your God-crowned Fortitude. Since,
then, during the past forty-six years, more or less, certain novelties in expression, contrary
to the Orthodox faith, have been introduced by those who were at several times bishops of
this, your royal and God-preserved city, to wit: Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also
by Cyrus, at one time archbishop of the city of Alexandria, as well also as by Theodore, who
was bishop of a city called Pharan, and by certain others their followers, and since these
things have in no small degree brought confusion into the Church throughout the whole
world, for they taught dogmatically that there was but one will in the dispensation of the
Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the Holy Trinity, and one operation; and since
many times your servant, our apostolic see, has fought against this, and then prayed against
it, and by no means been able, even up to now, to draw away from such a depraved opinion
its advocates, we beseech your God-crowned fortitude, that such as share these views of the
most holy church of Constantinople may tell us, what is the source of this new-fangled
language.</p>
<p><del>Answer of the Monothelites made at the Emperor’s bidding:</del></p>
<p>We have brought out no new method of speech, but have taught whatever we have received
from the holy Ecumenical Synods, and from the holy approved Fathers, as well as
from the archbishops of this imperial city, to wit: Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also
from Honorius who was Pope of Old Rome, and from Cyrus who was Pope of Alexandria,
that is to say with reference to will and operation, and so we have believed, and so we believe,
so we preach; and further we are ready to stand by, and defend this faith.</p>

<head>The Letter of Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, to the Emperor, and the
Letter of Agatho and of 125 Bishops of the Roman Synod, Addressed
to the Sixth Council.</head>
<p>(Read at the Fourth Session, November 15, at the request of George, Patriarch of Constantinople
and his Suffragans.)</p>
<p>Introductory Note.</p>
<p>(Bossuet, Defensio Cler. Gal. Lib. VII., cap. xxiv.)</p>
<p>All the fathers spoke one by one, and only after examination were the letters of St.
Agatho and the whole Western Council approved. Agatho, indeed, and the Western Bishops
put forth their decrees thus <del>‘We have directed persons from our humility to your valour
protected of God, which shall offer to you the report of us all, that is, of all the Bishops in
the Northern or Western Regions, in which too we have summed up the confession of our
Apostolic Faith, yet326</del> not as those who wished to contend about these things as being
uncertain, but, being certain and unchangeable to see them forth in a brief definition,
<del>suppliantly beseeching you that, by the favour of your sacred majesty, you would command
these same things to be preached to all, and to have force with all.’</del> Undoubtedly, therefore,
so far as in them lay, they defined the matter. The question was, whether the other Churches
throughout the world would agree, and a matter so great was only made clear after Episcopal
examination. But the high, magnificent, yet true expressions, which St. Agatho had used
of his See, namely, that resting on the promise of the Lord it had never turned aside from
the path of truth, and that its Pontiffs, the predecessors of Agatho, who were charged in the
person of Peter to strengthen their brethren, had ever discharged that office, this the Fathers
of the Council hear and receive. But not the less they examine the matter, they inquire into
the decrees of Roman Pontiffs, and, after inquiry held, approve Agatho’s decrees, condemn
those of Honorius: a certain proof that they did not understand Agatho’s expressions as if
it were necessary to receive without discussion every decree of Roman Pontiffs even de fide,
inasmuch as they are subjected to the supreme and final examination of a General Council:
but as if these expressions taken as a whole, in their total, hold good in the full and complete
succession of Peter, as we have often said, and in its proper place shall say at greater length.</p>

<head>The Letter of Pope Agatho.</head>
<p>(Found in Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. LXXXVII., col. 1161; L. and C., Tom. VI., col. 630.)
Agatho a bishop and servant of the servants of God to the most devout and serene victors
and conquerors, our most beloved sons and lovers of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Emperor Constantine the Great, and to Heraclius and Tiberius, Augustuses.</p>
<p>While contemplating the various anxieties of human life, and while groaning with
vehement weeping before the one true God, in prayer that he might impart to my wavering
soul the comfort of his divine mercy, and might lift me by his right hand out of the depths
of grief and anxiety, I most gratefully recognize, my most illustrious lords and sons, that
your purpose <del>i.e. of holding a Council</del> afforded me deep and wonderful consolation. For
it was most pious and emanated from your most meek tranquillity, taught by the divine
benignity for the benefit of the Christian commonwealth divinely entrusted to your keeping,
that your imperial power and clemency might have a care to enquire diligently concerning
the things of God (through whom Kings do reign, who is himself King of Kings and Lord
of Lords) and might seek after the truth of his spotless faith as it has been handed down by
the Apostles and by the Apostolic Fathers, and be zealously affected to command that in all
the churches the pure tradition be held. And that no one may be ignorant of this pious intention
of yours, or suspect that we have been compelled by force, and have not freely consented
to the carrying into effect of the imperial decrees touching the preaching of our
evangelical faith which was addressed to our predecessor Donus, a pontiff of Apostolic
memory, they have through our ministry been sent to and entirely approved by all nations
and peoples; for these decrees the Holy Spirit by his grace dictated to the tongue of the imperial
pen, out of the treasure of a pure heart, as the words of an adviser not of an oppressor,
defending himself, not looking with contempt upon others; not afflicting, but exhorting;
and inviting to those things which are of God in godly wise, because he, the Maker and Redeemer
of all men, who had he come in the majesty of his Godhead into the world, might
have terrified mortals, preferred to descend through his inestimable clemency and humility
to the estate of us whom he had created and thus to redeem us, who also expects from us a
willing confession of the true faith.</p>
<p>And this it is that the blessed Peter, the prince of the Apostles, teaches: “Feed the flock
of Christ which is among you, not by constraint, but willingly, exhorting it according to
God.” Therefore, encouraged by these imperial decrees, O most meek lords of all things,
and relieved from the depths of affliction and raised to the hope of consolation, I have begun,
refreshed somewhat by a better confidence, to comply with promptness with the things
which were sometime ago bidden by the Sacra of your gentlest fortitude, and am endeavouring
in obedience therewith to find persons, such as our deficient times and the quality of

<pb n="633"/>
this obedient province permit, and taking advice with my fellow-servant bishops, as well
concerning the approaching synod of this Apostolic See, as concerning our own clergy, the
lovers of the Christian Empire, and, afterwards concerning the religious servants of God,
that I might exhort them to follow in haste the footsteps of your most pious Tranquillity.
And, were it not that the great compass of the provinces, in which our humility’s council is
situated had caused so great a loss of time, our servitude a while ago could have fulfilled
with studious obedience what even now has scarcely been done. For while from the various
provinces a council has been gathering about us, and while we have been able to select some
persons of those from this very Roman city immediately subject to your most serene power,
or from those near by, others again we have been obliged to wait for from far distant
provinces, in which the word of Christian faith was preached by those sent by the predecessors
of my littleness; and thus quite a space of time has elapsed: and I pass over my
bodily pains in consequence of which life to a perpetually suffering person is neither possible
nor pleasant. Therefore, most Christian lords and sons, in accordance with the most pious
jussio of your God-protected clemency, we have had a care to send, with the devotion of a
prayerful heart (from the obedience we owe you, not because we relied on the <del>superabundant</del>
knowledge of those whom we send to you), our fellow-servants here present, Abundantius,
John, and John, our most reverend brother bishops, Theodore and George our most
beloved sons and presbyters, with our most beloved son John, a deacon, and with Constantine,
a subdeacon of this holy spiritual mother, the Apostolic See, as well as Theodore,
the presbyter legate of the holy Church of Ravenna and the religious servants of God the
monks. For, among men placed amid the Gentiles, and earning their daily bread by bodily
labour with considerable distraction, how could a knowledge of the Scriptures, in its fulness,
be found unless what has been canonically defined by our holy and apostolic predecessors,
and by the venerable five councils, we preserve in simplicity of heart, and without any distorting
keep the faith come to us from the Fathers, always desirous and endeavouring to
possess that one and chiefest good, viz.: that nothing be diminished from the things canon-
ically defined, and that nothing be changed nor added thereto, but that those same things,
both in words and sense, be guarded untouched? To these same commissioners we also
have given the witness of some of the holy Fathers, whom this Apostolic Church of Christ
receives, together with their books, so that, having obtained from the power of your most
benign Christianity the privilege of suggesting, they might out of these endeavour to give
satisfaction, (when your imperial Meekness shall have so commanded) as to what this
Apostolic Church of Christ, their spiritual mother and the mother of your God-sprung
empire, believes and preaches, not in words of worldly eloquence, which are not at the
command of ordinary men, but in the integrity of the apostolic faith, in which having been
taught from the cradle, we pray that we may serve and obey the Lord of heaven, the
Propagator of your Christian empire, even unto the end. Consequently, we have granted

<pb n="634"/>
them faculty or authority with your most tranquil mightiness, to afford satisfaction with
simplicity whenever your clemency shall command, it being enjoined on them as a limitation
that they presume not to add to, take away, or to change anything; but that they set forth
this tradition of the Apostolic See in all sincerity as it has been taught by the apostolic
pontiffs, who were our predecessors. For these delegates we most humbly implore with
bent knees of the mind your clemency ever full of condescension, that agreeably to the most
benign and most august promise of the imperial Sacra, your Christlike Tranquillity may
deem them worthy of acceptance and may deign to give a favourable hearing to their most
humble suggestions. Thus may your meekest Piety find the ears of Almighty God open to
your prayers, and may you order that they return to their own unharmed in their rectitude
of our Apostolic faith, as well as in the integrity of their bodies. And thus may the supernal
Majesty restore to the benign rule of your government through the most heroic and unconquerable
labours of your God-strengthened clemency, the whole Christian commonwealth,
and may he subdue hostile nations to your mighty sceptre, that there may be satisfaction
from this time forth to every soul and to all nations, because what you deigned to promise
solemnly by your most august letters about the immunity and safety of those who came to
the Council, you have fulfilled in all respects. It is not their wisdom that gave us confidence
to make bold to send them to your pious presence; but our littleness obediently complied
with what your imperial benignity, with a gracious order, exhorted to. And briefly we shall
intimate to your divinely instructed Piety, what the strength of our Apostolic faith contains,
which we have received through Apostolic tradition and through the tradition of the
Apostolical pontiffs, and that of the five holy general synods, through which the foundations
of Christ’s Catholic Church have been strengthened and established; this then is the status
<del>and the regular tradition327</del> of our Evangelical and Apostolic faith, to wit, that as we confess
the holy and inseparable Trinity, that is, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, to be of
one deity, of one nature and substance or essence, so we will profess also that it has one
natural will, power, operation, domination, majesty, potency, and glory. And whatever is
said of the same Holy Trinity essentially in singular number we understand to refer to the
one nature of the three consubstantial Persons, having been so taught by canonical logic.
But when we make a confession concerning one of the same three Persons of that Holy
Trinity, of the Son of God, or God the Word, and of the mystery of his adorable dispensation
according to the flesh, we assert that all things are double in the one and the same our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ according to the Evangelical tradition, that is to say, we confess
his two natures, to wit the divine and the human, of which and in which he, even after the
wonderful and inseparable union, subsists. And we confess that each of his natures has its
own natural propriety, and that the divine, has all things that are divine, without any sin.
<note type="footnote">327 Only in the Latin.</note>

<pb n="635"/>
And we recognize that each one (of the two natures) of the one and the same incarnated,
that is, humanated (humanati) Word of God is in him unconfusedly, inseparably and unchangeably,
intelligence alone discerning a unity, to avoid the error of confusion. For we
equally detest the blasphemy of division and of commixture. For when we confess two
natures and two natural wills, and two natural operations in our one Lord Jesus Christ, we
do not assert that they are contrary or opposed one to the other (as those who err from the
path of truth and accuse the apostolic tradition of doing. Far be this impiety from the hearts
of the faithful!), nor as though separated (per se separated) in two persons or subsistences,
but we say that as the same our Lord Jesus Christ has two natures so also he has two natural
wills and operations, to wit, the divine and the human: the divine will and operation he has
in common with the coessential Father from all eternity: the human, he has received from
us, taken with our nature in time. This is the apostolic and evangelic tradition, which the
spiritual mother of your most felicitous empire, the Apostolic Church of Christ, holds.</p>
<p>This is the pure expression of piety. This is the true and immaculate profession of the
Christian religion, not invented by human cunning, but which was taught by the Holy Ghost
through the princes of the Apostles. This is the firm and irreprehensible doctrine of the
holy Apostles, the integrity of the sincere piety of which, so long as it is preached freely,
defends the empire of your Tranquillity in the Christian commonwealth, and exults <del>will
defend it, will render it stable; and exulting</del>, and (as we firmly trust) will demonstrate it full
of happiness. Believe your most humble <del>servant</del>, my most Christian lords and sons, that
I am pouring forth these prayers with my tears, or its stability and exultation <del>in Greek exaltation</del>.
And these things I (although unworthy and insignificant) dare advise through my
sincere love, because your God-granted victory is our salvation, the happiness of your
Tranquillity is our joy, the harmlessness of your kindness is the security of our littleness.
And therefore I beseech you with a contrite heart and rivers of tears, with prostrated mind,
deign to stretch forth your most clement right hand to the Apostolic doctrine which the coworker
of your pious labours, the blessed apostle Peter, has delivered, that it be not hidden
under a bushel, but that it be preached in the whole earth more shrilly than a bugle: because
the true confession thereof for which Peter was pronounced blessed by the Lord of all things,
was revealed by the Father of heaven, for he received from the Redeemer of all himself, by
three commendations, the duty of feeding the spiritual sheep of the Church; under whose
protecting shield, this Apostolic Church of his has never turned away from the path of truth
in any direction of error, whose authority, as that of the Prince of all the Apostles, the whole
Catholic Church, and the Ecumenical Synods have faithfully embraced, and followed in all
things; and all the venerable Fathers have embraced its Apostolic doctrine, through which
they as the most approved luminaries of the Church of Christ have shone; and the holy orthodox
doctors have venerated and followed it, while the heretics have pursued it with false
criminations and with derogatory hatred. This is the living tradition of the Apostles of

<pb n="636"/>
Christ, which his Church holds everywhere, which is chiefly to be loved and fostered, and
is to be preached with confidence, which conciliates with God through its truthful confession,
which also renders one commendable to Christ the Lord, which keeps the Christian empire
of your Clemency, which gives far-reaching victories to your most pious Fortitude from the
Lord of heaven, which accompanies you in battle, and defeats your foes; which protects on
every side as an impregnable wall your God-sprung empire, which throws terror into opposing
nations, and smites them with the divine wrath, which also in wars celestially gives triumphal
palms over the downfall and subjection of the enemy, and ever guards your most
faithful sovereignty secure and joyful in peace. For this is the rule of the true faith, which
this spiritual mother of your most tranquil empire, the Apostolic Church of Christ, has both
in prosperity and in adversity always held and defended with energy; which, it will be proved,
by the grace of Almighty God, has never erred from the path of the apostolic tradition, nor
has she been depraved by yielding to heretical innovations, but from the beginning she has
received the Christian faith from her founders, the princes of the Apostles of Christ, and
remains undefiled unto the end, according to the divine promise of the Lord and Saviour
himself, which he uttered in the holy Gospels to the prince of his disciples: saying, “Peter,
Peter, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat; but I have
prayed for thee, that (thy) faith fail not. And when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren.” Let your tranquil Clemency therefore consider, since it is the Lord and Saviour
of all, whose faith it is, that promised that Peter’s faith should not fail and exhorted him to
strengthen his brethren, how it is known to all that the Apostolic pontiffs, the predecessors
of my littleness, have always confidently done this very thing: of whom also our littleness,
since I have received this ministry by divine designation, wishes to be the follower, although
unequal to them and the least of all. For woe is me, if I neglect to preach the truth of my
Lord, which they have sincerely preached. Woe is me, if I cover over with silence the truth
which I am bidden to give to the exchangers, i.e., to teach to the Christian people and imbue
it therewith. What shall I say in the future examination by Christ himself, if I blush (which
God forbid!) to preach here the truth of his words? What satisfaction shall I be able to give
for myself, what for the souls committed to me, when he demands a strict account of the
office I have received? Who, then, my most clement and most pious lords and sons, (I speak
trembling and prostrate in spirit) would not be stirred by that admirable promise, which is
made to the faithful: “Whoever shall confess me before men, him also will I confess before
my Father, who is in heaven”? And which one even of the infidels shall not be terrified by
that most severe threat, in which he protests that he will be full of wrath, and declares that
“Whoever shall deny me before men, him also will I deny before my Father, who is in
heaven”? Whence also blessed Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles, gives warning and says:
“But though we, or an angel from the heaven should preach to you any other Gospel from
what we have evangelized to you, let him be anathema.” Since, therefore, such an extremity

<pb n="637"/>
of punishment overhangs the corruptors, or suppressors of truth by silence, would not any
one flee from an attempt at curtailing the truth of the Lord’s faith? Wherefore the predecessors
of Apostolic memory of my littleness, learned in the doctrine of the Lord, ever since
the prelates of the Church of Constantinople have been trying to introduce into the immaculate
Church of Christ an heretical innovation, have never ceased to exhort and warn them
with many prayers, that they should, at least by silence, desist from the heretical error of
the depraved dogma, lest from this they make the beginning of a split in the unity of the
Church, by asserting one will, and one operation of the two natures in the one Jesus Christ
our Lord: a thing which the Arians and the Apollinarists, the Eutychians, the Timotheans,
the Acephali, the Theodosians and the Gaianitæ taught, and every heretical madness,
whether of those who confound, or of those who divide the mystery of the Incarnation of
Christ. Those that confound the mystery of the holy Incarnation, inasmuch as they say that
there is one nature of the deity and humanity of Christ, contend that he has one will, as of
one, and (one) personal operation. But they who divide, on the other hand, the inseparable
union, unite the two natures which they acknowledge that the Saviour possesses, not however
in an union which is recognized to be hypostatic; but blasphemously join them by concord,
through the affection of the will, like two subsistences, i.e., two somebodies. Moreover, the
Apostolic Church of Christ, the spiritual mother of your God-founded empire, confesses
one Jesus Christ our Lord existing of and in two natures, and she maintains that his two
natures, to wit, the divine and the human, exist in him unconfused even after their inseparable
union, and she acknowledges that each of these natures of Christ is perfect in the proprieties
of its nature, and she confesses that all things belonging to the proprieties of the natures are
double, because the same our Lord Jesus Christ himself is both perfect God and perfect man,
of two and in two natures: and after his wonderful Incarnation, his deity cannot be thought
of without his humanity, nor his humanity without his deity. Consequently, therefore, according
to the rule of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ, she also confesses
and preaches that there are in him two natural wills and two natural operations. For if
anybody should mean a personal will, when in the holy Trinity there are said to be three
Persons, it would be necessary that there should be asserted three personal wills, and three
personal operations (which is absurd and truly profane). Since, as the truth of the Christian
faith holds, the will is natural, where the one nature of the holy and inseparable Trinity is
spoken of, it must be consistently understood that there is one natural will, and one natural
operation. But when in truth we confess that in the one person of our Lord Jesus Christ the
mediator between God and men, there are two natures (that is to say the divine and the
human), even after his admirable union, just as we canonically confess the two natures of
one and the same person, so too we confess his two natural wills and two natural operations.
But that the understanding of this truthful confession may become clear to your Piety’s
mind from the God-inspired doctrine of the Old and the New Testament, (for your Clemency

<pb n="638"/>
is incomparably more able to penetrate the meaning of the sacred Scriptures, than our littleness
to set it forth in flowing words), our Lord Jesus Christ himself, who is true and perfect
God, and true and perfect man, in his holy Gospels shews forth in some instances human
things, in others, divine, and still in others both together, making a manifestation concerning
himself in order that he might instruct his faithful to believe and preach that he is both true
God and true man. Thus as man he prays to the Father to take away the cup of suffering,
because in him our human nature was complete, sin only excepted, “Father, if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” And in another passage:
“Not my will, but thine be done.” If we wish to know the meaning of which testimony
as explained by the holy and approved Fathers, and truly to understand what “my will,”
what “thine” signify, the blessed Ambrose in his second book to the Emperor Gratian, of
blessed memory, teaches us the meaning of this passage in these words, saying: “He then,
receives my will, he takes my sorrow, I confidently call it sorrow as I am speaking of the
cross, mine is the will, which he calls his, because he bears my sorrow as man, he spoke as
a man, and therefore he says: ‘Not as I will but as thou wilt.’” Mine is the sadness which
he has received according to my affection.328 See, most pious of princes, how clearly here
this holy Father sets forth that the words our Lord used in his prayer, “Not my will,” pertain
to his humanity; through which also he is said, according to the teaching of Blessed Paul
the Apostle of the Gentiles, to have “become obedient unto death, even the death of the
Cross.” Wherefore also it is taught us that he was obedient to his parents, which must piously
be understood to refer to his voluntary obedience, not according to his divinity (by which
he governs all things), but according to his humanity, by which he spontaneously submitted
himself to his parents. St. Luke the Evangelist likewise bears witness to the same thing,
telling how the same our Lord Jesus Christ prayed according to his humanity to his Father,
and said, “Father, if it be possible let the cup pass from me; nevertheless not my will but
thine be done,”—which passage Athanasius, the Confessor of Christ, and Archbishop of
the Church of Alexandria, in his book against Apollinaris the heretic, concerning the Trinity
and the Incarnation, also understanding the wills to be two, thus explains: And when he
says, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not my will but thine
be done,” and again, “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak;” he shews that there are
two wills, the one human which is the will of the flesh, but the other divine. For his human
will, out of the weakness of the flesh was fleeing away from the passion, but his divine will
was ready for it. What truer explanation could be found? For how is it possible not to acknowledge
in him two wills, to wit, a human and a divine, when in him, even after the inseparable
union, there are two natures according to the definitions of the synods? For John
also, who leaned upon the Lord’s breast, his beloved disciple, shews forth the same self-re-
<note type="footnote">328 Meo affectu: κατ᾽ ἐμὴν διάθεσιν.</note>

<pb n="639"/>
straint in these words: “I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of
the Father that sent me.” And again: “This is the will of him that sent me, that of all that
he gave me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.” Again he introduces
the Lord as disputing with the Jews, and saying among other things: “I seek not
mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” On the meaning of which divine words
blessed Augustine, a most illustrious doctor, thus writes in his book against Maximinus the
Arian. He says, “When the Son says to the Father ‘Not what I will, but what thou wilt,’ what
doth it profit thee, that thou broughtest thy words into subjection and sayest, It shews truly
that his will was subject to his Father, as though we would deny that the will of man should
be subject to the will of God? For that the Lord said this in his human nature, anyone will
quickly see who studies attentively this place of the Gospel. For therein he says, ‘My soul
is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.’ Can this possibly be said of the nature of the One
Word? But, O man, who thinkest to make the nature of the Holy Ghost to groan, why do
you say that the nature of the Only-begotten Word of God cannot be sad? But to prevent
anyone arguing in this way, he does not say ‘I am sad;’ (and even if he had so said, it could
properly only have been understood of his human nature) but he says ‘My soul is sad,’ which
soul he has as man; however in this also which he said, ‘Not what I will’ he shewed that he
willed something different from what the Father did, which he could not have done except
in his human nature, since he did not introduce our infirmity into his divine nature, but
would transfigure human affection. For had he not been made man, the Only Word could
in no way have said to the Father, ‘Not what I will.’ For it could never be possible for that
immutable nature to will anything different from what the Father willed. If you would but
make this distinction, O ye Arians, ye would not be heretics.”</p>
<p>In this disputation this venerable Father shews that when the Lord says “his own” he
means the will of his humanity, and when he says not to do “his own will,” he teaches us
not chiefly to seek our own wills but that through obedience we should submit our wills to
the Divine Will. From all which it is evident that he had a human will by which he obeyed
his Father, and that he had in himself this same human will immaculate from all sin, as true
God and man. Which thing St. Ambrose also thus treats of in his explanation of St. Luke
the Evangelist.</p>
<p><del>After this follows a catena of Patristic quotations which I have not thought worth while
to produce in full. After St. Ambrose he cites St. Leo, then St. Gregory Nazianzen, then St.
Augustine. (L. U+0026 C., col. 647.)</del></p>
<p>From which testimonies it is clear that each of those natures which the spiritual Doctor
has here enumerated has its own natural property, and that to each one a will ought to be
assigned. For an angelic nature cannot have a divine or a human will, neither can a human
nature have a divine or an angelic will. For no nature can have anything or any motion

<pb n="640"/>
which pertains to another nature but only that which is naturally given by creation. And
as this is the truth of the matter it is most certainly clear that we must needs confess that in
our Lord Jesus Christ there are two natures and substances, to wit, the Divine and human,
united in his one subsistence or person, and that we further confess that there are in him
two natural wills, viz.: the divine and the human, for his divinity so far as its nature is concerned
could not be said to possess a human will, nor should his humanity be believed to
have naturally a divine will: And again, neither of these two substances of Christ must be
confessed as being without a natural will; but his human will was lifted up by the omnipotency
of his divinity, and his divine will was revealed to men through his humanity. Therefore it
is necessary to refer to him as God such things as are divine, and as man such things as are
human; and each must be truly recognized through the hypostatic union of the one and the
same our Lord Jesus Christ, which the most true decree of the Council of Chalcedon sets
forth—<del>Here follows citation.</del> This same thing also the holy synod which was gathered together
in Constantinople in the time of the Emperor Justinian of august memory, teaches
in the viith. chapter of its definitions. <del>Here follows the citation.</del> Moreover it is necessary
that we should faithfully keep what those Venerable Synods taught, so that we never take
away the difference of natures as a result of the union, but confess one Christ, true and
perfect God and also true and perfect man, the propriety of each nature being kept intact.
Wherefore, if in no respect the difference of the natures of our Lord Jesus Christ has been
taken away, it is necessary that we preserve this same difference in all its proprieties. For
whoso teaches that the difference is in no respect to be taken away, declares that it must be
preserved in all things. But when the heretics and the followers of heretics say that there is
but one will and one operation, how is this difference recognized? Or where is the difference
which has been defined by this holy Synod preserved? While if it is asserted that there is
but one will in him (which is absurd), those who make this assertion must needs say that
that will is either human or divine, or else composite from both, mixed and confused, or
(according to the teaching of all heretics) that Christ has one will and one operation, proceeding
from his one composite nature (as they hold). And thus, without any doubt, the
difference of nature is destroyed, which the holy synods declared to be preserved in all respects
even after the admirable union. Because, though they taught that Christ was one, his
person and substance one, yet on account of the union of the natures which was made hypostatically,
they likewise decreed that we should clearly acknowledge and teach the difference
of those natures which were united in him, after the admirable union. Therefore if the
proprieties of the natures in the same our one Lord Jesus Christ were preserved on account
of the difference <del>of the natures</del>, it is congruous that we should with full faith confess also
the difference of his natural wills and operations, in order that we may be shown to have
followed in all respects their doctrine, and may admit into the Church of Christ no
heretical novelty.</p>

<pb n="641"/>
<p>And although there exist numerous works of the other holy Fathers, nevertheless we
subjoin to this our humble exposition a few testimonies out of the books which are in Greek,
for the sake of fastidiousness.329</p>
<p><del>Here follows a catena of passages from the Greek fathers, viz.: St. Gregory Theologus,
St. Gregory Nyssen, St. John bishop of Constantinople, St. Cyril, bishop of Alexandria. (L.
U+0026 C., col. 654.)</del></p>
<p>From these truthful testimonies it is also demonstrated that these venerable fathers
predicated in the one and the same Lord Jesus Christ two natural wills, viz.: a divine and a
human, for when St. Gregory Nazianzen says, “The willing of that man who is understood
to be the Saviour,” he shows that the human will of the Saviour was deified through its
union with the Word, and therefore it is not contrary to God. So likewise he proves that he
had a human, although deified will, and this same he had (as he teaches in what follows) as
well as his divine will, which was one and the same with that of the Father. If therefore he
had a divine and a deified will, he had also two wills. For what is divine by nature has no
need of being deified; and what is deified is not truly divine by nature. And when St. Gregory
Nyssen, a great bishop, says that the true confession of the mystery is, that there should be
understood one human will and another a divine will in Christ, what does he bid us understand
when he says one and another will, except that there are manifestly two wills?</p>
<p><del>He next proceeds to comment upon the passage cited from St. John, then upon that from
St. Cyril of Alexandria. After this follow quotations from St. Hilary, St. Athanasius, St. Denys
the Areopagite, St. Ambrose, St. Leo, St. Gregory Nyssen, St. Cyril of Alexandria, which are
next commented on in their order. He then proceeds: (L. U+0026 C., col. 662.)</del></p>
<p>There are not lacking most telling passages in other of the venerable fathers, who speak
clearly of the two natural operations in Christ, not to mention St. Cyril of Jerusalem, St.
John of Constantinople, or those who afterwards conducted the laborious conflicts in defence
of the venerable council of Chalcedon and of the Tome of St. Leo against the heretics from
whose error the assertion of this new dogma has arisen: that is to say, John, bishop of
Scythopolis, Eulogius, bishop of Alexandria, Euphræmius and Anastasius the elder, most
worthy rulers of the church of Theopolis, and above all that emulator of the true and
apostolic faith, the Emperor Justinian of pious memory, whose uprightness of faith exalted
the Christian State as much as his sincere confession pleased God. And his pious memory
<note type="footnote">329 Propter fastidium, what this may mean I have no idea; the Greek is still more extraordinary: ῥᾳθυμίας
(vel. βαρυθυμίας) χάριν.</note>

<pb n="642"/>
is esteemed worthy of veneration by all nations, whose uprightness of faith was disseminated
with praise throughout the whole world by his most august edicts: one of these, to wit, that
addressed to Zoilus, the patriarch of Alexandria, against the heresy of the Acephali to satisfy
them of the rectitude of the apostolic faith, we offer to your most tranquil Christianity,
sending it together with this paper of our lowliness through the same carriers. But lest this
declaration should be thought burdensome on account of its length, we have inserted in
this declaration of our humility only a few of the testimonies of the Holy Fathers, especially
<del>when writing to those</del> on whom the care and arrangement of the whole world as on a firm
foundation are recognized to rest; since this is altogether incomparable and great, that the
care of the whole Christian State being laid aside for a little out of love and zeal for true religion,
your august and most religious clemency should desire to understand more clearly
the doctrine of apostolical preaching. For from the different approved fathers the truth of
the Orthodox faith has become clear although the treatment is short. For the approved
fathers thought it to be superfluous to discourse at length upon what was evident and clear
to all; for who, even if he be dull of wit, does not perceive what is evident to all? For it is
impossible and contrary to the order of nature that there should be a nature without a natural
operation: and even the heretics did not dare to say this, although they were, all of
them, hunting for human craftiness and cunning questions against the orthodoxy of the
faith, and arguments agreeable to their depravities.</p>
<p>How then can that now be asserted which never was said by the holy orthodox fathers,
nor even was presumptuously invented by the profane heretics, viz.: that of the two natures
of Christ, the divine and the human, the proprieties of each of which are recognized as being
preserved in Christ, that anyone in sound mind should declare there was but one operation?
Since if there is one, let them say whether it be temporal or eternal, divine or human, uncreated
or created: the same as that of the Father or different from that of the Father. If
therefore it is one, that one and the same must be common to the divinity and to the humanity
(which is absurd), therefore while the Son of God, who is both God and man, wrought
human things on earth, likewise also the Father worked with him according to his nature
(naturaliter, φυσικῶς); for what things the Father doeth these the Son also doeth likewise.
But if (as is the truth) the human acts which Christ did are to be referred to his person alone
as the Son, which is not the same as that of the Father; in one nature Christ worked one set
of works, and in the other another, so that according to his divinity the Son does the same
things that the Father does; and likewise according to his humanity, what things are proper
to the manhood, those same, he as man, did because he is truly both God and man. For
which reason we rightly believe that that same person, since he is one, has two natural operations,
to wit, the divine and the human, one uncreated, and the other created, as true and
perfect God and as true and perfect man, the one and the same, the mediator between God
and men, the Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore from the quality of the operations there is re-

<pb n="643"/>
cognized a difference void of offence (ἀπρόσκοπος ) of the natures which are joined in Christ
through the hypostatic union. We now proceed to cite some passages from the execrable
writings of the heretics hated of God,330 whose words and sayings we equally abominate,
for the demonstration of those things which our inventors of new dogma have followed
teaching that in Christ there is but one will and one operation.</p>
<p><del>Then follow quotations from Apollinaris, Severus, Theodosius of Alexandria. (L. U+0026 C.,
col. 667.)</del></p>
<p>Behold, most pious lords and sons, by the testimonies of the holy Fathers, as by spiritual
rays, the doctrine of the Catholic and Apostolic Church has been illustrated and the darkness
of heretical blindness, which is offering error to men for imitation, has been revealed. Now
it is necessary that the new doctrine should follow somebody, and by whose authority it is
supported, we shall note.</p>
<p><del>Here follow quotations from Cyrus of Alexandria, Theodore of Pharon, Sergius of
Constantinople, Pyrrhus, Paulus his successor, Peter his successor. (L. U+0026 C., col. 670.)</del></p>
<p>Let then your God-founded clemency with the internal eye of discrimination, which
for the guidance of the Christian people you have been deemed worthy to receive by the
Grace of God, take heed which one of such doctors you think the Christian people should
follow, the doctrine of which one of these they should embrace so as to be saved; for they
condemn all, and each one of them the other, according as the various and unstable definitions
in their writings assert sometimes that there is one will and one operation, sometimes
that there is neither one nor two operations, sometimes one will and operation, and again
two wills and two operations, likewise one will and one operation, and again neither one,
nor two, and somebody else one and two.</p>
<p>Who does not hate, and rage against, and avoid such blind errors, if he have any desire
to be saved and seek to offer to the Lord at his coming a right faith? Therefore the Holy
Church of God, the mother of your most Christian power, should be delivered and liberated
with all your might (through the help of God) from the errors of such teachers, and the
evangelical and apostolic uprightness of the orthodox faith, which has been established upon
the firm rock of this Church of blessed Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, which by his grace
and guardianship remains free from all error, <del>that faith I say</del> the whole number of rulers
and priests, of the clergy and of the people, unanimously should confess and preach with
us as the true declaration of the Apostolic tradition, in order to please God and to save their
own souls.</p>
<note type="footnote">330 The meaning of this passage is clear enough but the text is slightly corrupt.</note>

<pb n="644"/>
<p>And these things we have taken pains to insert in the tractate of our humility, for we
have been afflicted and have groaned without ceasing that such grievous errors should be
entertained by bishops of the Church, who are zealous to establish their own peculiar views
rather than the truth of the faith, and think that our sincere fraternal admonition has its
spring in a contempt for them. And indeed the apostolic predecessors of my humility admonished,
begged, upbraided, besought, reproved, and exercised every kind of exhortation
that the recent wound might receive a remedy, moved thereto not by a mind filled with
hatred (God is my witness) nor through the elation of boasting, nor through the opposition
of contention, nor through an inane desire to find some fault with their teachings, nor
through anything akin to the love of arrogance, but out of zeal for the uprightness of the
truth, and for the rule of the confession of the pure Gospel, and for the salvation of souls,
and for the stability of the Christian state, and for the safety of those who rule the Roman
Empire. Nor did they cease from their admonitions after the long duration of this domesticated
error, but always exhorted and bore record, and that with fraternal charity, not through
malice or pertinacious hatred (far be it from the Christian heart to rejoice at another’s fall,
when the Lord of all teaches, “I desire not the death of a sinner, but that he be converted
and live;” and who rejoiceth over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety-and-nine
just persons: who came down from heaven to earth to deliver the lost sheep, inclining the
power of his majesty), but desiring them with outstretched spiritual arms, and exhorting to
embrace them returning to the unity of the orthodox faith, and awaiting their conversion
to the full rectitude of the orthodox faith: that they might not make themselves aliens from
our communion, that is from the communion of blessed Peter the Apostle, whose ministry,
we (though unworthy) exercise, and preach the faith he has handed down, but that they
should together with us pray Christ the Lord, the spotless sacrifice, for the stability of your
most strong and serene Empire.</p>
<p>We believe, most pious lords <del>singular in the Latin</del> of all things, that there has been left
no possible ambiguity which can prevent the recognizing of those who have followed the
inventors of new dogma. For the sweetness of spiritual understanding with which the sayings
of the Fathers are full has become evident to the eyes of all; and the stench of the heretics,
to be avoided by all the faithful, has been made notorious. Nor has it remained unknown
that the inventors of new dogma have been shewn to be the followers of heretics, and not
the walkers in the footsteps of the holy Fathers: therefore whoever wishes to colour any
error of his whatever, is condemned by the light of truth, as the Apostle of the Gentiles says,
“For everything that doth make manifest is light,” for the truth ever remains constant and
the same, but falsehood is ever varying, and in its wanderings adopting things mutually
contradictory. On this account the inventors of the new dogma have been shewn to have
taught things mutually contradictory, because they were not willing to be followers of the
Evangelical and Apostolic faith. Wherefore since the truth has shone forth by the observa-

<pb n="645"/>
tions of your God-inspired piety, and falsity which has been exposed has attained the contempt
which it deserved, it remains that the crowned truth may shine forth victoriously
through the pious favours of your God-crowned clemency; and that the error of novelty
with its inventors and with those who follow their doctrine, may receive the punishment
due their presumption, and be cast forth from the midst of the orthodox prelates for the
heretical pravity of their innovation, which into the holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church
of Christ they have endeavoured to introduce, and to stain with the contagion of heretical
pravity the indivisible and unspotted body of the Church <del>of Christ</del>. For it is not just that
the injurious should injure the innocent, nor that the offences of some should be visited
upon the inoffensive, for even if in this world to the condemned mercy is extended, yet they
who are thus spared reap for that sparing no benefit in the judgment of God, and by those
thus sparing them there is incurred no little danger for their unlawful compassion.</p>
<p>But we believe that Almighty God has reserved for the happy days of your gentleness
the amending of these things, that filling on earth the place and zeal of our Lord Jesus Christ
himself, who has vouchsafed to crown your rule, ye may judge just judgment for his Evangelical
and Apostolical truth: for although he be the Redeemer and Saviour of the human
race yet he suffered injury, and bore it even until now, and inspired the empire of your
fortitude, so that you should be worthy to follow the cause of his faith (as equity demanded,
and as the determination of the Holy Fathers and of the Five General Synods decreed), and
that you should avenge, through his guardianship, on the spurners of his faith, the injury
done your Redeemer and Colleague in reigning, thus fulfilling magnanimously with imperial
clemency that prophetic utterance with which David the King and Prophet, spake to
God, saying, “The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.” Wherefore having been extolled
for so God-pleasing a zeal, he was deemed fit to hear that blessed word spoken by the Creator
of all men, “I have found David, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.” And
to him also it was promised in the Psalms, “I have found David, my servant, with my holy
oil have I anointed him: My hand shall aid him and my arm shall comfort him,” so that the
most pious majesty of your Christian clemency may work to further the cause of Christ with
burning zeal for the sake of remuneration, and may he make all the acts of your most
powerful empire both happy and prosperous, who hath stored up his promise in the Holy
Gospels, saying, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto
you.” For all, to whom has come the knowledge of the sacred heads,331 have been offering
innumerable thanksgivings and unceasing praises to the defender of your most powerful
dominion, being filled with admiration for the greatness of your clemency, in that you have
so benignly set forth the kind intention of your august magnanimity; for in truth, as most
<note type="footnote">331 I.e., the imperial edicts.</note>

<pb n="646"/>
pious and most just princes, you have deigned to treat divine things with the fear of God,
having promised every immunity to those persons sent to you from our littleness.</p>
<p>And we are confident that what your pious clemency has promised, you are powerful
to carry out, in order that what has been vowed and promised to God by the religious philanthropy
beyond your Christian power, may nevertheless be fulfilled by the aid of his omnipotency.</p>
<p>Wherefore let praise by all Christian nations, and eternal memory, and frequent prayer
be poured forth before the Lord Christ, whose is the cause, for your safety, and your triumphs,
and your complete victory, that the nations of the Gentiles, being impressed by the terror
of the supernal majesty, may lay down most humbly their necks beneath the sceptre of your
most powerful rule, that the power of your most pious kingdom may continue until the
ceaseless joy of the eternal kingdom succeeds to this temporal reign. Nor could anything
be found more likely to commend the clemency of your unconquerable fortitude to the divine
majesty, than that those who err from the rule of truth should be repelled and the integrity
of our Evangelical and Apostolic faith should be everywhere set forth and preached.</p>
<p>Moreover, most pious and God-instructed sons and lords, if the Archbishop of the
Church of Constantinople shall choose to hold and to preach with us this most unblameable
rule of Apostolic doctrine of the Sacred Scriptures, of the venerable synods, of the spiritual
Fathers, according to their evangelical understanding, through which the form of the truth
has been set forth by us through the assistance of the Spirit, there will ensue great peace to
them that love the name of God, and there will remain no scandal of dissension, and that
will come to pass which is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, when through the grace of
the Holy Spirit the people had come to the acknowledging of Christianity, all of us will be
of one heart and of one mind. But if (which God forbid!) he shall prefer to embrace the
novelty but lately introduced by others; and shall ensnare himself with doctrines which are
alien to the rule of orthodox truth and of our Apostolic faith, to decline which as injurious
to souls these have put off, despite the exhortation and admonitions of our predecessors in
the Apostolic See, down to this day, he himself should know what kind of an answer he will
have to give for such contempt in the divine examination of Christ before the judge of all,
who is in heaven, to whom when he cometh to judgment also we ourselves are about to give
an account of the ministry of preaching the truth which has been committed to us, or for
the toleration of things contrary to the Christian religion: and may we (as I humbly pray)
preserve unconfusedly and freely, with simplicity and purity, whole and undefiled, the
Apostolic and Evangelical rule of the right faith as we have received it from the beginning.
And may your most august serenity, for the affection and reverence which you bear to the
Catholic and Apostolic right faith, receive the perfect reward of your pious labours from
our Lord Jesus Christ himself, the ruler with you of your Christian empire, whose true
confession you desire to preserve undefiled, because nothing in any respect has been neglected

<pb n="647"/>
or omitted by your God-crowned clemency, which could minister to the peace of the
churches, provided always that the integrity of the true faith was maintained: since God,
the Judge of all, who disposes the ending of all matters as he deems most expedient, seeks
out the intent of the heart, and will accept a zeal for piety. Therefore I exhort you, O most
pious and clement Emperor, and together with my littleness every Christian man exhorts
you on bended knee with all humility, that to all the God-pleasing goodnesses and admirable
imperial benefits which the heavenly condescension has vouchsafed to grant to the human
race through your God-accepted care, this also you would order, for the redintegration of
perfect piety, to offer an acceptable sacrifice to Christ the Lord your fellow-ruler, granting
entire impunity, and free faculty of speech to each one wishing to speak, and to urge a word
in defence of the faith which he believes and holds, so that it may most manifestly be recognized
by all that by no terror, by no force, by no threat or aversion any one wishing to speak
for the truth of the Catholic and Apostolic faith, has been prohibited or repulsed, and that
all unanimously may glorify your imperial (divinam) majesty, throughout the whole space
of their lives for so great and so inestimable a good, and may pour forth unceasing prayers
to Christ the Lord that your most strong empire may be preserved untouched and exalted.
The Subscription. May the grace from above keep your empire, most pious lords, and place
beneath its feet the neck of all the nations.</p>

<head>The Letter of Agatho and of the Roman Synod of 125 Bishops which
was to Serve as an Instruction to the Legates Sent to Attend the Sixth
Synod.</head>
<p>(Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 677 et seqq., and in Migne, Pat.
Lat. Tom. LXXXVII., col. 1215 et seqq. <del>This last text, which is Mansi’s, I have followed</del>.)</p>
<p>To the most pious Lords and most serene victors and conquerors, our own sons beloved
of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, Constantine, the great Emperor, and Heraclius and
Tiberius, Augustuses, Agatho, the bishop and servant of the servants of God, together with
all the synods subject to the council of the Apostolic See.</p>
<p><del>The Letter opens with a number of compliments to the Emperor, much in style and
matter like the introduction of the preceding letter. I have not thought it worth while to
translate this, but have begun at the doctrinal part, which is given to the reader in full. (Labbe
and Cossart, col. 682.)</del></p>
<p>We believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things
visible and invisible; and in his only-begotten Son, who was begotten of him before all
worlds; very God of Very God, Light of Light, begotten not made, being of one substance
with the Father, that is of the same substance as the Father; by him were all things made
which are in heaven and which are in earth; and in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of
life, who proceedeth from the Father, and with the Father and the Son together is worshipped
and glorified; the Trinity in unity and Unity in trinity; a unity so far as essence is concerned,
but a trinity of persons or subsistences; and so we confess God the Father, God the Son, and
God the Holy Ghost; not three gods, but one God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost:
not a subsistency of three names, but one substance of three subsistences; and of these persons
one is the essence, or substance or nature, that is to say one is the godhead, one the eternity,
one the power, one the kingdom, one the glory, one the adoration, one the essential will
and operation of the same Holy and inseparable Trinity, which hath created all things, hath
made disposition of them, and still contains them.</p>
<p>Moreover we confess that one of the same holy consubstantial Trinity, God the Word,
who was begotten of the Father before the worlds, in the last days of the world for us and
for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Ghost, and of our
Lady, the holy, immaculate, ever-virgin and glorious Mary, truly and properly the Mother
of God, that is to say according to the flesh which was born of her; and was truly made man,
the same being very God and very man. God of God his Father, but man of his Virgin
Mother, incarnate of her flesh with a reasonable and intelligent soul: of one substance with
God the Father, as touching his godhead, and consubstantial with us as touching his man-

<pb n="649"/>
hood, and in all points like unto us, but without sin. He was crucified for us under Pontius
Pilate, he suffered, was buried and rose again; ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right
hand of the Father, and he shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead, and of
his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>
<p>And this same one Lord of ours, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, we acknowledge
to subsist of and in two substances unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably,
the difference of the natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the
proprieties of each nature being preserved and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence,
not scattered or divided into two Persons, nor confused into one composite nature; but we
confess one and the same only-begotten Son, God the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, not one
in another, nor one added to another, but himself the same in two natures—that is to say
in the Godhead and in the manhood even after the hypostatic union: for neither was the
Word changed into the nature of flesh, nor was the flesh transformed into the nature of the
Word, for each remained what it was by nature. We discern by contemplation alone the
distinction between the natures united in him of which inconfusedly, inseparably and unchangeably
he is composed; for one is of both, and through one both, because there are together
both the height of the deity and the humility of the flesh, each nature preserving after
the union its own proper character without any defect; and each form acting in communion
with the other what is proper to itself. The Word working what is proper to the Word, and
the flesh what is proper to the flesh; of which the one shines with miracles, the other bows
down beneath injuries. Wherefore, as we confess that he truly has two natures or substances,
viz.: the Godhead and the manhood, inconfusedly, indivisibly and unchangeably <del>united</del>,
so also the rule of piety instructs us that he has two natural wills and two natural operations,
as perfect God and perfect man, one and the same our Lord Jesus Christ. And this the
apostolic and evangelical tradition and the authority of the Holy Fathers (whom the Holy
Apostolic and Catholic Church and the venerable Synods receive), has plainly taught us.</p>
<p><del>The letter goes on to say that this is the traditional faith, and is that which was set forth
in a council over which Pope Martin presided, and that those opposed to this faith have erred
from the truth, some in one way, and some in another. It next apologizes for the delay in
sending the persons ordered by the imperial Sacra, and proceeds thus: (Labbe and Cossart,
col. 686; Migne, col. 1224).</del></p>
<p>In the first place, a great number of us are spread over a vast extent of country even to
the sea coast, and the length of their journey necessarily took much time. Moreover we
were in hopes of being able to join to our humility our fellow-servant and brother bishop,
Theodore, the archbishop and philosopher of the island of Great Britain, with others who
have been kept there even till to-day; and to add to these divers bishops of this council who
have their sees in different parts, that our humble suggestion <del>i.e., the doctrinal definition</del>

<pb n="650"/>
<del>contained in the letters</del> might proceed from a council of wide-spread influence, lest if only
a part were cognizant of what was being done, it might escape the notice of a part; and especially
because among the Gentiles, as the Longobards, and the Sclavi, as also the Franks, the
French, the Goths, and the Britains, there are known to be very many of our fellow-servants
who do not cease curiously to enquire on the subject, that they may know what is being
done in the cause of the Apostolic faith: who as they can be of advantage so long as they
hold the true faith with us, and think in unison with us, so are they found troublesome and
contrary, if (which may God forbid!) they stumble at any article of the faith. But we, although
most humble, yet strive with all our might that the commonwealth of your Christian empire
may be shown to be more sublime than all the nations, for in it has been founded the See
of Blessed Peter, the prince of the Apostles, by the authority of which, all Christian nations
venerate and worship with us, through the reverence of the blessed Apostle Peter himself.
(This is the Latin, which appears to me to be corrupt, the Greek reads as follows: “The authority
of which for the truth, all the Christian nations together with us worship and revere, according
to the honour of the blessed Peter the Apostle himself.”)</p>

<p>(L. and C., Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 943.)</p>
<p>The holy council said: After we had reconsidered, according to our promise which we
had made to your highness, the doctrinal letters of Sergius, at one time patriarch of this
royal god-protected city to Cyrus, who was then bishop of Phasis and to Honorius some
time Pope of Old Rome, as well as the letter of the latter to the same Sergius, we find that
these documents are quite foreign to the apostolic dogmas, to the declarations of the holy
Councils, and to all the accepted Fathers, and that they follow the false teachings of the
heretics; therefore we entirely reject them, and execrate them as hurtful to the soul. But the
names of those men whose doctrines we execrate must also be thrust forth from the holy
Church of God, namely, that of Sergius some time bishop of this God-preserved royal city
who was the first to write on this impious doctrine; also that of Cyrus of Alexandria, of
Pyrrhus, Paul, and Peter, who died bishops of this God-preserved city, and were like-minded
with them; and that of Theodore sometime bishop of Pharan, all of whom the most holy
and thrice blessed Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, in his suggestion to our most pious and Godpreserved
lord and mighty Emperor, rejected, because they were minded contrary to our
orthodox faith, all of whom we define are to be subjected to anathema. And with these we
define that there shall be expelled from the holy Church of God and anathematized Honorius
who was some time Pope of Old Rome, because of what we found written by him to Sergius,
that in all respects he followed his view and confirmed his impious doctrines. We have also
examined the synodal letter of Sophronius of holy memory, some time Patriarch of the Holy
City of Christ our God, Jerusalem, and have found it in accordance with the true faith and
with the Apostolic teachings, and with those of the holy approved Fathers. Therefore we
have received it as orthodox and as salutary to the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and
have decreed that it is right that his name be inserted in the diptychs of the Holy Churches.</p>

<head>The Definition of Faith.</head>
<p>(Found in the Acts, Session XVIII., L. and C., Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 1019.)
The holy, great, and Ecumenical Synod which has been assembled by the grace of God,
and the religious decree of the most religious and faithful and mighty Sovereign Constantine,
in this God-protected and royal city of Constantinople, New Rome, in the Hall of the imperial
Palace, called Trullus, has decreed as follows.</p>
<p>The only-begotten Son, and Word of God the Father, who was made man in all things
like unto us without sin, Christ our true God, has declared expressly in the words of the
Gospel, “I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but
shall have the light of life.” And again, “My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
you.” Our most gentle Sovereign, the champion of orthodoxy, and opponent of evil doctrine,
being reverentially led by this divinely uttered doctrine of peace, and having convened this
our holy and Ecumenical assembly, has united the judgment of the whole Church. Wherefore
this our holy and Ecumenical Synod having driven away the impious error which had prevailed
for a certain time until now, and following closely the straight path of the holy and
approved Fathers, has piously given its full assent to the five holy and Ecumenical Synods
(that is to say, to that of the 318 holy Fathers who assembled in Nice against the raging
Arius; and the next in Constantinople of the 150 God-inspired men against Macedonius
the adversary of the Spirit, and the impious Apollinaris; and also the first in Ephesus of 200
venerable men convened against Nestorius the Judaizer; and that in Chalcedon of 630 Godinspired
Fathers against Eutyches and Dioscorus hated of God; and in addition to these, to
the last, that is the Fifth holy Synod assembled in this place, against Theodore of Mopsuestia,
Origen, Didymus, and Evagrius, and the writings of Theodoret against the Twelve Chapters
of the celebrated Cyril, and the Epistle which was said to be written by Ibas to Maris the
Persian), renewing in all things the ancient decrees of religion, and chasing away the impious
doctrines of irreligion. And this our holy and Ecumenical Synod inspired of God has set
its seal to the Creed which was put forth by the 318 Fathers, and again religiously confirmed
by the 150, which also the other holy synods cordially received and ratified for the taking
away of every soul-destroying heresy.</p>
<p>The Nicene Creed of the 318 holy Fathers.</p>
<p>We believe, etc.</p>
<p>The Creed of the 150 holy Fathers assembled at Constantinople. We believe, etc.</p>
<p>The holy and Ecumenical Synod further says, this pious and orthodox Creed of the Divine
grace would be sufficient for the full knowledge and confirmation of the orthodox faith.
But as the author of evil, who, in the beginning, availed himself of the aid of the serpent,
and by it brought the poison of death upon the human race, has not desisted, but in like
manner now, having found suitable instruments for working out his will (we mean

<pb n="656"/>
Theodorus, who was Bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were Archbishops
of this royal city, and moreover, Honorius who was Pope of the elder Rome, Cyrus
Bishop of Alexandria, Macarius who was lately bishop of Antioch, and Stephen his disciple),
has actively employed them in raising up for the whole Church the stumbling-blocks of one
will and one operation in the two natures of Christ our true God, one of the Holy Trinity;
thus disseminating, in novel terms, amongst the orthodox people, an heresy similar to the
mad and wicked doctrine of the impious Apollinaris, Severus, and Themistius, and endeavouring
craftily to destroy the perfection of the incarnation of the same our Lord Jesus Christ,
our God, by blasphemously representing his flesh endowed with a rational soul as devoid
of will or operation. Christ, therefore, our God, has raised up our faithful Sovereign, a new
David, having found him a man after his own heart, who as it is written, “has not suffered
his eyes to sleep nor his eyelids to slumber,” until he has found a perfect declaration of or-
thodoxy by this our God-collected and holy Synod; for, according to the sentence spoken
of God, “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of
them,” the present holy and Ecumenical Synod faithfully receiving and saluting with uplifted
hands as well the suggestion which by the most holy and blessed Agatho, Pope of ancient
Rome, was sent to our most pious and faithful Emperor Constantine, which rejected by
name those who taught or preached one will and one operation in the dispensation of the
incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ who is our very God, has likewise adopted that other
synodal suggestion which was sent by the Council holden under the same most holy Pope,
composed of 125 Bishops, beloved of God, to his God-instructed tranquillity, as consonant
to the holy Council of Chalcedon and to the Tome of the most holy and blessed Leo, Pope
of the same old Rome, which was directed to St. Flavian, which also this Council called the
Pillar of the right faith; and also agrees with the Synodal Epistles which were written by
Blessed Cyril against the impious Nestorius and addressed to the Oriental Bishops. Following
the five holy Ecumenical Councils and the holy and approved Fathers, with one voice defining
that our Lord Jesus Christ must be confessed to be very God and very man, one of the holy
and consubstantial and life-giving Trinity, perfect in Deity and perfect in humanity, very
God and very man, of a reasonable soul and human body subsisting; consubstantial with
the Father as touching his Godhead and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood;
in all things like unto us, sin only excepted; begotten of his Father before all ages according
to his Godhead, but in these last days for us men and for our salvation made man of the
Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, strictly and properly the Mother of God according to
the flesh; one and the same Christ our Lord the only-begotten Son of two natures unconfusedly,
unchangeably, inseparably indivisibly to be recognized, the peculiarities of neither
nature being lost by the union but rather the proprieties of each nature being preserved,
concurring in one Person and in one subsistence, not parted or divided into two persons
but one and the same only-begotten Son of God, the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, according

<pb n="657"/>
as the Prophets of old have taught us and as our Lord Jesus Christ himself hath instructed
us, and the Creed of the holy Fathers hath delivered to us; defining all this we likewise declare
that in him are two natural wills and two natural operations indivisibly, inconvertibly, inseparably,
inconfusedly, according to the teaching of the holy Fathers. And these two natural
wills are not contrary the one to the other (God forbid!) as the impious heretics assert,
but his human will follows and that not as resisting and reluctant, but rather as subject to
his divine and omnipotent will. For it was right that the flesh should be moved but subject
to the divine will, according to the most wise Athanasius. For as his flesh is called and is
the flesh of God the Word, so also the natural will of his flesh is called and is the proper will
of God the Word, as he himself says: “I came down from heaven, not that I might do mine
own will but the will of the Father which sent me!” where he calls his own will the will of
his flesh, inasmuch as his flesh was also his own. For as his most holy and immaculate animated
flesh was not destroyed because it was deified but continued in its own state and
nature (ὄρῳ τε καὶ λόγῳ), so also his human will, although deified, was not suppressed, but
was rather preserved according to the saying of Gregory Theologus: “His will <del>i.e., the Saviour’s</del>
is not contrary to God but altogether deified.”</p>
<p>We glorify two natural operations indivisibly, immutably, inconfusedly, inseparably in
the same our Lord Jesus Christ our true God, that is to say a divine operation and a human
operation, according to the divine preacher Leo, who most distinctly asserts as follows: “For
each form (μορφὴ) does in communion with the other what pertains properly to it, the
Word, namely, doing that which pertains to the Word, and the flesh that which pertains to
the flesh.”</p>
<p>For we will not admit one natural operation in God and in the creature, as we will not
exalt into the divine essence what is created, nor will we bring down the glory of the divine
nature to the place suited to the creature.</p>
<p>We recognize the miracles and the sufferings as of one and the same <del>Person</del>, but of
one or of the other nature of which he is and in which he exists, as Cyril admirably says.
Preserving therefore the inconfusedness and indivisibility, we make briefly this whole confession,
believing our Lord Jesus Christ to be one of the Trinity and after the incarnation
our true God, we say that his two natures shone forth in his one subsistence in which he
both performed the miracles and endured the sufferings through the whole of his economic
conversation (δἰ ὅλης αὐτοῦ τῆς οἰκονομκῆς ἀναστροφῆς), and that not in appearance only
but in very deed, and this by reason of the difference of nature which must be recognized
in the same Person, for although joined together yet each nature wills and does the things
proper to it and that indivisibly and inconfusedly. Wherefore we confess two wills and two
operations, concurring most fitly in him for the salvation of the human race.</p>
<p>These things, therefore, with all diligence and care having been formulated by us, we
define that it be permitted to no one to bring forward, or to write, or to compose, or to think,

<pb n="658"/>
or to teach a different faith. Whosoever shall presume to compose a different faith, or to
propose, or teach, or hand to those wishing to be converted to the knowledge of the truth,
from the Gentiles or Jews, or from any heresy, any different Creed; or to introduce a new
voice or invention of speech to subvert these things which now have been determined by
us, all these, if they be Bishops or clerics let them be deposed, the Bishops from the Episcopate,
the clerics from the clergy; but if they be monks or laymen: let them be anathematized.</p>

<p><del>This address begins with many compliments to the Emperor, especially for his zeal for
the true faith.</del></p>
<p>But because the adversary Satan allows no rest, he has raised up the very ministers of
Christ against him, as if armed and carrying weapons, etc.</p>
<p><del>The various heretics are then named and how they were condemned by the preceding
five councils is set forth.</del></p>
<p>Things being so, it was necessary that your beloved of Christ majesty should gather together
this all holy, and numerous assembly.</p>
<gap reason="omitted"/>
<p>Thereafter being inspired by the Holy Ghost, and all agreeing and consenting together,
and giving our approval to the doctrinal letter of our most blessed and exalted pope, Agatho,
which he sent to your mightiness, as also agreeing to the suggestion of the holy synod of
one hundred and twenty-five fathers held under him, we teach that one of the Holy Trinity,
our Lord Jesus Christ, was incarnate, and must be celebrated in two perfect natures without
division and without confusion. For as the Word, he is consubstantial and eternal with God
his father; but as taking flesh of the immaculate Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, he is perfect
man, consubstantial with us and made in time. We declare therefore that he is perfect in
Godhead and that the same is perfect likewise in manhood, according to the pristine tradition
of the fathers and the divine definition of Chalcedon.</p>
<p>And as we recognize two natures, so also we recognize two natural wills and two natural
operations. For we dare not say that either of the natures which are in Christ in his incarnation
is without a will and operation: lest in taking away the proprieties of those natures,
we likewise take away the natures of which they are the proprieties. For we neither deny
the natural will of his humanity, or its natural operation: lest we also deny what is the chief
thing of the dispensation for our salvation, and lest we attribute passions to the Godhead.
For this they were attempting who have recently introduced the detestable novelty that in
him there is but one will and one operation, renewing the malignancy of Arius, Apollinaris,
Eutyches and Severus. For should we say that the human nature of our Lord is without will
and operation, how could we affirm in safety the perfect humanity? For nothing else constitutes
the integrity of human nature except the essential will, through which the strength
of free-will is marked in us; and this is also the case with the substantial operation. For how
shall we call him perfect in humanity if he in no wise suffered and acted as a man? For like

<pb n="660"/>
as the union of two natures preserves for us one subsistence without confusion and without
division; so this one subsistence, shewing itself in two natures, demonstrates as its own what
things belong to each.</p>
<p>Therefore we declare that in him there are two natural wills and two natural operations,
proceeding commonly and without division: but we cast out of the Church and rightly
subject to anathema all superfluous novelties as well as their inventors: to wit, Theodore of
Pharan, Sergius and Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter (who were archbishops of Constantinople),
moreover Cyrus, who bore the priesthood of Alexandria, and with them Honorius, who
was the ruler (πρόεδρον) of Rome, as he followed them in these things. Besides these, with
the best of cause we anathematize and depose Macarius, who was bishop of Antioch, and
his disciple Stephen (or rather we should say master), who tried to defend the impiety of
their predecessors, and in short stirred up the whole world, and by their pestilential letters
and by their fraudulent institutions devastated multitudes in every direction. Likewise also
that old man Polychronius, with an infantile intelligence, who promised he would raise the
dead and who when they did not rise, was laughed at; and all who have taught, or do teach,
or shall presume to teach one will and one operation in the incarnate Christ.<gap reason="omitted"/>But the
highest prince of the Apostles fought with us: for we had on our side his imitator and the
successor in his see, who also had set forth in his letter the mystery of the divine word
(θεολογίας). For the ancient city of Rome handed thee a confession of divine character,
and a chart from the sunsetting raised up the day of dogmas, and made the darkness manifest,
and Peter spoke through Agatho, and thou, O autocratic King, according to the divine decree,
with the Omnipotent Sharer of thy throne, didst judge.</p>
<gap reason="omitted"/>
<p>But, O benign and justice-loving Lord, do thou in return do this favour to him who
hath bestowed thy power upon thee; and give, as a seal to what has been defined by us, thy
imperial ratification in writing, and so confirm them with the customary pious edicts and
constitutions, that no one may contradict the things which have been done, nor raise any
fresh question. For rest assured, O serene majesty, that we have not falsified anything defined
by the Ecumenical Councils and by the approved fathers, but we have confirmed them.
And now we all cry out with one mind and one voice, “O God, save the King! etc., etc.”</p>

<p>(Found in Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. LXXXVII., col. 1247 et seqq.; and Labbe and Cossart, Concilia,
Tom. VI., col. 1071 et seqq.)</p>
<p>A copy of the letter sent by the holy and Ecumenical Sixth Council to Agatho, the most
blessed and most holy pope of Old Rome.</p>
<p>The holy and ecumenical council which by the grace of God and the pious sanction of
the most pious and faithful Constantine, the great Emperor, has been gathered together in
this God-preserved and royal city, Constantinople, the new Rome, in the Secretum of the
imperial (θείου, sacri) palace called Trullus, to the most holy and most blessed pope of Old
Rome, Agatho, health in the Lord.</p>
<p>Serious illnesses call for greater helps, as you know, most blessed <del>father</del>; and therefore
Christ our true God, who is the creator and governing power of all things, gave a wise
physician, namely your God-honoured sanctity, to drive away by force the contagion of
heretical pestilence by the remedies of orthodoxy, and to give the strength of health to the
members of the church. Therefore to thee, as to the bishop of the first see of the Universal
Church, we leave what must be done, since you willingly take for your standing ground the
firm rock of the faith, as we know from having read your true confession in the letter sent
by your fatherly beatitude to the most pious emperor: and we acknowledge that this letter
was divinely written (perscriptas) as by the Chief of the Apostles, and through it we have
cast out the heretical sect of many errors which had recently sprung up, having been urged
to making a decree by Constantine who divinely reigns, and wields a most clement sceptre.
And by his help we have overthrown the error of impiety, having as it were laid siege to the
nefarious doctrine of the heretics. And then tearing to pieces the foundations of their execrable
heresy, and attacking them with spiritual and paternal arms, and confounding their
tongues that they might not speak consistently with each other, we overturned the tower
built up by these followers of this most impious heresy; and we slew them with anathema,
as lapsed concerning the faith and as sinners, in the morning outside the camp of the tabernacle
of God, that we may express ourselves after the manner of David,334 in accordance
with the sentence already given concerning them in your letter, and their names are these:
Theodore, bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, Paul, Pyrrhus and Peter. Moreover,
in addition to these, we justly subjected to the anathema of heretics those also who live in
their impiety which they have received, or, to speak more accurately, in the impiety of these
God-hated persons, Apollinaris, Severus and Themestius, to wit, Macarius, who was the
bishop of the great city of Antioch (and him we also stripped deservedly of his pastor’s robes
<note type="footnote">334 Psalm C., verse 8 (Heb. ci., ult.) neither LXX. nor Vulgate version.</note>

<pb n="662"/>
on account of his impenitence concerning the orthodox faith and his obstinate stubbornness),
and Stephen, his disciple in craziness and his teacher in impiety, also Polychronius, who
was inveterate in his heretical doctrines, thus answering to his name; and finally all those
who impenitently have taught or do teach, or now hold or have held similar doctrines.</p>
<p>Up to now grief, sorrow, and many tears have been our portion. For we cannot laugh
at the fall of our neighbours, nor exult with joy at their unbridled madness, nor have we
been elated that we might fall all the more grievously because of this thing; not thus, O
venerable and sacred head, have we been taught, we who hold Christ, the Lord of the universe,
to be both benign and man-loving in the highest degree; for he exhorts us to be imitators
of him in his priesthood so far as is possible, as becometh the good, and to obtain the pattern
of his pastoral and conciliatory government. But also to true repentance the most Serene
Emperor and ourselves have exhorted them in various ways, and we have conducted the
whole matter with great religiousness and care. Nor have we been moved to do so for the
sake of gain, nor by hatred, as you can easily see from what things have been done in each
session, and related in the minutes, which are herewith sent to your blessedness: and you
will understand from your holiness’s vicars, Theodore and George, presbyters beloved of
God, and from John, the most religious deacon, and from Constantine, the most venerable
sub-deacon, all of them your spiritual children and our well-loved brethren. So too you will
hear the same things from those sent by your holy synod, the holy bishops who rightly and
uprightly, in accordance with your discipline, decreed with us in the first chapter of the
faith.</p>
<p>Thus, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and instructed by your doctrine, we have cast forth
the vile doctrines of impiety, making smooth the right path of orthodoxy, being in every
way encouraged and helped in so doing by the wisdom and power of our most pious and
serene Emperor Constantine. And then one of our number, the most holy præsul of this
reigning Constantinople, in the first place assenting to the orthodox compositions sent by
you to the most pious emperor as in all respects agreeable to the teaching of the approved
Fathers and of the God-instructed Fathers, and of the holy five universal councils, we all,
by the help of Christ our God, easily accomplished what we were striving after. For as God
was the mover, so God also he crowned our council.</p>
<p>Thereupon, therefore, the grace of the Holy Spirit shone upon us, displaying his power,
through your assiduous prayers, for the uprooting of all weeds and every tree which brought
not forth good fruit, and giving command that they should be consumed by fire. And we
all agree both in heart and tongue, and hand, and have put forth, by the assistance of the
life-giving Spirit, a definition, clean from all error, certain, and infallible; not ‘removing the
ancient landmarks,’ as it is written (God forbid!), but remaining steadfast in the testimonies
and authority of the holy and approved fathers, and defining that, as of two and in two
natures (to wit, the divinity and the humanity) of which he is composed and in which he

<pb n="663"/>
exists, Christ our true God is preached by us, and is glorified inseparably, unchangeably,
unconfusedly, and undividedly; just so also we predicate of him two natural operations,
undividedly, incontrovertibly, unconfusedly, inseparably, as has been declared in our synodal
definition. These decrees the majesty of our God-copying Emperor assented to, and
subscribed them with his own hand. And, as has been said, we rejected and condemned
that most impious and unsubstantial heresy which affirmed but one will and one operation
in the incarnate Christ our true God, and by so doing we have pressed sore upon the crowd
who confound and who divide, and have extinguished the inflamed storm of other heresies,
but we have set forth clearly with you the shining light of the orthodox faith, and we pray
your paternal sanctity to confirm our decree by your honourable rescript; through which
we confide in good hope in Christ that his merciful kindness will grant freely to the Roman
State, committed to the care of our most clement Emperor, stability; and will adorn with
daily yokes and victories his most serene clemency; and that in addition to the good things
he has here bestowed upon us, he will set your God-honoured holiness before his tremendous
tribunal as one who has sincerely confessed the true faith, preserving it unsullied and
keeping good ward over the orthodox flocks committed to him by God.</p>
<p>We and all who are with us salute all the brethren in Christ who are with your blessedness.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Condemnation of Pope Honorius.</head>
<p>To this decree attaches not only the necessary importance and interest which belongs
to any ecumenical decision upon a disputed doctrinal question with regard to the incarnation
of the Son of God, but an altogether accidental interest, arising from the fact that by this
decree a Pope of Rome is stricken with anathema in the person of Honorius. I need hardly
remind the reader how many interesting and difficult questions in theology such an action
on the part of an Ecumenical Council raises, and how all important, not to say vital, to such
as accept the ruling of the recent Vatican Council, it is that some explanation of this fact
should be arrived at which will be satisfactory. It would be highly improper for me in these
pages to discuss the matter theologically. Volumes on each side have been written on this
subject, and to these I must refer the reader, but in doing so I hope I may be pardoned if I
add a word of counsel—to read both sides. If one’s knowledge is derived only from modern
Eastern, Anglican or Protestant writers, such as “Janus and the Council,” the Père Gratry’s
“Letters,” or Littledale’s controversial books against Rome, one is apt to be as much onesided
as if he took his information from Cardinal Baronius, Cardinal Bellarmine,
Rohrbacher’s History, or from the recent work on the subject by Pennacchi.335 Perhaps the
average reader will hardly find a more satisfactory treatment than that by Bossuet in the
Defensio. (Liber VII., cap. xxi., etc.)</p>
<p>It will be sufficient for the purposes of this volume to state that Roman Catholic Curialist
writers are not at one as to how the matter is to be treated. Pennacchi, in his work referred
to above, is of opinion that Honorius’s letters were strictly speaking Papal decrees, set forth
auctoritate apostolica, and therefore irreformable, but he declares, contrary to the opinion
of almost all theologians and to the decree of this Council, that they are orthodox, and that
the Council erred in condemning them; as he expresses it, the decree rests upon an error in
facto dogmatico. To save an Ecumenical Synod from error, he thinks the synod ceased to
be ecumenical before it took this action, and was at that time only a synod of a number of
Orientals! Cardinal Baronius has another way out of the difficulty. He says that the name
of Honorius was forged and put in the decree by an erasure in the place of the name of
Theodore, the quondam Patriarch, who soon after the Council got himself restored to the
Patriarchal position. Baronius moreover holds that Honorius’s letters have been corrupted,
that the Acts of the Council have been corrupted, and, in short, that everything which declares
or proves that Honorius was a heretic or was condemned by an Ecumenical Council as such,
is untrustworthy and false. The groundlessness, not to say absurdity, of Baronius’s view
has been often exposed by those of his own communion, a brief but sufficient summary of
<note type="footnote">335 Pennacchi. De Honorii I., Romani Pontificis, causa in Concilio VI.</note>

<pb n="665"/>
the refutation will be found in Hefele, who while taking a very halting and unsatisfactory
position himself, yet is perfectly clear that Baronius’s contention is utterly indefensible.336</p>
<p>Most Roman controversialists of recent years have admitted both the fact of Pope
Honorius’s condemnation (which Baronius denies), and the monothelite (and therefore
heretical) character of his epistles, but they are of opinion that these letters were not his ex
cathedrâ utterances as Doctor Universalis, but mere expressions of the private opinion of
the Pontiff as a theologian. With this matter we have no concern in this connexion.</p>
<p>I shall therefore say nothing further on this point but shall simply supply the leading
proofs that Honorius was as a matter of fact condemned by the Sixth Ecumenical Council.</p>
<p>1. His condemnation is found in the Acts in the xiiith Session, near the beginning.</p>
<p>2. His two letters were ordered to be burned at the same session.</p>
<p>3. In the xvith Session the bishops exclaimed “Anathema to the heretic Sergius, to the
heretic Cyrus, to the heretic Honorius, etc.”</p>
<p>4. In the decree of faith published at the xviijth Session it is stated that “the originator
of all evil<gap reason="omitted"/>found a fit tool for his will in<gap reason="omitted"/>Honorius, Pope of Old Rome, etc.”</p>
<p>5. The report of the Council to the Emperor says that “Honorius, formerly bishop of
Rome” they had “punished with exclusion and anathema” because he followed the
monothelites.</p>
<p>6. In its letter to Pope Agatho the Council says it “has slain with anathema Honorius.”</p>
<p>7. The imperial decree speaks of the “unholy priests who infected the Church and falsely
governed” and mentions among them “Honorius, the Pope of Old Rome, the confirmer of
heresy who contradicted himself.” The Emperor goes on to anathematize “Honorius who
was Pope of Old Rome, who in everything agreed with them, went with them, and
strengthened the heresy.”</p>
<p>8. Pope Leo II. confirmed the decrees of the Council and expressly says that he too
anathematized Honorius.337</p>
<p>9. That Honorius was anathematized by the Sixth Council is mentioned in the Trullan
Canons (No. j.).</p>
<p>10. So too the Seventh Council declares its adhesion to the anathema in its decree of
faith, and in several places in the acts the same is said.</p>
<p>11. Honorius’s name was found in the Roman copy of the Acts. This is evident from
Anastasius’s life of Leo II. (Vita Leonis II.)</p>
<p>12. The Papal Oath as found in the Liber Diurnus338 taken by each new Pope from the
fifth to the eleventh century, in the form probably prescribed by Gregory II., “smites with
<note type="footnote">336 Hefele. History of the Councils. Vol. V., p. 190 et seqq.</note>
<note type="footnote">337 “Also Honorius, qui hanc apostolicam sedem non apostolicæ traditionis doctrina lustravit, sed profana
proditione immaculatam fidem subvertere conatus est, et omnes, qui in suo errore defuncti sunt.”</note>
<note type="footnote">338 Ed. Eugène de Rozière. Paris, 1869, No. 84.</note>

<pb n="666"/>
eternal anathema the originators of the new heresy, Sergius, etc., together with Honorius,
because he assisted the base assertion of the heretics.”</p>
<p>13. In the lesson for the feast of St. Leo II. in the Roman Breviary the name of Pope
Honorius occurs among those excommunicated by the Sixth Synod. Upon this we may well
hear Bossuet: “They suppress as far as they can, the Liber Diurnus: they have erased this
from the Roman Breviary. Have they therefore hidden it? Truth breaks out from all sides,
and these things become so much the more evident, as they are the more studiously put out
of sight.”339</p>
<p>With such an array of proof no conservative historian, it would seem, can question the
fact that Honorius, the Pope of Rome, was condemned and anathematized as a heretic by
the Sixth Ecumenical Council.</p>

<p>“The heresy of Apollinaris, etc., has been renewed by Theodore of Pharan and confirmed
by Honorius, sometime Pope of Old Rome, who also contradicted himself. Also Cyrus,
Pyrrhus, Paul, Peter; more recently. Macarius, Stephen, and Polychronius had diffused
Monothelitism. He, the Emperor, had therefore convoked this holy and Ecumenical Synod,
and published the present edict with the confession of faith, in order to confirm and establish
its decrees. (There follows here an extended confession of faith, with proofs for the doctrine
of two wills and operations.) As he recognized the five earlier Ecumenical Synods, so he
anathematized all heretics from Simon Magus, but especially the originator and patrons of
the new heresy, Theodore and Sergius; also Pope Honorius, who was their adherent and
patron in everything, and confirmed the heresy (τὸν κατὰ πάντα τούτοις συναιρέτην καὶ
σύνδρομον καὶ βεβαιωτὴν τῆς αἱρέσεως, further, Cyrus, etc., and ordained that no one
henceforth should hold a different faith, or venture to teach one will and one energy. In no
other than the orthodox faith could men be saved. Whoever did not obey the imperial edict
should, if he were a bishop or cleric be deposed; if an official, punished with confiscation
of property and loss of the girdle (ζώνη); if a private person, banished from the residence
and all other cities.”</p>

<head>THE CANONS OF THE COUNCIL IN TRULLO;
OFTEN CALLED
THE QUINISEXT COUNCIL.</head>

<p>Introductory Note.</p>

<pb n="669"/>
<head>Introductory Note.</head>
<p>From the fact that the canons of the Council in Trullo are included in this volume of
the Decrees and Canons of the Seven Ecumenical Councils it must not for an instant be
supposed that it is intended thereby to affirm that these canons have any ecumenical authority,
or that the council by which they were adopted can lay any claim to being ecumenical
either in view of its constitution or of the subsequent treatment by the Church of its enactments.</p>
<p>It is true that it claimed at the time an ecumenical character, and styled itself such in
several of its canons, it is true that in the mind of the Emperor Justinian II., who summoned
it, it was intended to have been ecumenical. It is true that the Greeks at first declared it to
be a continuation of the Sixth Synod and that by this name they frequently denominate and
quote its canons. But it is also true that the West was not really represented at it at all (as
we shall see presently); that when the Emperor afterwards sent the canons to the Pope to
receive his signature, he absolutely refused to have anything to do with them; and it is further
true that they were never practically observed by the West at all, and that even in the East
their authority was rather theoretical than real.</p>
<p>(Fleury. Histoire Ecclesiastique, Livre XL., Chap. xlix.)</p>
<p>As the two last General Councils (in 553 and in 681) had not made any Canons, the
Orientals judged it suitable to supply them eleven years after the Sixth Council, that is to
say, the year 692, fifth indiction. For that purpose the Emperor Justinian convoked a
Council, at which 211 Bishops attended, of whom the principal were the four Patriarchs,
Paul of Constantinople, Peter of Alexandria, Anastasius of Jerusalem, George of Antioch.
Next in the subscriptions are named John of Justinianopolis, Cyriacus of Cesarea in Cappadocia,
Basil of Gortyna in Crete, who says that he represents the whole Council of the
Roman Church, as he had said in subscribing the Sixth Council. But it is certain otherwise
that in this latter council there were present Legates of the Holy See. This council, like the
Sixth,340 assembled in the dome of the palace called in Latin Trullus, which name it has
kept. It is also named in Latin Quinisextum, in Greek Penthecton, as one might say, the
fifth-sixth, to mark that it is only the supplement of the two preceding Councils, though
properly it is a distinct one.</p>
<p>The intention was to make a body of discipline to serve thenceforth for the whole Church,
and it was distributed into 102 Canons.</p>
<note type="footnote">340 This statement of Fleury’s is contested by those who agree with Asseman in thinking that the Sixth Synod
was held in Santa Sophia, vide Biblioth. Jur., Orient. Tom. v., p. 85.</note>

<pb n="670"/>
<p>To this statement by Fleury some additions must be made. First, with regard to the
date of the synod. This is not so certain as would appear at first sight. At the Seventh Ecumenical
Council, the patriarch Tarasius of Constantinople asserted that, “four or five years
after the sixth Ecumenical Council the same bishops, in a new assembly under Justinian II.
had published the <del>Trullan</del> Canons mentioned,” and this assertion the Seventh Council
appears to have accepted as true, if we understand the sixth session aright. Now were this
statement true, the date would be probably 686, but this is impossible by the words of the
council itself, where we find mention made of the fifteenth of January of the past 4th indiction,
or the year of the world, 6109. To make this agree at all, scholars tell us that for iv.
must be read xiv. But the rest of the statement is equally erroneous, the bishops were not
the same, as can readily be seen by comparing the subscriptions to the Acts.</p>
<p>The year of the world 6109 is certainly wrong, and so other scholars would read 6199,
but here a division takes place, for some reckon by the Constantinopolitan era, and so fix
the date at 691, and others following the Alexandrian era fix it at 706. But this last is certainly
wrong, for the canons were sent for signature to Pope Sergius, who died as early as 701.
Hefele’s conclusion is as follows:</p>
<p>(Hefele. Hist. of the Councils, Vol. V., p. 222.)</p>
<p>The year 6199 of the Constantinopolitan era coincides with the year 691 after Christ
and the IVth Indiction ran from September 1, 690, to August 31, 691. If then, our Synod,
in canon iij., speaks of the 15th of January in the past Indiction IV., it means January 691;
but it belongs itself, to the Vth Indiction, i.e., it was opened after September 1, 691, and before
September 1, 692.</p>
<p>As this is not a history of the Councils but a collection of their decrees and canons with
illustrative notes, the only other point to be considered is the reception these canons met
with.</p>
<p>The decrees were signed first by the Emperor, the next place was left vacant for the
Pope, then followed the subscriptions of the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem,
and Antioch, the whole number being 211, bishops or representatives of bishops.
It is not quite certain whether any of the Patriarchs were present except Paul of Constantinople;
but taking it all in all the probability is in favour of their presence.341 Blank
places were left for the bishops of Thessalonica, Sardinia, Ravenna and Corinth. The
Archbishop of Gortyna in Crete added to his signature the phrase “Holding the place of the
holy Church of Rome in every synod.” He had in the same way signed the decrees of III.
Constantinople, Crete belonging to the Roman Patriarchate; as to whether his delegation
<note type="footnote">341 Cf. Hefele, l.c., Vol. V., 237. On the other hand vide Asseman (l.c. Tom. V., pp. 30, 69), who thinks Alexandria
and Jerusalem were vacant at the time!</note>

<pb n="671"/>
on the part of the Roman Synod continued or was merely made to continue by his own volition
we have no information. The ridiculous blunder of Balsamon must be noted here,
who asserts that the bishops whose names are missing and for which blank places were left,
had actually signed.</p>
<p>Pope Sergius refused to sign the decrees when they were sent to him, rejected them as
“lacking authority” (invalidi) and described them as containing “novel errors.” With the
efforts to extort his signature we have no concern further than to state that they signally
failed. Later on, in the time of Pope Constantine, a middle course seems to have been adopted,
a course subsequently in the ninth century thus expressed by Pope John VIII., “he accepted
all those canons which did not contradict the true faith, good morals, and the decrees
of Rome,” a truly notable statement! Nearly a century later Pope Hadrian I. distinctly recognizes
all the Trullan decrees in his letter to Tenasius of Constantinople and attributes them
to the Sixth Synod. “All the holy six synods I receive with all their canons, which rightly
and divinely were promulgated by them, among which is contained that in which reference
is made to a Lamb being pointed to by the Precursor as being found in certain of the venerable
images.” Here the reference is unmistakably to the Trullan Canon LXXXII.</p>
<p>Hefele’s summing up of the whole matter is as follows:</p>
<p>(Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. V., p. 242.)</p>
<p>That the Seventh Ecumenical Council at Nice ascribed the Trullan canons to the Sixth
Ecumenical Council, and spoke of them entirely in the Greek spirit, cannot astonish us, as
it was attended almost solely by Greeks. They specially pronounced the recognition of the
canons in question in their own first canon; but their own canons have never received the
ratification of the Holy See.</p>
<p>Thus far Hefele, but it seems that Gratian’s statement on the subject in the Decretum
should not be omitted here. (Pars I. Dist. XVI., c. v.)</p>
<p>“Canon V. The Sixth Synod is confirmed by the authority of Hadrian.</p>
<p>“I receive the Sixth Synod with all its canons.</p>
<p>“Gratian. There is a doubt whether it set forth canons but this is easily removed by examining
the fourth session of the VIIth <del>VIth by mistake, vide Roman Correctors’ note</del> Synod.</p>
<p>“For Peter the Bp. of Nicomedia says:</p>
<p>“C. VI. The Sixth Synod wrote canons.</p>
<p>“I have a book containing the canons of the holy Sixth Synod. The Patriarch said: § 1.
Some are scandalized through their ignorance of these canons, saying: Did the Sixth Synod
make any canons? Let them know then that the Sixth Holy Synod was gathered together
under Constantine against those who said there is one operation and one will in Christ, in
which the holy Fathers anathematized these as heretics and explained the orthodox faith.</p>

<pb n="672"/>
<p>“II. Pars § 2. And the synod was dissolved in the XIVth year of Constantine. After four
or five years the same holy Fathers met together under Justinian, the son of Constantine,
and promulgated the aforementioned canons, of which let no one have any doubt. For they
who under Constantine were in synod, these same bishops under Justinian subscribed to
all these canons. For it was fitting that a Universal Synod should promulgate ecclesiastical
canons. Item: § 3. The Holy Sixth Synod after it promulgated its definition against the
Monothelites, the emperor Constantine who had summoned it, dying soon after, and
Justinian his son reigning in his stead, the same holy synod divinely inspired again met at
Constantinople four or five years afterwards, and promulgated one hundred and two canons
for the correction of the Church.</p>
<p>“Gratian. From this therefore it may be gathered that the Sixth Synod was twice assembled:
the first time under Constantine and then passed no canons; the second time under Justinian
his son, and promulgated the aforesaid canons.”</p>
<p>Upon this passage of Gratian’s the Roman Correctors have a long and interesting note,
with quotations from Anastasius, which should be read with care by the student but is too
long to cite here.</p>
<p>I close with some eminently wise remarks by Prof. Michaud.</p>
<p>(E. Michaud, Discussion sur les Sept Conciles OEcuméniques, p. 272.)</p>
<p>Upon the canons of this council we must remark:</p>
<p>1. That save its acceptance of the dogmatic decisions of the six Ecumenical Councils,
which is contained in the first canon, this council had an exclusively disciplinary character;
and consequently if it should be admitted by the particular churches, these would always
remain, on account of their autonomy, judges of the fitness or non-suitability of the practical
application of these decisions.</p>
<p>2. That the Easterns have never pretended to impose this code upon the practice of the
Western Churches, especially as they themselves do not practise everywhere the hundred
and two canons mentioned. All they wished to do was to maintain the ancient discipline
against the abuses and evil innovations of the Roman Church, and to make her pause upon
the dangerous course in which she was already beginning to enter.</p>
<p>3. That if among these canons, some do not apply to the actual present state of society,
e.g., the 8th, 10th, 11th, etc.; if others, framed in a spirit of transition between the then
Eastern customs and those of Rome, do not appear as logical nor as wise as one might desire,
e.g., the 6th, 12th, 48th, etc., nevertheless on the other hand, many of them are marked with
the most profound sagacity.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<head>Canon I.</head>
<p>That order is best of all which makes every word and act begin and end in God.
Wherefore that piety may be clearly set forth by us and that the Church of which Christ is
the foundation may be continually increased and advanced, and that it may be exalted above
the cedars of Lebanon; now therefore we, by divine grace at the beginning of our decrees,
define that the faith set forth by the God-chosen Apostles who themselves had both seen
and were ministers of the Word, shall be preserved without any innovation, unchanged and
inviolate.</p>
<p>Moreover the faith of the three hundred and eighteen holy and blessed fathers who were
assembled at Nice under Constantine our Emperor, against the impious Arius, and the
gentile diversity of deity or rather (to speak accurately) multitude of gods taught by him,
who by the unanimous acknowledgment of the faithful revealed and declared to us the
consubstantiality of the Three Persons comprehended in the Divine Nature, not suffering
this faith to lie hidden under the bushel of ignorance, but openly teaching the faithful to
adore with one worship the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, confuting and scattering
to the winds the opinion of different grades, and demolishing and overturning the puerile
toyings fabricated out of sand by the heretics against orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Likewise also we confirm that faith which was set forth by the one hundred and fifty
fathers who in the time of Theodosius the Elder, our Emperor, assembled in this imperial
city, accepting their decisions with regard to the Holy Ghost in assertion of his godhead,
and expelling the profane Macedonius (together with all previous enemies of the truth) as
one who dared to judge Him to be a servant who is Lord, and who wished to divide, like a
robber, the inseparable unity, so that there might be no perfect mystery of our faith.</p>
<p>And together with this odious and detestable contender against the truth, we condemn
Apollinaris, priest of the same iniquity, who impiously belched forth that the Lord assumed
a body unendowed with a soul,342 thence also inferring that his salvation wrought for us
was imperfect.</p>
<p>Moreover what things were set forth by the two hundred God-bearing fathers in the
city of Ephesus in the days of Theodosius our Emperor, the son of Arcadius; these doctrines
we assent to as the unbroken strength of piety, teaching that Christ the incarnate Son of
God is one; and declaring that she who bare him without human seed was the immaculate
Ever-Virgin, glorifying her as literally and in very truth the Mother of God. We condemn
<note type="footnote">342 Latin reads “mind or soul.”</note>

<pb n="674"/>
as foreign to the divine scheme the absurd division of Nestorius, who teaches that the one
Christ consists of a man separately and of the Godhead separately and renews the Jewish
impiety.</p>
<p>Moreover we confirm that faith which at Chalcedon, the Metropolis, was set forth in
accordance with orthodoxy by the six hundred and thirty God-approved fathers in the time
of Marcian, who was our Emperor, which handed down with a great and mighty voice, even
unto the ends of the earth, that the one Christ, the son of God, is of two natures, and must
be glorified343 in these two natures, and which cast forth from the sacred precincts of the
Church as a black pestilence to be avoided, Eutyches, babbling stupidly and inanely, and
teaching that the great mystery of the incarnation (οἰκονωμίας) was perfected in thought
only. And together with him also Nestorius and Dioscorus of whom the former was the
defender and champion of the division, the latter of the confusion <del>of the two natures in
the one Christ</del>, both of whom fell away from the divergence of their impiety to a common
depth of perdition and denial of God.</p>
<p>Also we recognize as inspired by the Spirit the pious voices of the one hundred and
sixty-five God-bearing fathers who assembled in this imperial city in the time of our Emperor
Justinian of blessed memory, and we teach them to those who come after us; for these synodically
anathematized and execrated Theodore of Mopsuestia (the teacher of Nestorius),
and Origen, and Didymus, and Evagrius, all of whom reintroduced feigned Greek myths,
and brought back again the circlings of certain bodies and souls, and deranged turnings <del>or
transmigrations</del> to the wanderings or dreamings of their minds, and impiously insulting
the resurrection of the dead. Moreover <del>they condemned</del> what things were written by
Theodoret against the right faith and against the Twelve Chapters of blessed Cyril, and that
letter which is said to have been written by Ibas.</p>
<p>Also we agree to guard untouched the faith of the Sixth Holy Synod, which first assembled
in this imperial city in the time of Constantine, our Emperor, of blessed memory,
which faith received still greater confirmation from the fact that the pious Emperor ratified
with his own signet that which was written for the security of future generations. This
council taught that we should openly profess our faith that in the incarnation of Jesus Christ,
our true God, there are two natural wills or volitions and two natural operations; and condemned
by a just sentence those who adulterated the true doctrine and taught the people
that in the one Lord Jesus Christ there is but one will and one operation; to wit, Theodore
of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Honorius of Rome, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who
were bishops of this God-preserved city; Macarius, who was bishop of Antioch; Stephen,
who was his disciple, and the insane Polychronius, depriving them henceforth from the
communion of the body of Christ our God.</p>
<note type="footnote">343 Latin, “believed in.”</note>

<pb n="675"/>
<p>And, to say so once for all, we decree that the faith shall stand firm and remain unsullied
until the end of the world as well as the writings divinely handed down and the teachings
of all those who have beautified and adorned the Church of God and were lights in the
world, having embraced the word of life. And we reject and anathematize those whom they
rejected and anathematized, as being enemies of the truth, and as insane ragers against God,
and as lifters up of iniquity.</p>
<p>But if any one at all shall not observe and embrace the aforesaid pious decrees, and teach
and preach in accordance therewith, but shall attempt to set himself in opposition thereto,
let him be anathema, according to the decree already promulgated by the approved holy
and blessed Fathers, and let him be cast out and stricken off as an alien from the number
of Christians. For our decrees add nothing to the things previously defined, nor do they
take anything away, nor have we any such power.</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>It has also seemed good to this holy Council, that the eighty-five canons, received and
ratified by the holy and blessed Fathers before us, and also handed down to us in the name
of the holy and glorious Apostles should from this time forth remain firm and unshaken
for the cure of souls and the healing of disorders. And in these canons we are bidden to
receive the Constitutions of the Holy Apostles <del>written</del> by Clement. But formerly through
the agency of those who erred from the faith certain adulterous matter was introduced,
clean contrary to piety, for the polluting of the Church, which obscures the elegance and
beauty of the divine decrees in their present form. We therefore reject these Constitutions
so as the better to make sure of the edification and security of the most Christian flock; by
no means admitting the offspring of heretical error, and cleaving to the pure and perfect
doctrine of the Apostles. But we set our seal likewise upon all the other holy canons set
forth by our holy and blessed Fathers, that is, by the 318 holy God-bearing Fathers assembled
at Nice, and those at Ancyra, further those at Neocæsarea and likewise those at Gangra, and
besides, those at Antioch in Syria: those too at Laodicea in Phrygia: and likewise the 150
who assembled in this heaven-protected royal city: and the 200 who assembled the first
time in the metropolis of the Ephesians, and the 630 holy and blessed Fathers at Chalcedon.
In like manner those of Sardica, and those of Carthage: those also who again assembled in
this heaven-protected royal city under its bishop Nectarius and Theophilus Archbishop of
Alexandria. Likewise too the Canons <del>i.e. the decretal letters</del>of Dionysius, formerly
Archbishop of the great city of Alexandria; and of Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria and
Martyr; of Gregory the Wonder-worker, Bishop of Neocæsarea; of Athanasius, Archbishop
of Alexandria; of Basil, Archbishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; of Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa;
of Gregory Theologus; of Amphilochius of Iconium; of Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria;
of Theophilus, Archbishop of the same great city of Alexandria; of Cyril, Archbishop of the
same Alexandria; of Gennadius, Patriarch of this heaven-protected royal city. Moreover
the Canon set forth by Cyprian, Archbishop of the country of the Africans and Martyr, and
by the Synod under him, which has been kept only in the country of the aforesaid Bishops,
according to the custom delivered down to them. And that no one be allowed to transgress
or disregard the aforesaid canons, or to receive others beside them, supposititiously set forth
by certain who have attempted to make a traffic of the truth. But should any one be convicted
of innovating upon, or attempting to overturn, any of the afore-mentioned canons, he shall
be subject to receive the penalty which that canon imposes, and to be cured by it of his
transgression.</p>

<p>Whatever additions have been made through guile by the heterodox in the Apostolic
Constitutions edited by Clement, shall be cut out.</p>
<p>This canon defines what canons are to be understood as having received the sanction
of ecumenical authority, and since these canons of the Council in Trullo were received at
the Seventh Ecumenical Council in its first canon as the canons of the Sixth Ecumenical (of
which the Quinisext claimed to be a legitimate continuation) there can be no doubt that all
these canons enumerated in this canon are set forth for the guidance of the Church.</p>
<p>With regard to what councils are intended: there is difficulty only in two particulars,
viz., the “Council of Constantinople under Nectarius and Theophilus,”344 and the “Council
under Cyprian;” the former must be the Council of 394, and the latter is usually considered
to be the III. Synod of Carthage, a.d. 257.</p>

what canon is referred to unless it is the preface to the council of St. Cyprian where he says
that no one should pretend to be bishop of bishops, or to oblige his colleagues to obey him
by tyrannical fear.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that while the canon is most careful to mention the exact number of
Apostolic canons it received, thus deciding in favour of the larger code, it is equally careful
not to assign them an Apostolic origin, but merely to say that they had come down to them
“in the name of” the Apostles. In the face of this it is strange to find Balsamon saying,
“Through this canon their mouth is stopped who say that 85 canons were not set forth by
the holy Apostles;” what the council did settle, so far as its authority went, was the number
not the authorship of the canons. This, I think, is all that Balsamon intended to assert, but
his words might easily be quoted as having a different meaning.</p>

<head>Canon III.</head>
<p>Since our pious and Christian Emperor has addressed this holy and ecumenical council,
in order that it might provide for the purity of those who are in the list of the clergy, and
who transmit divine things to others, and that they may be blameless ministrants, and worthy
of the sacrifice of the great God, who is both Offering and High Priest, a sacrifice apprehended
by the intelligence: and that it might cleanse away the pollutions wherewith these have been
branded by unlawful marriages: now whereas they of the most holy Roman Church purpose
to keep the rule of exact perfection, but those who are under the throne of this heavenprotected
and royal city keep that of kindness and consideration, so blending both together
as our fathers have done, and as the love of God requires, that neither gentleness fall into
licence, nor severity into harshness; especially as the fault of ignorance has reached no small
number of men, we decree, that those who are involved in a second marriage, and have been
slaves to sin up to the fifteenth of the past month of January, in the past fourth Indiction,
the 6109th year, and have not resolved to repent of it, be subjected to canonical deposition:
but that they who are involved in this disorder of a second marriage, but before our decree
have acknowledged what is fitting, and have cut off their sin, and have put far from them
this strange and illegitimate connexion, or they whose wives by second marriage are already
dead, or who have turned to repentance of their own accord, having learnt continence, and
having quickly forgotten their former iniquities, whether they be presbyters or deacons,
these we have determined should cease from all priestly ministrations or exercise, being
under punishment for a certain time, but should retain the honour of their seat and station,
being satisfied with their seat before the laity and begging with tears from the Lord that the
transgression of their ignorance be pardoned them: for unfitting it were that he should bless
another who has to tend his own wounds. But those who have been married to one wife, if
she was a widow, and likewise those who after their ordination have unlawfully entered into
one marriage that is, presbyters, and deacons, and subdeacons, being debarred for some
short time from sacred ministration, and censured, shall be restored again to their proper
rank, never advancing to any further rank, their unlawful marriage being openly dissolved.
This we decree to hold good only in the case of those that are involved in the aforesaid faults
up to the fifteenth (as was said) of the month of January, of the fourth Indiction, decreeing
from the present time, and renewing the Canon which declares, that he who has been joined
in two marriages after his baptism, or has had a concubine, cannot be bishop, or presbyter,
or deacon, or at all on the sacerdotal list; in like manner, that he who has taken a widow, or
a divorced person, or a harlot, or a servant, or an actress, cannot be bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, or at all on the sacerdotal list.</p>

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>Priests who shall have contracted second marriages and will not give them up are to be
deposed. But those who leave off the wickedness, let them cease for a fixed period. For he that
is himself wounded does not bless. But who are implicated in nefarious marriage and who
after ordination have contracted marriage, after a definite time they shall be restored to their
grade, provided they remain without offence, having plainly broken off the marriage. But if
after it shall have been prohibited by this decree they attempt to do so they shall remain deposed.</p>

<p>What things pertain to this third canon are only adapted to the time in which the canon
was passed; and afterwards are of no force at all. But what things the Fathers wished to be
binding on posterity are contained in the seventeenth and eighteenth canons of the holy
Apostles, which as having been neglected during the course of time this synod wished to
renew.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>It is clear from this canon that the Emperor very especially intended that the indulgence
which the Church of Constantinople extended to its presbyters and deacons in allowing
them the use of marriage entered into before ordination, should not be allowed to go any
further, nor to be an occasion for the violation of that truly Apostolic canon, “The bishop,
the presbyter, and the deacon must be the husband of one wife.” I Tim. iii. 2.</p>
<p>For never did the Constantinopolitan nor any other Eastern Church allow by canon a
digamist (or a man successively the husband of many wives) to be advanced to the order of
presbyter or deacon, or to use any second marriage.</p>
<p>Antonio Pereira.</p>
<p>(Tentativa Theologica. <del>Eng. trans.</del> III. Principle, p. 79.)</p>
<p>In the same manner a second marriage always, and everywhere, incapacitated the clergy
for Holy Orders and the Episcopate. This appears from St. Paul, 1 Tim. Chap. iii., and Titus,
Chap. i., and it was expressly enacted by the sixteenth of the Apostolical Canons, renewed
by the Popes Siricius, Innocent and Leo the Great, and may be gathered from the ancient
fathers and councils generally received in the Church.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we know from Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, that many bishops remarkable
for their learning and sanctity, frequently dispensed with this Apostolical law; as Alexander
of Antioch, Acacius of Berea, Praylius of Jerusalem, Proclus of Constantinople, and others,
by whose example Theodoret defends his own conduct in the case of Irenæus, in ordaining
him Archbishop of Tyre, although he had been twice married. But what is more surprising

<pb n="681"/>
in this matter is that, notwithstanding the eleventh Decretal of Siricius, and the twelfth of
Innocentius the First, that they who had either been twice married, or had married widows,
were incapable of ordination, and ought to be deposed; the Council of Toledo, Canon 3,
and the First Council of Orange, Canon 25, both dispensed with these Pontifical laws. The
first, in order that those who had married widows might remain in holy orders; the second,
that such as had twice married might be promoted to the order of subdeacon. Socrates also
observes that although it was a general law not to admit catechumens to orders, the bishops
of Alexandria were in the habit of promoting such to the order of readers and singers.</p>
<p>Fleury.</p>
<p>(H. E., Liv. XL., chap. 1.)</p>
<p>These canons of the Council of Trullo have served ever since to the Greeks and to all
the Christians of the East as the universal rule with regard to clerical continence, and they
have been now in full force for a thousand years. That is to say, It is not permitted to men
who are clerics in Holy Orders to marry after their ordination. Bishops must keep perfect
continence, whether before their consecration they are married or not. Priests, deacons,
and subdeacons already married can keep their wives and live with them, except on the days
they are to approach the holy mysteries.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Marriage of the Clergy.</head>
<p>On this subject there is a popular misconception which must first be removed. In the
popular mind to-day there is no distinction between “a married clergy” being allowed, and
“the marriage of the clergy” being allowed; even theological writers who have attained some
repute have confused these two things in the most unfortunate and perplexing fashion. It
will suffice to mention as an instance of this Bp. Harold Browne in his book on the XXXIX.
Articles, in which not only is the confusion above spoken of made, but the very blunder is
used for controversial purposes, to back up and support by the authority of the ancient
Church in the East (which allowed a married clergy) the practice of the Nestorians and of
the modern Church of England, both of which tolerate the marriage of the clergy, a thing
which the ancient Church abhorred and punished with deposition.</p>
<p>I cannot better express the doctrine and practice of the ancient Church in the East than
by quoting the words of the Rev. John Fulton in the Introduction to the Third Edition of
his Index Canonum.345 He says: “Marriage was no impediment to ordination even as a
Bishop; and Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, equally with other men, were forbidden to put
away their wives under pretext of religion. The case was different when a man was unmarried
at the time of his ordination. Then he was held to have given himself wholly to God in the
office of the Holy Ministry, and he was forbidden to take back from his offering that measure
of his cares and his affections which must necessarily be given to the maintenance and
nurture of his family. In short, the married man might be ordained, but with a few exceptions
no man was allowed to marry after ordination.” In his “Digest” sub voce “Celibacy” he gives
the earliest canon law on the subject as follows: “None of the clergy, except readers and
singers may marry after ordination (Ap. Can. xxvi.); but deacons may marry, if at their ordination
they have declared an intention to do so (Ancyra x.). A priest who marries is to
be deposed (Neocæsarea i.). A deaconess who marries is to be anathematized (Chal. xv.);
a monk or dedicated virgin who marries, is to be excommunicated (Chal. xvi.). Those who
break their vows of celibacy are to fulfil the penance of digamists (Ancyra xix.).”346</p>
<p>We may then take it for a general principle that in no part of the ancient Church was a
priest allowed to contract holy matrimony; and in no place was he allowed to exercise his
priesthood afterwards, if he should dare to enter into such a relation with a woman. As I
have so often remarked it is not my place to approve or disapprove this law of the Church,
my duty is the much simpler one of tracing historically what the law was and what it is in
the East and West to-day. The Reformers considered that in this, as in most other matters,
these venerable churches had made a mistake, but neither the maintenance nor the disproof
of this opinion in any way concerns me, so far as this volume is concerned. All that is ne-

<pb n="686"/>
cessary for me to do is to affirm that if a priest were at any time to attempt to marry, he
would be attempting to do that which from the earliest times of which we have any record,
no priest has ever been allowed to do, but which always has been punished as a gross sin of
immorality.</p>
<p>In tracing the history of this subject, the only time during which any real difficulty
presents itself is the first three centuries, after that all is much clearer, and my duty is simply
to lay the undisputed facts of the case before the reader.</p>
<p>We begin then with the debatable ground. And first with regard to the Lord, “the great
High Priest of our profession,” of course there can be no doubt that he set the example,
or—if any think that he was not a pattern for the priests of his Church to follow—at least
lived the life, of celibacy. When we come to the question of what was the practice of his
first followers in this matter, there would likewise seem to be but little if any reasonable
doubt. For while of the Apostles we have it recorded only of Peter that he was a married
man, we have it also expressly recorded that in his case, as in that of all the rest who had
“forsaken all” to follow him, the Lord himself said, “Every one that hath forsaken houses,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s
sake shall receive an hundred fold and shall inherit eternal life.”347</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that St. Paul in his epistles allows and even contemplates the
probability that those admitted to the ranks of the clergy will have been already married,
but distinctly says that they must have been the “husband of one wife,”348 by which all antiquity
and every commentator of gravity recognizes that digamists are cut off from the
possibility of ordination, but there is nothing to imply that the marital connexion was to be
continued after ordination. For a thorough treatment of this whole subject from the ancient
and Patristic point of view, the reader is referred to St. Jerome.349</p>
<p>The next stage in our progress is marked by the so-called Apostolical Canons. Now for
those who hold that these canons had directly or indirectly the Apostles for their author, or
that as we have them now they are all of even sub-Apostolic date, the matter becomes more
simple, for while indeed these canons do not expressly set forth the law subsequently formulated
for the East, they certainly seem to be not inconsistent therewith, but rather to look
that way, especially Canons V. and LI. But few will be found willing to support so extreme
an hypothesis, and while indeed many scholars are of opinion that most of the canons of
the collection we style “Apostolical,” are ante-Nicene, yet they will not be recognized as of
more value than as so many mirrors, displaying what was at their date considered pure
<note type="footnote">347 Matt. xix. 29; Lk. xviii. 29. In Mark x. 29 is found the same incident recorded, but while “wife” is mentioned

discipline. It is abundantly clear that the fathers in council in Trullo thought the discipline
they were setting forth to be the original discipline of the Church in the matter, and the
discipline of the West an innovation, but that such was really the case seems far from certain.
Thomassinus treats this point with much learning, and I shall cite some of the authorities
he brings forward. Of these the most important is Epiphanius, who as a Greek would be
certain to give the tradition of the East, had there been any such tradition known in his
time. I give the three great passages.</p>
<p>“It is evident that those from the priesthood are chiefly taken from the order of virgins,
or if not from virgins, at least from monks; or if not from the order of monks, then they are
wont to be made priests who keep themselves from their wives, or who are widows after a
single marriage. But he that has been entangled by a second marriage is not admitted to
priesthood in the Church, even if he be continent from his wife, or be a widower. Anyone
of this sort is rejected from the grade of bishop, presbyter, deacon, or subdeacon. The order
of reader, however, can be chosen from all the orders these grades can be chosen from, that
is to say from virgins, monks, the continent, widowers, and they who are bound by honest
marriage. Moreover, if necessity so compel, even digamists may be lectors, for such is not
a priest, etc., etc.”350</p>
<p>“Christ taught us by an example that the priestly work and ornaments should be communicated
to those who shall have preserved their continency after a single marriage, or
shall have persevered in virginity. And this the Apostles thereafter honestly and piously
decreed, through the ecclesiastical canon of the priesthood.”351</p>
<p>“Nay, moreover, he that still uses marriage, and begets children, even though the husband
of but one wife, is by no means admitted by the Church to the order of deacon, presbyter,
bishop, or subdeacon. But for all this, he who shall have kept himself from the commerce
of his one wife, or has been deprived of her, may be ordained, and this is most usually the
case in those places where the ecclesiastical canons are most accurately observed.”352</p>
<p>Nor is the weight of this evidence lessened, but much increased, by the acknowledgment
of the same father that in some places in his days the celibate life was not observed by such
priests as had wives, for he explains that such a state of things had come about “not from
following the authority of the canons, but through the neglect of men, which is wont at
certain periods to be the case.”353</p>
<p>The witness of the Western Fathers although so absolutely and indisputably clear is not
so conclusive as to the East, and yet one passage from St. Jerome should be quoted. “The
<note type="footnote">350 Epiph. Exposit. Fid. Cath., c. xxi.</note>
<note type="footnote">351 Ibid. Hæresi. 48, n. 7.</note>

<pb n="688"/>
Virgin Christ and the Virgin Mary dedicated the virginity of both sexes. The Apostles were
chosen when either virgins or continent after marriage, and bishops, presbyters, and deacons
are chosen either when virgins, or widowers, or at least continent forever after the priesthood.”354</p>
<p>It would be out of place to enter into any detailed argument upon the force of these
passages, but I shall lay before the reader the summing up of the whole matter by a weighty
recent writer of the Ultramontane Roman School.</p>
<p>“Is the celibate an Apostolic ordinance? Bickel affirmed that it is, and Funk denied it
in 1878. To-day <del>1896</del> canonists commonly admit that one cannot prove the existence of
any formal precept, either divine or apostolic, which imposes the celibate upon the clergy,
and that all the texts, whether taken out of Holy Scripture or from the Fathers, on this subject
contain merely a counsel, and not a command.” “In the Fourth Century a great number of
councils forbade bishops, priests, and deacons to live in the use of marriage with their lawful
wives.<gap reason="omitted"/>But there does not appear to have been any disposition to declare by law as invalid
the marriages of clerics in Holy Orders. In the Fifth and Sixth Centuries the law of the celibate
was observed by all the Churches of the West, thanks to the Councils and to the Popes.”
“In the Seventh and down to the end of the Tenth Century,355 as a matter of fact the law of
celibacy was little observed in a great part of the Western Church, but as a matter of law the
Roman Pontiffs and the Councils were constant in their proclamation of its obligation.”
By the canonical practice of the unreformed West, the reception of Holy Orders is an impedimentum
dirimens matrimonii, which renders any marriage subsequently contracted not
only illicit but absolutely null. On this diriment impediment the same Roman Catholic
writer says: “The diriment impediment of Holy Orders is of ecclesiastical obligation and
not of divine, and consequently the Church can dispense it. This is the present teaching
which is in opposition to that of the old schools.”</p>
<p>“There is no question of the nullity of the marriages contracted by clerics before 1139.
At the Council of the Lateran of that year, Innocent II. declared that these marriages contracted
in contempt of the ecclesiastical law are not true marriages in his eyes. His successors
do not seem to have insisted much upon this new diriment impediment, although it was
attacked most vigorously by the offending clergymen; but the School of Bologna, the authority
of which was then undisputed, openly declared for the nullity of the marriages contracted
by clerics in Holy Orders. Thus it is that this point of law has been settled rather by teaching,
than by any precise text, or by any law of a known date.”356</p>

<p>It should not, however, be forgotten that although this is true with regard to Pope Innocent
II. in 1139, it is also true that in 530 the Emperor Justinian declared null and void all
marriages contracted by clerics in Holy Orders, and the children of such marriages to be
spurious (spurii).</p>
<p>The reader will be interested in reading the answer on this point made by King Henry
VIII. to the letter sent him by the German ambassadors.357 I can here give but a part
translated into English. “Although the Church from the beginning admitted married men,
as priests and bishops, who were without crime, the husband of one wife, (out of the necessity
of the times, as sufficient other suitable men could not be found as would suffice for the
teaching of the world) yet Paul himself chose the celibate Timothy; but if anyone came unmarried
to the priesthood and afterwards took a wife, he was always deposed from the
priesthood, according to the canon of the Council of Neocæsarea which was before that of
Nice. So, too, in the Council of Chalcedon, in the first canon of which all former canons
are confirmed, it is established that a deaconess, if she give herself over to marriage, shall
remain under anathema, and a virgin who had dedicated herself to God and a monk who
join themselves in marriage, shall remain excommunicated.<gap reason="omitted"/>No Apostolic canon nor the
Council of Nice contain anything similar to what you assert, viz.: that priests once ordained
can marry afterwards. And with this statement agrees the Sixth Synod, in which it was decreed
that if any of the clergy should wish to lead a wife, he should do so before receiving
the Subdiaconate, since afterwards it was by no means lawful; nor was there given in the
Sixth Synod any liberty to priests of leading wives after their priesting, as you assert.
Therefore from the beginning of the newborn Church it is clearly seen that at no time it was
permitted to a priest to lead a wife after his priesting, and nowhere, where this was attempted,
was it done with impunity, but the culprit was deposed from his priesthood.”</p>

<head>Canon VII.</head>
<p>Since we have learned that in some churches deacons hold ecclesiastical offices, and
that hereby some of them with arrogancy and license sit daringly before the presbyters: we
have determined that a deacon, even if in an office of dignity, that is to say, in whatever ecclesiastical
office he may be, is not to have his seat before a presbyter, except he is acting as
representative of his own patriarch or metropolitan in another city under another superior,
for then he shall be honoured as filling his place. But if anyone, possessed with a tyrannical
audacity, shall have dared to do such a thing, let him be ejected from his peculiar rank and
be last of all of the order in whose list he is in his own church; our Lord admonishing us
that we are not to delight in taking the chief seats, according to the doctrine which is found
in the holy Evangelist Luke, as put forth by our Lord and God himself. For to those who
were called he taught this parable: “When ye are bidden by anyone to a marriage sit not
down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou shall have been bidden
by him; and he who bade thee and him come and say to thee: Give this man place, and thou
begin with shame to take the lowest room. But when thou art bidden, sit down in the lowest
place, so that when he who bade thee cometh he may say to thee, Friend go up higher: then
thou shalt have worship in the presence of them that sit with thee. For whosoever exalteth
himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” But the same thing
also shall be observed in the remaining sacred orders; seeing that we know that spiritual
things are to be preferred to worldly dignity.</p>

<p>A deacon in the execution of his office, if he shall have occasion to sit in the presence of
presbyters, shall take the lowest place unless he be the representative of the Patriarch or bishop.</p>
<p>Balsamon, Zonaras, and following them Van Espen point out that this canon is a relaxation
of the XVIII. Canon of Nice which punishes presumptuous deacons not only with
loss of rank in their grade, but also with expulsion from their ministry.</p>
<p>Van Espen well remarks that the Fathers of this synod had in mind not only the pres
ervation of the distinction between deacons and presbyters, but also between those in ecclesiastical
orders and those enjoying secular dignities with regard to ecclesiastical matters,
but who were not to gain there from ecclesiastical precedence. This is what is meant by the
last clause of the canon.</p>

OEconomus, Magno Sacello Præpositus, Magnus Vasorum Custos, Chartophylax, Parvo

<p>Since we desire that in every point the things which have been decreed by our holy
fathers may also be established and confirmed, we hereby renew the canon which orders
that synods of the bishops of each province be held every year where the bishop of the
metropolis shall deem best. But since on account of the incursions of barbarians and certain
other incidental causes, those who preside over the churches cannot hold synods twice a
year, it seems right that by all means once a year—on account of ecclesiastical questions
which are likely to arise—a synod of the aforesaid bishops should be holden in every province,
between the holy feast of Easter and October, as has been said above, in the place which the
Metropolitan shall have deemed most fitting. And let such bishops as do not attend, when
they are at home in their own cities and are in good health, and free from all unavoidable

<p>Theodore Balsamon is of opinion that this canon does not forbid the eating of unleavened
bread; but that what is intended is the keeping of feasts in a Jewish fashion, or in sacrifices
to use unleavened bread (azymes), and this, says Balsamon, on account of the Latins who
celebrate their feasts with azymes.</p>
<p>Canon lxix. <del>i.e., lxx.</del> of those commonly called Apostolic forbids the observance of

<p>While there can be no doubt that in all the Trullan canons there is an undercurrent of
hostility to the West, yet in this canon I can see no such spirit, and I think it has been read
into it by the greater bitterness of later times. This seems the more certain from the fact
that there is nothing new whatever in the provision with respect to the passover bread, vide

<p>Moreover this also has come to our knowledge, that in Africa and Libya and in other
places the most God-beloved bishops in those parts do not refuse to live with their wives,
even after consecration, thereby giving scandal and offence to the people. Since, therefore,
it is our particular care that all things tend to the good of the flock placed in our hands and
committed to us,—it has seemed good that henceforth nothing of the kind shall in any way
occur. And we say this, not to abolish and overthrow what things were established of old
by Apostolic authority, but as caring for the health of the people and their advance to better
things, and lest the ecclesiastical state should suffer any reproach. For the divine Apostle
says: “Do all to the glory of God, give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Greeks,
nor to the Church of God, even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit
but the profit of many, that they may be saved. Be ye imitators of me even as I also am of
Christ.” But if any shall have been observed to do such a thing, let him be deposed.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</p>
<p>Although it has been decreed that wives are not to be cast forth, nevertheless that we may
counsel for the better, we give command that no one ordained a bishop shall any longer live
with his wife.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>The fifth Apostolic canon allows neither bishop, presbyter, nor deacon to cast forth his
wife under pretext of piety; and assigns penalties for any that shall do so, and if he will not
amend he is to be deposed. But this canon on the other hand does not permit a bishop even
to live with his wife after his consecration. But by this change no contempt is meant to be
poured out upon what had been established by Apostolic authority, but it was made through
care for the people’s health and for leading on to better things, and for fear that the sacerdotal
estate might suffer some wrong.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>(In Can. vi. Apost.)</p>
<p>In the time of this canon <del>of the Apostles so called</del> not only presbyters and deacons,
but bishops also, it is clear, were allowed by Eastern custom to have their wives; and Zonaras
and Balsamon note that even until the Sixth Council, commonly called in Trullo bishops
were allowed to have their wives.</p>

<pb n="696"/>
<p>(The same on this canon.)</p>
<p>But not only do they command <del>in this canon</del> that bishops after their consecration no
longer have commerce with their own wives, but further, they prohibit them even to presume
to live with them.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>When the faith first was born and came forth into the world, the Apostles treated with
greater softness and indulgence those who embraced the truth, which as yet was not scattered
far and wide, nor did they exact from them perfection in all respects, but made great allowances
for their weakness and for the inveterate force of the customs with which they were
surrounded, both among the heathen and among the Jews. But now, when far and wide
our religion has been propagated, more strenuous efforts were made to enforce those things
which pertain to a higher and holier life, as our angelical worship increased day by day, and
to insist on by law a life of continence to those who were elevated to the episcopate, so that
not only they should abstain from their wives, but that they should have them no longer as
bed-fellows; and not only that they no longer admit them as sharers of their bed, but they
do not allow them even to stop under the same roof or in the house.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="697"/>
<head>Canon XIII.</head>
<p>Since we know it to be handed down as a rule of the Roman Church that those who are
deemed worthy to be advanced to the diaconate or presbyterate should promise no longer
to cohabit with their wives, we, preserving the ancient rule and apostolic perfection and
order, will that the lawful marriages of men who are in holy orders be from this time forward
firm, by no means dissolving their union with their wives nor depriving them of their mutual
intercourse at a convenient time. Wherefore, if anyone shall have been found worthy
to be ordained subdeacon, or deacon, or presbyter, he is by no means to be prohibited from
admittance to such a rank, even if he shall live with a lawful wife. Nor shall it be demanded
of him at the time of his ordination that he promise to abstain from lawful intercourse with
his wife: lest we should affect injuriously marriage constituted by God and blessed by his
presence, as the Gospel saith: “What God hath joined together let no man put asunder;”
and the Apostle saith, “Marriage is honourable and the bed undefiled;” and again, “Art thou
bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed.” But we know, as they who assembled at Carthage
(with a care for the honest life of the clergy) said, that subdeacons, who handle the Holy
Mysteries, and deacons, and presbyters should abstain from their consorts according to
their own course <del>of ministration</del>. So that what has been handed down through the Apostles
and preserved by ancient custom, we too likewise maintain, knowing that there is a time
for all things and especially for fasting and prayer. For it is meet that they who assist at the
divine altar should be absolutely continent when they are handling holy things, in order
that they may be able to obtain from God what they ask in sincerity.</p>
<p>If therefore anyone shall have dared, contrary to the Apostolic Canons, to deprive any
of those who are in holy orders, presbyter, or deacon, or subdeacon of cohabitation and intercourse
with his lawful wife, let him be deposed. In like manner also if any presbyter or
deacon on pretence of piety has dismissed his wife, let him be excluded from communion;
and if he persevere in this let him be deposed.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</p>
<p>Although the Romans wish that everyone ordained deacon or presbyter should put away
his wife, we wish the marriages of deacons and presbyters to continue valid and firm.</p>
<p>Fleury.</p>
<p>(H. E., Livre XL., chap. 1.)</p>
<p>What is said in this canon, that the council of Carthage orders priests to abstain from
their wives at prescribed periods, is a misunderstanding of the decree, caused either by

<pb n="698"/>
malice or by ignorance. This canon is one of those adopted by the Fifth Council of Carthage
held in the year 400, and it is decreed that subdeacons, deacons; priests, and bishops shall
abstain from their wives, following the ancient statutes, and shall be as though they had
them not. The Greek version of this canon has rendered the Latin words priora statuta by
these, idious horous, which may mean “fixed times”: for the translator read, following another
codex, propria for priora. Be this as it may, the Fathers of the Trullan council supposed
that this obliged the clergy only to continence at certain fixed times, and were not willing
to see that it included bishops as well.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Although the Latin Church does not disapprove,360 as contrary to the law of the Gospel
the discipline of the Greeks which allows the use of marriage to presbyters and deacons,
provided it was contracted before ordination; yet never has it approved this canon which
with too great zeal condemns the opposite custom, and rashly assigns great errors to the
Roman Church.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars I., Dist.
XXXI., c. xiij.</p>
<p>Antonius Augustinus in his proposed emendations of Gratian says (Lib. I. dial. de emend.
Grat. c. 8.): “This canon can in no way be received; for it is written in opposition to the
celibacy of the Latin priests, and openly is against the Roman Church.” But to me the note
which Gratian appends seems much more learned and true: “This however must be understood
as of local application; for the Eastern Church, to which the VI. Synod prescribed this
rule, did not receive a vow of chastity from the ministers of the altar.” It may be well to note
here that by the opinion of most Latin casuists the obligation to chastity among the Roman
clergy rests upon the vow and not upon any law of the Church binding thereto. This evidently
was the opinion of Gratian.</p>

<p>Let the canon of our holy God-bearing Fathers be confirmed in this particular also; that

he was thirty. In like manner let no deacon be ordained before he is twenty-five, nor a
deaconess before she is forty.</p>

Compare Canon XI. of Neocæsarea.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to note here that by the law of the Roman Communion the canonical
ages are as follows:</p>
<p>A subdeacon must have completed his twenty-first year, a deacon his twenty-second,
a priest his twenty-fourth, and a bishop his thirtieth. None of the inferior clergy can hold
a simple benefice before he has begun his fourteenth year. Ecclesiastical dignities, such as
Cathedral canonries, cannot be conferred on any who have not finished the twenty-second
year. A benefice to which is attached a cure of souls can be given only to one who is over
twenty-four, and a diocese only to one who has completed his thirtieth year. (Vide Ferraris,
Bibliotheca Prompta.)</p>
<p>In the Anglican Communion the ages are, in England, for a bishop “fully thirty years
of age,” for a priest twenty-four, and for a deacon twenty-three:361 and in the United States,
for a bishop thirty years of age, for a priest twenty-four, and for a deacon twenty-one.</p>

<head>Canon XVI.</head>
<p>Since the book of the Acts tells us that seven deacons were appointed by the Apostles,
and the synod of Neocæsarea in the canons which it put forth determined that there ought
to be canonically only seven deacons, even if the city be very large, in accordance with the
book of the Acts; we, having fitted the mind of the fathers to the Apostles’ words, find that
they spoke not of those men who ministered at the Mysteries but in the administration
which pertains to the serving of tables. For the book of the Acts reads as follows: “In those
days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring dissension
of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily
ministrations. And the Twelve called the multitude of the disciples with them and said, It
is not meet for us to leave the word of God and serve tables. Look ye out therefore, brethren,
from among you seven men of good report full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom, whom
we may appoint over this business. But we will give ourselves continually unto prayer and
unto the ministry of the word. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor,
and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the
Apostles.”</p>
<p>John Chrysostom, a Doctor of the Church, interpreting these words, proceeds thus: “It
is a remarkable fact that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and that the
Apostles were not rejected by them. But we must learn what sort of rank they had, and what
ordination they received. Was it that of deacons? But this office did not yet exist in the
churches. But was it the dispensation of a presbyter? But there was not as yet any bishop,
but only Apostles, whence I think it is clear and manifest that neither of deacons nor of
presbyters was there then the name.”363</p>
<p>But on this account therefore we also announce that the aforesaid seven deacons are
not to be understood as deacons who served at the Mysteries, according to the teaching before
set forth, but that they were those to whom a dispensation was entrusted for the common
benefit of those that were gathered together, who to us in this also were a type of philanthropy
and zeal towards those who are in need.</p>

<p>The Fathers are worthy of great praise. For having regard to the honour of the ecclesiastical
order and of each bishop, they have decreed that clergymen, who from just and valid
causes have gone forth without letters dimissory from those who ordained them, should
return to their own clergy soon as the cause which drove them forth ceases; and that they
should not be enrolled on the clergy list of any other church. But whosoever cannot be
persuaded to return is to be cut off, as well as the bishop who detains him. But someone
will say, If a bishop who does such a thing is cut off by his Metropolitan; and likewise if a
Metropolitan spurns this canon he is punished by the Patriarch. But if an autocephalous
archbishop or a Patriarch other than the Patriarch of Constantinople (for he has a faculty
for doing so) should be convicted of a breach of this Canon, by whom would he be cut off?

<p>How great an obligation of preaching rests upon bishops, the successors of the Apostles,
is evident from the words of St. Paul, “Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach” (1 Cor.

<p>Cardinal Bona says (De Rob. Liturg., Lib. II., cap. xiv.), that immediately before the
words Semper bona creas, sanctificas, etc., if new fruits or any other things adapted to human
use were to be blessed, they were wont in former times to be placed before the altar, and
there to be blessed by the priest; and when the benediction was ended with the accustomed
words “Through Christ our Lord,” there was added the following prayer: “Perquem hæc
omnia, etc.,” which words are not so much to be referred to the body and blood of Christ,
as to the things to be blessed, which God continually creates by renewing, and we ask that
they may be sanctified by his benediction to our use.</p>
<p>But in after ages when the fervour of the faithful had grown cold, that the mass might
not be too long, they were separated and yet the prayer remained which, as said to-day over

places useful to the Church, even the holy Fathers themselves made use of this dispensation.
But since nothing leads us to abandon exact observance, we decree that the Apostolic and
Patristic tradition shall be followed; and define that it is not right to break the fast on the

<p>I do not think that this explanation of Fleury’s can be sustained, and it would seem that
Van Espen is more near the truth when he says: “Some priests in barbarous countries
thought they should abstain after the Latin custom even from wives taken before ordination.
And although this was contrary to the discipline of the Greeks, and also to Canon V. of the
Apostles, nevertheless the Fathers thought it might be tolerated, provided such priests should
also not live any longer with their wives.” There seems no reason to introduce anti-Roman

<head>Canon XXXII.</head>
<p>Since it has come to our knowledge that in the region of Armenia they offer wine only
on the Holy Table, those who celebrate the unbloody sacrifice not mixing water with it,
adducing, as authority thereof, John Chrysostom, a doctor of the Church, who says in his
interpretation of the Gospel according to St. Matthew:</p>
<p>“And wherefore did he not drink water after he was risen again, but wine? To pluck up
by the roots another wicked heresy. For since there are certain who use water in the Mysteries
to shew that both when he delivered the mysteries he had given wine and that when
he had risen and was setting before them a mere meal without mysteries, he used wine, ‘of
the fruit,’ saith he, ‘of the vine.’ But a vine produces wine, not water.”369 And from this
they think the doctor overthrows the admixture of water in the holy sacrifice. Now, lest on
the point from this time forward they be held in ignorance, we open out the orthodox
opinion of the Father. For since there was an ancient and wicked heresy of the Hydroparastatæ
(i.e., of those who offered water), who instead of wine used water in their sacrifice,
this divine, confuting the detestable teaching of such a heresy, and showing that it is directly
opposed to Apostolic tradition, asserted that which has just been quoted. For to his own
church, where the pastoral administration had been given him, he ordered that water mixed
with wine should be used at the unbloody sacrifice, so as to shew forth the mingling of the
blood and water which for the life of the whole world and for the redemption of its sins,
was poured forth from the precious side of Christ our Redeemer; and moreover in every
church where spiritual light has shined this divinely given order is observed.</p>
<p>For also James, the brother, according to the flesh, of Christ our God, to whom the
throne of the church of Jerusalem first was entrusted, and Basil, the Archbishop of the
Church of Cæsarea, whose glory has spread through all the world, when they delivered to
us directions for the mystical sacrifice in writing, declared that the holy chalice is consecrated
in the Divine Liturgy with water and wine. And the holy Fathers who assembled at Carthage
provided in these express terms: “That in the holy Mysteries nothing besides the body and
blood of the Lord be offered, as the Lord himself laid down, that is bread and wine mixed
with water.” Therefore if any bishop or presbyter shall not perform the holy action according
to what has been handed down by the Apostles, and shall not offer the sacrifice with wine
mixed with water, let him be deposed, as imperfectly shewing forth the mystery and innovating
on the things which have been handed down.</p>

<p>Chrysostom, when overthrowing the heresy of the Hydroparastatæ, says: “When the Lord
suffered and rose again he used wine.” The Armenians, laying hold on this, offer wine alone,
not understanding that Chrysostom himself, and Basil, and James used wine mixed with water;
and left the tradition that we should so make the offering. If, therefore, any one shall offer
wine alone, or water alone, and not the mixed <del>chalice</del> let him be deposed.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Justin Martyr in his Second Apology, Ambrose, or whoever was the author of the books
on the Sacraments (Lib. v., cap. i.), Augustine and many others make mention of this rite,
and above all St. Cyprian, who wrote a long epistle on the subject to Cecilius, and seeking
the reason of the ceremony as a setting forth of the union of the people, represented by the
water, with Christ, figured by the wine.</p>
<p>Another signification of this rite St. Augustine indicates in his sermon to Neophytes,
saying: “Take this in bread, which hung upon the Cross: Take this in the cup which poured
forth from the side,” that is to say blood and water.</p>
<p>Cardinal Bona (De Rebus Liturgicis, Lib. II., cap. ix., n. 3 and 4) refers to many ancient
rituals in which a similar prayer is used to that found in the Ambrosian rite, which says as
the water is poured in: “Out of the side of Christ there flowed forth blood and water together.
In the name of the Father, etc.” Bona further notes that “The Greeks twice mingle water
with the wine, once cold water, when in the prothesis they are preparing the Holy Gifts, and
the Priest pierces the bread with the holy spear, and says, “One of the soldiers with a lance
opened his side, and immediately there flowed forth blood and water,” and the deacon pours
in wine and water. From this it is evident that the Greeks agree with St. Augustine’s explanation.</p>
<p>For the second time the Greeks mix “hot water after consecration and immediately before
communion, the deacon begging from the priest a blessing upon the warm water; and he
blesses it in these words: ‘Blessed be the fervour of thy Saints, now and ever and to the ages
of ages. Amen.’ Then the deacon pours the water into the chalice, saying: ‘The fervour of
faith, full of the Holy Spirit.’” So Cardinal Bona as above.</p>
<p>The third reason of this rite is assumed by some from the fact that Christ is believed
thus to have instituted this sacrament at the last supper; and this the synod seems to intimate
in the present canon when it says “as the Lord himself delivered.”</p>
<p>In this case the Greeks suppose that this rite was also handed down by the Apostles,
and this is evident from their citing the Liturgy of St. James, which they believed to be a
genuine work of his.</p>

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXVII.</p>
<p>A bishop who, on account of the incursions of the barbarians, is not set in his throne, shall
have his own chair of state, and shall ordain, and shall enjoy most firmly all the rights of the
priesthood.</p>
<p>By Canon XVIII. of Antioch the principle of this canon was enunciated, that when a
bishop did not take possession of his see because he could not do so, he was not to be held
responsible or to lose any of his episcopal rights and powers, in that case the impossibility
arose from the insubordination of the people, in this from the diocese being in the hands
of the barbarians.</p>

in the state of things calling for this canon.</p>

<head>Canon XXXIX.</head>
<p>Since our brother and fellow-worker, John, bishop of the island of Cyprus, together
with his people in the province of the Hellespont, both on account of barbarian incursions,
and that they may be freed from servitude of the heathen, and may be subject alone to the
sceptres of most Christian rule, have emigrated from the said island, by the providence of
the philanthropic God, and the labour of our Christ-loving and pious Empress; we determine
that the privileges which were conceded by the divine fathers who first at Ephesus assembled,
are to be preserved without any innovations, viz.: that new Justinianopolis shall have the
rights of Constantinople and whoever is constituted the pious and most religious bishop
thereof shall take precedence of all the bishops of the province of the Hellespont, and be
elected <del>?</del> by his own bishops according to ancient custom. For the customs which obtain
in each church our divine Fathers also took pains should be maintained, the existing bishop
of the city of Cyzicus being subject to the metropolitan of the aforesaid Justinianopolis, for
the imitation of all the rest of the bishops who are under the aforesaid beloved of God metropolitan
John, by whom, as custom demands, even the bishop of the very city of Cyzicus
shall be ordained.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXIX.</p>
<p>The new Justinianopolis shall have the rights of Constantinople, and its prelate shall rule
over all the bishops of the Hellespont to whom he has gone, and he shall be ordained by his
own bishop: as the fathers of Ephesus decreed.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Hitherto the bishop of Cyzicus was metropolitan of the province of the Hellespont.
Now he too is to be subject to the bishop of New-Justinianopolis. What, however, is meant
by “the right of Constantinople”? It was impossible that the Synod should place the bishop
of Justinianopolis in equal dignity with the patriarch of Constantinople. But they probably
meant to say: “The rights which the bishop of Constantinople has hitherto exercised over
the province of the Hellespont, as chief metropolitan, fall now to the bishop of New-
Justinianopolis.” Or perhaps we should read, instead of Constantinople Κωνσταντινέων
πόλεως, as the Amerbachian ms. has it, and translate: “The same rights which Constantia
(the metropolis of Cyprus) possessed, New Justinianopolis shall henceforth have.” The
latter is the more probable.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>

<p>To understand this canon it must be remembered that the Metropolis of Cyprus, which
was formerly called Constantia, when restored by the Emperor Justinian was called by his
name, New Justinianopolis.</p>

<head>Canon XL.</head>
<p>Since to cleave to God by retiring from the noise and turmoil of life is very beneficial,
it behoves us not without examination to admit before the proper time those who choose
the monastic life, but to observe respecting them the limit handed down by our fathers, in
order that we may then admit a profession of the life according to God as for ever firm, and
the result of knowledge and judgment after years of discretion have been reached. He
therefore who is about to submit to the yoke of monastic life should not be less than ten
years of age, the examination of the matter depending on the decision of the bishop,
whether he considers a longer time more conducive for his entrance and establishment in
the monastic life. For although the great Basil in his holy canons decreed that she who
willingly offers to God and embraces virginity, if she has completed her seventeenth year,
is to be entered in the order of virgins: nevertheless, having followed the example respecting
widows and deaconesses, analogy and proportion being considered, we have admitted at
the said time those who have chosen the monastic life. For it is written in the divine Apostle
that a widow is to be elected in the church at sixty years old: but the sacred canons have
decreed that a deaconess shall be ordained at forty, since they saw that the Church by divine
grace had gone forth more powerful and robust and was advancing still further, and they
saw the firmness and stability of the faithful in observing the divine commandments.
Wherefore we also, since we most rightly comprehend the matter, appoint the benediction
of grace to him who is about to enter the struggle according to God, even as impressing
speedily a certain seal upon him, hereupon introducing him to the not-long-to-be-hesitatedover
and declined, or rather inciting him even to the choice and determination of good.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XL.</p>
<p>A monk must be ten years old. Even if the Divine Basil thought the one shorn should be
over seventeen. But although the Apostle ordains that a widow to be espoused to the Church
must be sixty, yet the Fathers say a Deaconess is to be ordained at forty, the Church in the
meanwhile having become stronger; so we place the seal on a monk at an earlier age.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>The eighteenth canon of Basil the Great orders that she who offers herself to the Lord
and renounces marriage, ought to be over sixteen or even seventeen years of age: so that
her promise may be firm and that if she violates it she may suffer the due penalties. For,
says he, children’s voices are not to be thought of any value in such matters. But the present
canon admits him who is not less than ten years and desires to be a monk, but entrusts the

<pb n="731"/>
determination of the exact time to the judgment of the hegumenos, whether he thinks it
more advantageous to increase the age-requirement for the entering and being established
in the married life. But the canon lessens the time defined by Basil the Great, because the
Fathers thought that the Church by divine grace had grown stronger since then, and was
going on more and more, and that the faithful seemed firmer and more stable for the observance
of the divine commandments. And for the same reason, viz., that the Church was
growing better, the sacred canons had lessened the age of deaconesses, and fixed it at forty
years, although the Apostle himself orders that no widow is to be chosen into the Church
under sixty years of age.</p>

<head>Canon XLI.</head>
<p>Those who in town or in villages wish to go away into cloisters, and take heed for
themselves apart, before they enter a monastery and practise the anchorite’s life,370 should
for the space of three years in the fear of God submit to the Superior of the house, and fulfil
obedience in all things, as is right, thus shewing forth their choice of this life and that they
embrace it willingly and with their whole hearts; they are then to be examined by the superior
(προέδρος) of the place; and then to bear bravely outside the cloister one year more, so
that their purpose may be fully manifested. For by this they will shew fully and perfectly
that they are not catching at vain glory, but that they are pursuing the life of solitude because
of its inherent beauty and honour. After the completion of such a period, if they remain in
the same intention in their choice of the life, they are to be enclosed, and no longer is it
lawful for them to go out of such a house when they so desire, unless they be induced to do
so for the common advantage, or other pressing necessity urging on to death; and then only
with the blessing of the bishop of that place.</p>
<p>And those who, without the above-mentioned causes, venture forth of their convents,
are first of all to be shut up in the said convent even against their wills, and then are to cure
themselves with fasting and other afflictions, knowing how it is written that “no one who
has put his hand to the plough and has looked back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLI.</p>
<p>Whoever is about to enter a cloister, let him live for three years in a monastery, and before

<p>This canon, so far as it sets forth the necessity of probation before admission to the
Anchorite life, synods in after-years frequently approved, taught as they were by experience
how perilous a matter it is to admit without sufficient probation to this solitary life and state
of separation from the common intercourse with his fellow men. Vide the Synod of Vannes

God our Saviour says: “Whose cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.”</p>

<p>The greatness or the number of a man’s sins ought not to make him lose hope of propitiating
the divinity by his penitence, if he turns his eyes to the divine mercy. This is what
the canon asserts, and affirms that everyone, no matter how wicked and nefarious his life
may have been, may embrace monastic discipline, which inscribes, as on a tablet,373 to us
a life of penitence. For as a tablet describes to us what is inscribed upon it, so the monastic

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIV.</p>
<p>A monk joined in marriage or committing fornication shall pay the penalty of a fornicator.</p>
<p>The punishment here seems too light, so that Balsamon thinks that this canon only
refers to such monks as freely confess their sin and desist from it, remaining in their monasteries;
and that the sterner penalties assigned to unchaste religious by other synods (notably
Chalcedon, can. xvj., and Ancyra, can. xix.) are for such as do not confess their faults but
are after some time convicted of them.</p>

<p>The monk will receive the same punishment whether he be a fornicator or has joined
himself with a woman for the communion of marriage.</p>

<p>It is very likely from this canon that the Monastic vow at the time of this Synod was not

the present canon says without discrimination, that those who give themselves over to such
things if clergymen are to be deposed, and if laymen to be cut off. The solution is this. It
is one thing and more easily to be endured, that a man should be present at a horse-race,
or be convicted of going to see a play; and another thing, and one that cannot be pardoned,
that he should give himself over to such things, and to exercise this continually as his business.
Wherefore those who have once sinned deliberately, are admonished to cease. If they

<head>Canon LII.</head>
<p>On all days of the holy fast of Lent, except on the Sabbath, the Lord’s day and the holy
day of the Annunciation, the Liturgy of the Presanctified is to be said.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LII.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of Lent except upon the Lord’s day, the Sabbath, and upon the day
of the Annunciation, the presanctified gifts shall be offered.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>We do not call the service of the Presanctified the unbloody sacrifice, but the offering
of the previously offered, and of the perfected sacrifice, and of the completed priestly act.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The Greeks therefore confess that the bread once offered and consecrated, is not to be
consecrated anew on another day; but a new offering is made of what was before consecrated
and presanctified: just as in the Latin Church the consecrated or presanctified bread of
Maundy Thursday is offered on Good Friday.</p>
<p>The Patriarch Michael of Constantinople is quoted by Leo Allatius as saying that “none
of the mystic consecratory prayers are said over the presanctified gifts, but the priest only
recites the prayer that he may be a worthy communicant.”</p>
<p>Some among the later Greeks have been of opinion that the unconsecrated wine was
consecrated by the commixture with the consecrated bread, and (without any words of
consecration) was transmuted into the sacred blood,374 and with this seems to agree the
already quoted Michael, Patriarch of Constantinople, who is cited by Leo Allatius in his
treatise on the rite of the presanctified. “The presanctified is put into the mystic chalice,
and so the wine which was then in it, is changed into the holy blood of the Lord.” And with
this agrees Simeon, Archbishop of Thessalonica, in his answer to Gabriel of Pentapolis,
when he writes: “In the mass of the Presanctified no consecration of what is in the chalice
is made by the invocation of the Holy Spirit and of his sign, but by the participation and
union of the life-giving bread, which is truly the body of Christ.”</p>
<p>From this opinion, which was held by some of the Greeks, it gradually became the
practice at Constantinople not to dip the bread in the Sacred Blood, as Michael the patriarch
<note type="footnote">374 Gerbert makes it quite evident that from about 850 until 1200, that is from Amalarius until Durand, the
same view was held in the West. Vide Gerbertus. Vetus Liturgia Allomanica, p. 855 et. seqq.</note>

<pb n="744"/>
of this very church testifies. But in the ordinary Euchologion of the Greeks it is expressly
set forth that the presanctified bread before it is reserved, should be dipped in the sacred
blood, and for this a rite is provided.</p>
<p>Leo Allatius’s Dissertatio de Missa Præsanctificatorum should be read; an outline of the
service as found in the Euchologion, and as reprinted by Renaudotius is as follows.</p>
<p>First of all vespers is said. After some lessons and prayers, including the “Great Ectenia”
and that for the Catechumens, these are dismissed.</p>
<p>After the Catechumens have departed there follows the Ectenia of the Faithful. After
which, “Now the heavenly Powers invisibly minister with us; for, behold, the King of Glory
is borne in. Behold the mystic sacrifice having been perfected is borne aloft by angels.</p>
<p>“Let us draw near with faith and love, that we may become partakers of life eternal.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.</p>
<p>“Deacon. Let us accomplish our evening prayer to the Lord.</p>
<p>“For the precious and presanctified gifts that are offered, let us pray to the Lord. “That
our man-loving God, etc.” as in the ordinary liturgy past the Lord’s prayer, and down to the
Sancta Sanctis, which reads as follows:</p>
<p>Priest. Holy things presanctified for holy persons.</p>
<p>Choir. One holy, one Lord Jesus Christ, to the Glory of God the Father—Amen.</p>
<p>Then the Communion Hymn and the Communion, and the rest as in the ordinary
liturgy, except “this whole evening,” is said for “this whole day,” and another prayer is
provided in the room of that beginning “Lord, who blessest them, etc.”375</p>
<p>It is curious to note that on Good Friday, the only day on which the Mass of the Presanctified
is celebrated in the West, its use has died out in the East, and now it is used “on
the Wednesdays and Fridays of the first six weeks of the Great Quadragesima, on the
Thursday of the fifth week, and on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Holy Passion
Week. It may also be said, excepting on Saturdays and Sundays, and on the Festival of the
Annunciation, on other days during the Fast, to wit, on those of festivals and their Vigils,
and on the Commemoration of the Dedication of the Church.”</p>
<p>Symeon, who was bishop of Thessalonica, and flourished in the early part of the XVth
Century, complains of the general neglect of the Mass of the Presanctified on Good Friday
in his time, and says that his church was the only one in the Exarchate that then retained
it. He ascribes the disuse to the example of the Church of Jerusalem. See the matter treated
at length in his Quæstiones, lv.–lix. Migne’s Pat. Græc.</p>

<head>Canon LIII.</head>
<p>Whereas the spiritual relationship is greater than fleshly affinity; and since it has come
to our knowledge that in some places certain persons who become sponsors to children in
holy salvation-bearing baptism, afterwards contract matrimony with their mothers (being
widows), we decree that for the future nothing of this sort is to be done. But if any, after
the present canon, shall be observed to do this, they must, in the first place, desist from this
unlawful marriage, and then be subjected to the penalties of fornicators.</p>

<p>(Clergyman’s Vade Mecum.)</p>
<p>The imperial law forbade the adopter parent to marry his or her adopted son or
daughter; for the godchild was thought a sort of an adopted child. See Justin., Institut., Lib.
I., Tit. x.</p>
<p>Van Espen however refers, and to my mind with greater truth, to Justinian’s law (xxvj
of the Cod. de Nuptiis) which forbids the marriage of a man with his nurse or with whoever
received him from the font, “because,” says the law, “nothing can so incite to parental affection,
and therefore induce a just prohibition of marriage, than a bond of this sort by which,
through God’s meditation, their souls are bound together.”</p>

<head>Canon LIV.</head>
<p>The divine scriptures plainly teach us as follows, “Thou shalt not approach to any that
is near of kin to thee to uncover their nakedness.” Basil, the bearer-of-God, has enumerated
in his canons some marriages which are prohibited and has passed over the greater part in
silence, and in both these ways has done us good service. For by avoiding a number of disgraceful
names (lest by such words he should pollute his discourse) he included impurities
under general terms, by which course he shewed to us in a general way the marriages which
are forbidden. But since by such silence, and because of the difficulty of understanding
what marriages are prohibited, the matter has become confused; it seemed good to us to set
it forth a little more clearly, decreeing that from this time forth he who shall marry with the
daughter of his father; or a father or son with a mother and daughter; or a father and son
with two girls who are sisters; or a mother and daughter with two brothers; or two brothers
with two sisters, fall under the canon of seven years, provided they openly separate from
this unlawful union.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LIV.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not permit the marriage of a son of a brother to the daughter of a brother; nor
with a daughter and her mother shall there be the marriage of a son and his father; neither a
mother and a daughter with two brothers; nor brothers with two sisters. But should anything
of this sort have been done, together with separation, penance shall be done for seven years.</p>

<head>Canon LV.</head>
<p>Since we understand that in the city of the Romans, in the holy fast of Lent they fast on
the Saturdays, contrary to the ecclesiastical observance which is traditional, it seemed good
to the holy synod that also in the Church of the Romans the canon shall immovably stands
fast which says: “If any cleric shall be found to fast on a Sunday or Saturday (except on one
occasion only) he is to be deposed; and if he is a layman he shall be cut off.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LV.</p>
<p>The Romans fast the Sabbaths of Lent. Therefore this Synod admonishes that upon these
days the Apostolical canon is of force.</p>
<p>The canon quoted is LXVI. of the Apostolic Canons.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The Fathers of this Synod thought that this canon of the Apostles was edited by the
Apostles themselves, and therefore they seem to have reprobated the custom of the Roman
Church of fasting on the Sabbath more bitterly than was right. Whence it happens this is
one of those canons which the Roman Church never received.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>The synod took in hand to correct this failing (σφάλμα) of the Latins; but until this time
they have arrogantly remained in their pertinacity, and so remain to-day. Nor do they heed
the ancient canons which forbid fasting on the Sabbath except that one, to wit the great
Sabbath, nor are they affected by the authority of this canon. Moreover the clerics have no
regard for the threatened deposition, nor the laymen for their being cut off.</p>

<p>We have likewise learned that in the regions of Armenia and in other places certain
people eat eggs and cheese on the Sabbaths and Lord’s days of the holy lent. It seems good
therefore that the whole Church of God which is in all the world should follow one rule and
keep the fast perfectly, and as they abstain from everything which is killed, so also should
they from eggs and cheese, which are the fruit and produce of those animals from which
we abstain. But if any shall not observe this law, if they be clerics, let them be deposed; but
if laymen, let them be cut off.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>

<p>Armenians eat eggs and cheese on the Sabbaths in Lent. It is determined that the whole

<p>This canon shows that the ancient Greeks, although they did not fast on the Sabbaths
and Lord’s days of Lent, nevertheless they abstained on them from flesh food; and it was
believed by them that abstinence from flesh food involved also necessarily abstinence from
all those things which have their origin from flesh. This also formerly was observed by the
Latins in Lent, and in certain regions is known still to be the usage.</p>

<p>It is well known that in the first centuries it was customary that the Holy Eucharist

ministering with alacrity, we shall not all be the tongue which is the more active member,
not all of us Apostles, not all prophets, nor shall we all interpret.” And again: “Why dost
thou make thyself a shepherd when thou art a sheep? Why become the head when thou art

<p>No layman except the Emperor shall go up to the altar.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>That in the Latin Church as well as in the Greek for many centuries it was the constant
custom, ratified by various councils, that lay-men are to be excluded from the sanctuary
and from the place marked off for the priests who are celebrating the divine mysteries, is so
notorious as to need no proof, and the present canon shows that among the Greeks the laity
were not admitted to the sacrarium even to make offerings.</p>
<p>The Synod makes but one exception, to wit, the Emperor, who can enter the rails of the
holy altar by its permission “when he wishes to offer his gifts to the Creator, according to
ancient custom.”</p>
<p>Not without foundation does the Synod claim “ancient custom” for this; for long before,
it is evident, it was the case from the words of the Emperor Theodosius the Younger. See
also Theodoret (H. E., lib. v., cap. xvij.).</p>
<p>In the Latin Church, not only to emperors, kings, and great princes but also to patrons
of churches, to toparchs of places, and even to magistrates, seats have been wont to be assigned
honoris causâ within the sanctuary or choir, and it has been contended that these are
properly due to such persons.</p>
<p>It is evident from Balsamon’s note that the later Greeks at least looked upon the Emperor
as being (like the kings of England and France) a persona mixta, sharing in some degree the
sacerdotal character, as being anointed not merely with oil, but with the sacred chrism.

<p>Perhaps none of the canons of this synod present greater and more insolvable difficulties
than the present. It has been for long centuries the tradition of the Church that the marriage
of a baptized Christian with an unbaptized person is null, but this canon seems to say that
the same is the case if the one party be a heretic even though baptized. If this is what the
canon means it elevates heresy into an impedimentum dirimens. Such is not and never has
been the law of the West, and such is not to-day the practice of the Eastern church, which
allows the marriage of its people with Lutherans and with Roman Catholics and never
questions the validity of their marriages. Van Espen thinks “the Greek commentators seem”
to think that the heretics referred to are unbaptized; I do not know exactly why he thinks

<p>Since the life-giving cross has shewn to us Salvation, we should be careful that we render
due honour to that by which we were saved from the ancient fall. Wherefore, in mind, in
word, in feeling giving veneration (προσκύνησιν) to it, we command that the figure of the
cross, which some have placed on the floor, be entirely removed therefrom, lest the trophy
of the victory won for us be desecrated by the trampling under foot of those who walk over
it. Therefore those who from this present represent on the pavement the sign of the cross,
we decree are to be cut off.</p>

<p>We will that those whose office it is to sing in the churches do not use undisciplined
vociferations, nor force nature to shouting, nor adopt any of those modes which are incongruous
and unsuitable for the church: but that they offer the psalmody to God, who is the
observer of secrets, with great attention and compunction. For the Sacred Oracle taught
that the Sons of Israel were to be pious.382</p>

<p>Inordinate vociferation of the psalms is not allowed, nor he that adopts things unsuited

<p>This question of the character of church-music was one early discussed among Christians,
and (long before the time of this synod), St. Augustine, in debating as to whether the
chanting or the reading of the psalter was the more edifying, concludes, “when the psalms
are chanted with a voice and most suitable modulation (liquida voce et convenientissima
modulatione), I recognize that there is great utility in the practice,” and further on he adds
that singing is to be the rather approved, because “by the delight given to the ears the infirm
soul is worked up to pious aspirations.” (Confess. Lib. x., cap. xxxiij.).</p>

<p>Canon LXXIX.</p>
<p>As we confess the divine birth of the Virgin to be without any childbed, since it came
to pass without seed, and as we preach this to the entire flock, so we subject to correction
those who through ignorance do anything which is inconsistent therewith. Wherefore since
some on the day after the holy Nativity of Christ our God are seen cooking σεμίδαλῖν , and
distributing it to each other, on pretext of doing honour to the puerperia of the spotless
Virgin Maternity, we decree that henceforth nothing of the kind be done by the faithful.
For this is not honouring the Virgin (who above thought and speech bare in the flesh the
incomprehensible Word) when we define384 and describe, from ordinary things and from
such as occur with ourselves, her ineffable parturition. If therefore anyone henceforth be
discovered doing any such thing, if he be a cleric let him be deposed, but if a layman let him
be cut off.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXIX.</p>
<p>Whoever after the feast of the Mother of God shall prepare σεμίδιλιν (semilam) or anything
else on account of what is called puerperia, let him be cut off.</p>
<p>As the Catholic Church has always taught the Virgin-birth as well as the Virgin-conception
of our Blessed Lord, and has affirmed that Mary was ever-virgin, even after she had
brought forth the incarnate Son, so it follows necessarily that there could be no childbed
nor puerperal flux. It need hardly be remarked here that besides other texts that of the
prophet is considered as teaching thus much, “Behold the Virgin (ha alma) shall conceive
and bear a son,” she that “bare” as well as she that “conceived” being a virgin. Some commentators
have taken ἐπιλόχεια for the afterbirth, but Christian Lupus, as Van Espen notes,
has pointed out that the early fathers seem to have recognized that the Virgin did have the
“afterbirth,” and this St. Jerome expressly teaches in his book, Contra Helvidium.</p>
<p>The Greeks, however, understood it as I have translated, and the witness of Zonaras
will be sufficient. The words λοχος, λοχαιος and the like all signify “lying in,” “a place of
lying in,” and Liddell and Scott say that the latter word is used of “bearing down like heavy
ears of corn,” which would well express the labour pains.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>This canon teaches that the parturition of the holy Virgin was without any childbed.
For childbed (puerperium) is the emission of the foetus accompanied by pain and a flux of

blood: but none of us ever believed that the Mother of God was subjected to sufferings of
this sort, for these are the consequents of natural conception, but her conception was supernatural;
and by the Holy Spirit it was brought to pass that she was not subjected to those
evils which rightly are attached to natural parturition.</p>

<head>Canon LXXXI.</head>
<p>Whereas we have heard that in some places in the hymn Trisagion there is added after
“Holy and Immortal,” “Who was crucified for us, have mercy upon us,” and since this as
being alien to piety was by the ancient and holy Fathers cast out of the hymn, as also the
violent heretics who inserted these new words were cast out of the Church; we also, confirming
the things which were formerly piously established by our holy Fathers, anathematize
those who after this present decree allow in church this or any other addition to the most
sacred hymn; but if indeed he who has transgressed is of the sacerdotal order, we command
that he be deprived of his priestly dignity, but if he be a layman or monk let him be cut off.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXI.</p>
<p>Whoever adds to the hymn Trisagion these words “Who wast crucified” shall be deemed
heterodox.</p>
<p>The addition of the phrase condemned by this canon was probably made first by Peter
Fullo, and although indeed it was capable of a good meaning, if the whole hymn was understood
as being addressed to Christ, and although this was admitted by very many of the orthodox,
yet as it was chiefly used by the Monophysites and with an undoubtedly heretical
intention, it was finally ousted from this position and its adherents were styled Theopaschites.
From all this it came about that by 518 it was a source of disagreement among the Catholics,
some affirming the expression, as looked at by itself, to be a touchstone of orthodoxy. The
Emperor Justinian tried to have it approved by Pope Hormisdas, but unsuccessfully, the
pontiff only declaring that it was unnecessary, and even dangerous. Fulgentius of Ruspe
and Dionysius Exiguus had declared it orthodox. Pope John II. almost came to the point
of approving the phrase “one of the Trinity suffered,” nor did his successor Agapetus I.
speak any more definitely on the point, but the Fifth Ecumenical Council directly approved
the formula.</p>
<p>But this, of course, did not touch the point of its introduction into the Trisagion or,
more accurately, of the introduction of the words “who was crucified for us.”</p>
<p>It should have been noted that at a Home Synod in 478, Peter Fullo had been deposed
for the insertion of this clause, because he intended to imply that the true God had suffered
death upon the cross. This sentence was a confirmation of one already pronounced against
him by a synod held at Antioch which had raised a man, Stephen by name, to its episcopal
throne.</p>

<p>Such is the history of a matter which, while it seemed at first as of little moment, yet for
many years was a source of trouble in the Church. (Vide Hefele, History of the Councils,

<p>In some pictures of the venerable icons, a lamb is painted to which the Precursor points
his finger, which is received as a type of grace, indicating beforehand through the Law, our
true Lamb, Christ our God. Embracing therefore the ancient types and shadows as symbols
of the truth, and patterns given to the Church, we prefer “grace and truth,” receiving it as
the fulfilment of the Law. In order therefore that “that which is perfect” may be delineated
to the eyes of all, at least in coloured expression, we decree that the figure in human form
of the Lamb who taketh away the sin of the world, Christ our God, be henceforth exhibited
in images, instead of the ancient lamb, so that all may understand by means of it the depths
of the humiliation of the Word of God, and that we may recall to our memory his conversation
in the flesh, his passion and salutary death, and his redemption which was wrought for
the whole world.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXII.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not paint a lamb for the type of Christ, but himself.</p>
<p>As from this canon, a century earlier than the iconoclastic controversy, the prevalence
of pictures is evident, so from the canon of the same synod with regard to the veneration
due to the image of the cross (number lxxiii.), we learn that the teaching of the Church with
regard to relative worship was the same as was subsequently set forth, so that the charge of
innovating, sometimes rashly brought against the Seventh Ecumenical Council, has no
foundation in fact whatever.</p>

<p>Compare with this Canon vij. of Laodicea, and the so-called vijth. canon of the First
Council of Constantinople.</p>
<p>The text I have translated is that ordinarily given, I now present to the reader Hefele’s
argument for its worthlessness.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>

<pb n="790"/>
<p>This text is undoubtedly false, for (a) the baptism of the Gnostics was, according to the
recognized ecclesiastical principle, invalid, and a Gnostic coming into the Church was required
to be baptized anew; (b) besides, it would have us first to require of a Gnostic an
anathema on Nestorius, Eutyches, etc. More accurate, therefore, is the text, as it is given by
Beveridge, and as Balsamon had it, to the effect that: “In the same way (as the preceding)
are the Manichæans, Valentinians, Marcionites, and similar heretics to be treated (i.e., to
be baptized anew); but the Nestorians must (merely) present certificates, and anathematize
their heresy, Nestorius, Eutyches, etc.” Here we have only this mistake, that the Nestorians
must anathematize, among others, also Eutyches, which they would certainly have done
very willingly. At the best, we must suppose that there is a gap in the text, and that after,
“all of similar heresies,” we must add “the later heretics must present certificates and anathematize
Nestorius, Eutyches, etc.”</p>
<p>There seems but little doubt that whatever may be the truth in the matter, the early
theologians and fathers held that even though the external rite of Holy Baptism might be
validly performed by schismatics and heretics, yet that by it the person so baptized did not
receive the Holy Ghost, and this opinion was not confined to the East, but was also prevalent
in the West. Vide Rupertus, De Divinis Officiis, Lib. X., Cap. xxv.</p>

<p>Those who by baptism have put on Christ have professed that they will copy his manner
of life which he led in the flesh. Those therefore who adorn and arrange their hair to the
detriment of those who see them, that is by cunningly devised intertwinings, and by this

suitable punishment: training them and teaching them to live soberly, in order that having
laid aside the deceit and vanity of material things, they may give their minds continually to
a life which is blessed and free from mischief, and have their conversation in fear, pure, [and
holy386]; and thus come as near as possible to God through their purity of life; and adorn
the inner man rather than the outer, and that with virtues, and good and blameless manners,
so that they leave in themselves no remains of the left-handedness of the adversary. But if

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVIII.</p>
<p>He is an adulterer who takes one espoused to some one else.</p>
<p>Aristenus’s commentary on this canon is Σαφής. A more extraordinary estimate of it
could hardly be made. So far from the meaning being “perspicuous,” as the Latin translation
has it, the meaning seems to be past finding out; for, as Van Espen remarks, a man who sins
with a betrothed woman is certainly not an “adulterer.” He tries therefore to introduce the
idea that though he is not an adulterer, yet he is to be punished as if he were. But the Greek
hardly seems patient of this meaning, and the Ancient Epitome says in so many words that
he is an adulterer.</p>
<p>On account of this difficulty some have supposed that the espousals here mentioned
were not de futuro but de proesenti, and that therefore it was the case of stealing a real wife
of another man. But this explanation also is involved in many difficulties.</p>

<p>We have further learned that, in the regions of the Armenians, certain persons boil
joints of meat within the sanctuary and offer portions to the priests, distributing it after the
Jewish fashion. Wherefore, that we may keep the church undefiled, we decree that it is not
lawful for any priest to seize the separate portions of flesh meat from those who offer them,
but they are to be content with what he that offers pleases to give them; and further we decree
that such offering be made outside the church. And if any one does not thus, let him be cut

<p>There are some who like the Jews cook meat in the holy places. Whoever permits this, or

<p>The great and divine Apostle Paul with loud voice calls man created in the image of

by the saving Passion has attained to the celestial dignity, eating and drinking Christ, is fitted
in all respects for eternal life, sanctifying his soul and body by the participation of divine
grace. Wherefore, if any one wishes to be a participator of the immaculate Body in the time
of the Synaxis, and to offer himself for the communion, let him draw near, arranging his
hands in the form of a cross, and so let him receive the communion of grace. But such as,
instead of their hands, make vessels of gold or other materials for the reception of the divine
gift, and by these receive the immaculate communion, we by no means allow to come, as
preferring inanimate and inferior matter to the image of God. But if any one shall be found
imparting the immaculate Communion to those who bring vessels of this kind, let him be
cut off as well as the one who brings them.</p>

it with his mouth; whoever shall prepare a receptacle of gold or of any other material instead

<p>At first, perchance, this was invented from pious feelings, because the hand which came
in contact with base and unworthy things was not worthy to receive the Lord’s body, but,
as time went on, piety was turned to the injury of the soul, so that those who did this when
they came to receive with an arrogant and insolent bearing, were preferred to the poor.</p>

<head>Canon CII.</head>
<p>It behoves those who have received from God the power to loose and bind, to consider
the quality of the sin and the readiness of the sinner for conversion, and to apply medicine
suitable for the disease, lest if he is injudicious in each of these respects he should fail in regard
to the healing of the sick man. For the disease of sin is not simple, but various and multiform,
and it germinates many mischievous offshoots, from which much evil is diffused, and it
proceeds further until it is checked by the power of the physician. Wherefore he who professes
the science of spiritual medicine ought first of all to consider the disposition of him
who has sinned, and to see whether he tends to health or (on the contrary) provokes to
himself disease by his own behaviour, and to look how he can care for his manner of life
during the interval. And if he does not resist the physician, and if the ulcer of the soul is
increased by the application of the imposed medicaments, then let him mete out mercy to
him according as he is worthy of it. For the whole account is between God and him to whom
the pastoral rule has been delivered, to lead back the wandering sheep and to cure that which
is wounded by the serpent; and that he may neither cast them down into the precipices of
despair, nor loosen the bridle towards dissolution or contempt of life; but in some way or
other, either by means of sternness and astringency, or by greater softness and mild medicines,
to resist this sickness and exert himself for the healing of the ulcer, now examining
the fruits of his repentance and wisely managing the man who is called to higher illumination.
For we ought to know two things, to wit, the things which belong to strictness and
those which belong to custom, and to follow the traditional form in the case of those who
are not fitted for the highest things, as holy Basil teaches us.</p>

<head>Introduction on the Date of the Council.</head>
<p>(Hefele, Hist. Councils, Vol. II., pp. 86 et seqq.)</p>
<p>Our inquiries concerning the Synod of Sardica must begin with a chronological examination
of the date of this assembly. Socrates and Sozomen place it expressly in the year 347
a.d., with the more precise statement that it was held under the Consuls Rufinus and Eusebius
in the eleventh year after the death of Constantine the Great, therefore after the 22d of
May, 347, according to our way of reckoning.</p>
<p>This was the most general view until, rather more than a hundred years ago, the learned
Scipio Maffei discovered at Verona, the fragment of a Latin translation of an old Alexandrian
chronicle (the Historia Acephala), and edited it in the third volume of the Osservazioni Litterarii
in 1738. This fragment contains the information that on the 24th Phaophi (October
21), under the Consuls Constantius IV. and Constans II., in the year 346, Athanasius had
returned to Alexandria from his second exile. As it is universally allowed, however, as we
shall presently show more clearly, that this return certainly only took place about two years
after the Synod of Sardica, Mansi hence saw the necessity of dating this synod as early as
the year 344. In this he is confirmed by St. Jerome, in the continuation of the Eusebian
chronicle, who, in accordance with the Historia Acephala, has assigned the return of St.
Athanasius to the tenth year of the reign of the Emperor Constantius, in 346.</p>
<p>Many learned men now followed Mansi, the greater number blindly; others, again,
sought to contradict him, at first the learned Dominican, Mamachi; then Dr. Wetzer (Professor
at Freiburg); and latterly, we ourselves in a treatise, “Controversen über die Synode
von Sardika,” in the Tübinger Theol. Quartalschrift, 1852. Soon after there was a fresh discovery.
Some of the Paschal Letters of St. Athanasius, which until then were supposed to
be lost, were discovered in an Egyptian monastery, with a very ancient preface translated
into Syriac, and were published in that language by Cureton in London, and in the year
1852 in German by Professor Larsow, at the Grey Friars Convent, in Berlin.</p>
<p>Among these Festal Letters, the nineteenth, intended for Easter 347, and therefore
composed in the beginning of that year, had been rewritten in Alexandria, as the introduction
expressly states. This confirms the statement of the Historia Acephala, that Athanasius was
already returned to Alexandria in October, 346, and confirms the chief points of Mansi’s
hypothesis; while, on the other hand, it unanswerably refutes, by Athanasius’ own testimony,
the statements of Socrates and Sozomen (which, from their dependence on each other, only
count as one), with reference to the date 347.</p>
<p>As we said, Mansi placed this Synod in the year 344; but the old preface to the Festal
Letters of St. Athanasius dates it in the year 343, and in fact we can now only hesitate between
the dates 343 and 344. If the preface were as ancient and as powerfully convincing as the
Festal Letters themselves, then the question concerning the date of the Council of Sardica

<pb n="802"/>
would be most accurately decided. As, however, this preface contains mistakes in several
places, especially chronological errors—for instance, regarding the death of Constantine
the Great—we cannot unconditionally accept its statement as to the date 344, but can only
do so when it corresponds with other dates concerning that time.</p>
<p>Let us, at all events, assume that Athanasius came to Rome about Easter, 340. As is
known, he was there for three whole years, and in the beginning of the fourth year was
summoned to the Emperor Constans at Milan. This points to the summer of 343. From
thence he went through Gaul to Sardica, and thus it is quite possible that that Synod might
have begun in the autumn of 343. It probably lasted, however, until the spring; for when
the two envoys, Euphrates of Cologne, and Vincent of Capua, who were sent by the Synod
to the Emperor Constans, arrived in Antioch, it was already Easter 344. Stephen, the bishop
of the latter city, treated them in a truly diabolical manner; but his wickedness soon became
notorious, and a synod was established, which deposed him after Easter 344. Its members
were Eusebians, who therefore appointed Leontius Castratus as Stephen’s successor, and it
is indeed no other than this assembly which Athanasius has in mind, when he says it took
place three years after the Synod in Encæniis, and drew up a very explicit Eusebian confession
of faith, the μακρόστιχος.</p>
<p>The disgraceful behaviour of Bishop Stephen of Antioch for some time inclined the
Emperor to place less confidence in the Arian party, and to allow Athanasius’s exiled clergy
to return home in the summer of 344. Ten months later, the pseudo-bishop, Gregory of
Alexandria, died (in June, 345), and Constantius did not permit any fresh appointment to
the see of Alexandria, but recalled St. Athanasius by three letters, and waited for him more
than a year. Thus the see of Alexandria remained unoccupied for more than a year, until
the last six months of 346. At length, in October, 346, Athanasius returned to his bishopric.</p>
<p>We see then that by accepting the distinct statements of the Paschal Letters of St. Athanasius
and the preface, we obtain a satisfactory chronological system in which the separate
details cohere well together, and which thus recommends itself. One great objection which
we formerly raised ourselves against the date 344 can now be solved. It is certainly true that
in 353 or 354 Pope Librius wrote thus: “Eight years ago the Eusebian deputies, Eudoxius
and Martyrius (who came to the West with the formula μακρόστικος), refused to anathematize
the Arian doctrine at Milan.” But the Synod of Milan here alluded to, and placed about
the year 345, was not, as we before erroneously supposed, held before the Synod of Sardica,
but after it. We are somewhat less fortunate as regards another difficulty. The Eusebians
assembled at Philippopolis (the pseudo-synod of Sardica) say, in their synodal letter:
“Bishop Asclepas of Gaza was deposed from his bishopric seventeen years ago.” This deposition
occurred at an Antiochian synod. If we identified this synod with the well-known one
of 330, by which Eustathius of Antioch also was overthrown, we should, reckoning the
seventeen years, have the year 346 or 347, in which to place the writing of the Synodal Letter

<pb n="803"/>
of Philippopolis, and therefore the Synod of Sardica. There are, however, two ways of
avoiding this conclusion, either we must suppose that Asclepas has been already deposed a
year or so before the Antiochian Synod of 330; or that the statement as to the number seventeen
in the Latin translation of the Synodal Letter of Philippopolis (for we no longer
possess the original text) is an error or slip of the pen. But in no case can this Synodal Letter
alter the fact that Athanasius was again in Alexandria when he composed his Paschal Letter
for the year 347, and that the Synod of Sardica must therefore have been held several years
before.</p>

<head>Note on the Text of the Canons.</head>
<p>The Canons of Sardica have come down to us both in Greek and Latin, and some writers
such as Richer (Histoire Conc. Générale, Tom. i., p. 98), have been of opinion that the Latin
text alone was the original, while others, such as Walch (Gesch. der Kirchenvers., p. 179),
have arrived at a directly opposite conclusion. Now, however, chiefly owing to the investigations
of the Ballerini and of Spittler, the unanimous opinion of scholars—so says Hefele—is
that the canons were originally drawn up in both languages, intended as they were for both
Latins and Greeks. I may perhaps remind the reader that in many Western collections of
canons the canons of Sardica immediately follow those of Nice without any break, or note
that they were not enacted at that council. It will also be well to bear in mind that they were
received by the Greeks as of Ecumenical authority by the Council in Trullo, and as such are
contained in the body of the Greek Canon Law.</p>

for such attempts; since no bishop could ever yet be found who endeavoured to
be translated from a larger city to a smaller one. It is therefore evident that such persons
are inflamed with excessive covetousness and are only serving ambition in order to have

be punished with great severity? For I think that men of this sort should not be admitted

<p>What Peter de Marca says (De Concordia Sacerdotii et Imp., Lib. V., cap. iv.), “Hosius
presided over” this council as legate of the Roman bishop, rests upon no solid foundation,
and no trace of any such legation is found in Athanasius or in any of the other writers who
treated of this synod. Moreover such a thing is contrary to the form of subscription used.
For of those who signed the first is Hosius, and Athanasius designates him simply as “from
Spain,” without any addition; and then next he mentions “Julius of Rome, by Archidamus
and Philoxenus, his presbyters,” etc. What is clearer than that, by the testimony of Athanasius,
Julius was present by these two presbyters only, and that they only were his legates or
vicars, who in his room were present at this synod?</p>

<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: But if any such person should be found so mad or audacious as to
think to advance by way of excuse an affirmation that he had brought letters from the people
<del>laity</del>, it is plain that some few persons, corrupted by bribes and rewards, could have got
up an uproar in the church, demanding, forsooth, the said man for bishop. I think then
that practices and devices of such sort absolutely must be punished, so that a man of this
kind be deemed unworthy even of lay communion in extremis. Do ye therefore make answer
whether this sentence is approved by you. They <del>the bishops</del> answered: What has been
said is approved of.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: Even if any such person should show himself so rash as perhaps
to allege as an excuse and affirm that he has received letters from the people, inasmuch as
it is evident that a few persons could have been corrupted by rewards and bribes—<del>namely</del>
persons who do not hold the pure faith—to raise an uproar in the church, and seem to ask
for the said man as bishop; I judge that these frauds must be condemned, so that such an
one should not receive even lay communion at the last. If ye all approve, do ye decree it.</p>
<p>The synod answered: We approve.</p>

<p>If anyone shall pass from one city to another, and shall raise up seditions, tickling the
people and be assisted by them in raising a disturbance, he shall not be allowed communion
even when dying.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>To understand this canon aright it must be remembered that in the first ages of the
Church the people were accustomed to have a share in the election of their bishop; and he
whom the people demanded was usually ordained their bishop.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>This <del>penalty</del> is something unheard of and horrible, that he should not be deemed
worthy of communion even at the hour of death; for it is a provision found nowhere else
imposed by any canon, nor inflicted upon any sin.</p>

<pb n="808"/>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The Greek author Aristenus <del>in the above remarks</del> probably has not erred from the
truth when he asserts that to no crime was this penalty attached, if he refers to the Eastern
Churches; for Morinus himself (in the xixth chapter of the ixth book, De Penitentia), confesses
that this penalty was never attached to any crime among the Easterns: nevertheless in some
Churches in the first ages the three crimes of idolatry, murder, and adultery were thus
punished: that is, that to those who admitted any one of these, reconciliation was denied
even at his death, “and this,” says Morinus, “I think no one can deny, who is at all versed in
the testimony of the ancients on this point.”</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>The addition in the Latin text, qui sinceram fidem non habent, is found both in Dionysius
Exiguus and in Isidore and the Prisca, and its meaning is as follows: “In a town, some few,
especially those who have not the true faith, can be easily bribed to demand this or that
person as bishop.” The Fathers of Sardica plainly had here in view the Arians and their
adherents, who, through such like machinations, when they had gained over, if only a small
party in a town, sought to press into the bishoprics. The Synod of Antioch moreover, in
341, although the Eusebians, properly speaking, were dominant there, had laid down in the
twenty-first canon a similar, only less severe, rule.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Raymond’s Decretales, cap. ii, De
electione, but with the noteworthy addition “unless he shall have repented.” These words
do not occur in the other Latin versions, and Hefele thinks them to have been added by
Raymond of Pennaforte.</p>

province to another province in which there are bishops, unless indeed he be called by his
brethren, that we seem not to close the gates of charity.</p>
<p>And this case likewise is to be provided for, that if in any province a bishop has some
matter against his brother and fellow-bishop, neither of the two should call in as arbiters
bishops from another province.</p>
<p>But if perchance sentence be given against a bishop in any matter and he supposes his
case to be not unsound but good, in order that the question may be reopened, let us, if it
seem good to your charity, honour the memory of Peter the Apostle, and let those who gave
judgment write to Julius, the bishop of Rome, so that, if necessary, the case may be retried
by the bishops of the neighbouring provinces and let him appoint arbiters; but if it cannot
be shown that his case is of such a sort as to need a new trial, let the judgment once given
not be annulled, but stand good as before.</p>

need not be disturbed, what he has decreed shall be confirmed. Is this the pleasure
of all? The synod answered, It is our pleasure.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon</p>
<p>No bishop, unless called thereto, shall pass to another city. Moreover a bishop of the
province who is engaged in any litigation shall not appeal to outside bishops. But if Rome
hears the cause, even outsiders may be present.</p>

<pb n="810"/>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>According to the reading of Dionysius and Isidore, as well as of the Greeks, Balsamon,
Zonaras and Aristenus, as also of Hervetus the provision is that bishops of one province
shall not pass to another in which there are not bishops.</p>
<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>Not only are bishops prohibited from changing their cities, and passing from a smaller
to a larger one, but also from passing from one province to another in which there are
bishops, for the sake of doing any ecclesiastical work there unless they are called by the
bishops of that province.</p>
<p>On the phrase “if it pleases you” the following from St. Athanasius is much to the point
(cit. by Pusey, Councils, p. 143). “They <del>i.e., the Council of Nice</del> wrote concerning Easter,
‘It seemed good’ as follows: for it did then seem good, that there should be a general compliance;
but about the faith they wrote not ‘It seemed good,’ but ‘Thus believes the Catholic
Church’; and thereupon they confessed how the faith lay, in order to shew that their sentiments
were not novel, but apostolic.”</p>
<p>Tillemont.</p>
<p>This form is very strong to shew that it was a right which the Pope had not had hitherto.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Peter de Marca (De Concordia Sacerdotii et Imperii, Lib. VII., Cap. iij., § 8) says that
Hosius here proposed to the fathers to honour the memory of St. Peter that he might the
more easily lead them to consent to this new privilege; for, as De Marca has proved, the
right here bestowed upon the Roman Pontiff was clearly unknown before.</p>
<p>It has been urged that the mention of the pope by name, intimates clearly that the provision
of these canons of an appeal to Rome was of a purely temporary character; and some
famous authors such as Edmund Richer, of the Sorbonne, have written in defence of this
view, but Hefele quotes with great force the words of the learned Protestant, Spittler (Critical
Examination of the Sardican Decisions, Spittler, Sämmtlichen Werken, P. viij., p. 129 sq.).</p>
<p>Spittler.</p>
<p>It is said that these Sardican decisions were simply provisional, and intended for the
present necessity; because Athanasius, so hardly pressed by the Arians, could only be rescued
by authorizing an appeal to the Bishop of Rome for a final judgment. Richer, in his History
of the General Councils, has elaborately defended this opinion, and Horix also has declared

<pb n="811"/>
in its favour. But would not all secure use of the canons of the councils be done away with
if this distinction between provisional and permanent synodal decisions were admitted? Is
there any sure criterion for distinguishing those canons which were only to be provisional,
from the others which were made for all future centuries? The Fathers of the Synod of
Sardica express themselves quite generally; is it not therefore most arbitrary on our part to
insert limitations? It is beyond question that these decisions were occasioned by the very
critical state of the affairs of Athanasius; but is everything only provisional that is occasioned
by the circumstances of individuals? In this way the most important of the ancient canons
might be set aside.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>According to the Greek text, and that of Dionysius, those who had pronounced the first
judgment were to write to Rome; and Fuchs rightly adds, that they were to do this at the
desire of the condemned. But, according to Isidore and the Prisca, the right or the duty of
bringing the affair before Rome, also belonged to the neighbouring bishops. I believe that
the last interpretation has only arisen through a mistake, from a comment belonging to the
next sentence being inserted in the wrong place. It only remains to be remarked here, that
Isidore and the Prisca have not the name Julio,<gap reason="omitted"/>But Hardouin’s conjecture, that instead
of Julio, perhaps illi may be read, is entirely gratuitous, contrary to the Greek text, and plainly
only a stratagem against the Gallicans.</p>
<p>This canon is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s Decretum, Pars II., Causa
VI., Quæst. iv., Canon j. 7, in Isidore’s version. Dionysius’s version is quite wrong as given
by Justellus and in the Munich edition, changing the negative into the affirmative in the
phrase ne unus de duobus.</p>

<head>Canon IV.</head>
<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Gaudentius said: If it seems good to you, it is necessary to add to this decision
full of sincere charity which thou hast pronounced, that390 if any bishop be deposed by the
sentence of these neighbouring bishops, and assert that he has fresh matter in defence, a
new bishop be not settled in his see, unless the bishop of Rome judge and render a decision
as to this.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Gaudentius said: It ought to be added, if it be your pleasure, to this sentence
full of sanctity which thou hast pronounced, that—when any bishop has been deposed by
the judgment of those bishops who have sees in neighbouring places, and he <del>the bishop
deposed</del> shall announce that his case is to be examined in the city of Rome—that no other
bishop shall in any wise be ordained to his see, after the appeal of him who is apparently
deposed, unless the case shall have been determined in the judgment of the Roman bishop.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</p>
<p>If a bishop has been deposed and affirms that he has an excuse to urge, unless Rome has
judged the case, no bishop shall be appointed in his room. For he might treat the decree with
scorn either through his nuncios or by his letters.</p>
<p>There are two distinct understandings of this canon. The one view is that the “neighbours”
of this canon are the same as the “neighbours” of the preceding canon (number iij.)
and that the meaning of this canon therefore is—If the court of second instance, correlating
of the bishops of the neighbouring province, has pronounced the accused guilty, he still has
one more appeal to a third court, viz., Rome. This is the view taken by the Greeks, Zonaras
and Balsamon, by the Ballerini, Van Espen, Palma, Walter, Natalis Alexander and many
others.</p>
<p>In direct opposition to this is the view that there is no third but only a second appeal
mentioned by the canon. The supporters of this interpretation are Peter de Marca, Tillemont,
Dupin, Fleury, Remi Ceillier, Neander, Stolberg, Echhorn, Kober, and with these Hefele
sides and states his reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<note type="footnote">390 At this point begins the Greek text as given in Bev.</note>

<pb n="813"/>
<p>There must be added to the reasons of the connexion of this canon with the preceding,
the course of events, etc.:</p>
<p>1. That it certainly would be very curious if in the third canon mention was made of
the appeal to Rome as following the judgment of the court of first instance; in the fourth,
after that of the court of second instance; and again in the fifth, after the judgment of the
court of first instance.</p>
<p>2. That if the Synod had really intended to institute a court of third instance, it would
have done so in clearer and more express terms, and not only have, as it were, smuggled in
the whole point with the secondary question, as to “what was to be done with the bishop’s
see.”</p>
<p>3. Farther, that it is quite devoid of proof that the expression “neighbouring bishops”
is identical with “Bishops in the neighbourhood of the said Province,” that, indeed this
identification is throughout unwarrantable and wrong, and it is far more natural to understand
by the neighbouring bishops, the comprovincials, therefore the court of first instance.</p>
<p>4. That by this interpretation we obtain clearness, consistency, and harmony in all three
canons.</p>
<p>5. That the word πάλιν in the fourth canon presents no difficulty; for even one who
has only been heard in the court of first instance may say he desires again to defend himself,
because he has already made his first defence in the court of first instance.</p>

<p>Bishop Hosius said: Decreed, that if any bishop is accused, and the bishops of the same
region assemble and depose him from his office, and he appealing, so to speak, takes refuge
with the most blessed bishop of the Roman church, and he be willing to give him a hearing,
and think it right to renew the examination of his case, let him be pleased to write to those
fellow-bishops who are nearest the province that they may examine the particulars with
care and accuracy and give their votes on the matter in accordance with the word of truth.
And if any one require that his case be heard yet again, and at his request it seem good to
move the bishop of Rome to send presbyters a latere, let it be in the power of that bishop,
according as he judges it to be good and decides it to be right—that some be sent to be judges
with the bishops and invested with his authority by whom they were sent. And be this also
ordained. But if he think that the bishops are sufficient for the examination and decision
of the matter let him do what shall seem good in his most prudent judgment.</p>

he think it right that the trial or examination of his case be renewed, let him be pleased to
write to those bishops who are in an adjacent and neighbouring province, that they may
diligently inquire into all the particulars and decide according to the word of truth. But if
he who asks to have his case reheard, shall by his entreaty move the Bishop of Rome to send
a presbyter a latere it shall be in the power of that bishop to do what he shall resolve and
determine upon; and if he shall decide that some be sent, who shall be present and be judges
with the bishops invested with his authority by whom they were appointed, it shall be as he
shall choose. But if he believe that the bishops suffice to give a final decision, he shall do
what he shall determine upon in his most wise judgment.</p>

<head>Canon VI.</head>
<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: If it happen that in a province in which there are very many bishops
one bishop should stay away and by some negligence should not come to the council and
assent to the appointment made by the bishops, but the people assemble and pray that the
ordination of the bishop desired by them take place—it is necessary that the bishop who
stayed away should first be reminded by letters from the exarch of the province (I mean, of
course, the bishop of the metropolis), that the people demand a pastor to be given them. I
think that it is well to await his <del>the absent bishop’s</del> arrival also. But if after summons by
letter he does not come, nor even write in reply, the wish of the people ought to be complied
with.</p>
<p>The bishops from the neighbouring provinces also should be invited to the ordination
of the bishop of the metropolis.</p>
<p>It is positively not permitted to ordain a bishop in a village or petty town, for which
even one single presbyter is sufficient (for there is no necessity to ordain a bishop there) lest
the name and authority of bishop should be made of small account, but the bishops of the
province ought, as before said, to ordain bishops in those cities in which there were bishops
previously; and if a city should be found with a population so large as to be thought worthy
of an episcopal see, let it receive one.</p>
<p>Is this the pleasure of all? All answered: It is our pleasure.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: If it shall have happened, that in a province in which there have
been very many bishops, one <del>i.e., but one</del> bishop remains, but that he by negligence has
not chosen <del>to ordain</del> a bishop, and the people have made application, the bishops of the
neighbouring province ought first to address <del>by letter</del> the bishop who resides in that
province, and show that the people seek a ruler <del>i.e., pastor</del> for themselves and that this is
right, so that they also may come and with him ordain a bishop. But if he refuses to acknowledge
their written communication, and leaves it unnoticed, and writes no reply, the people’s
request should be satisfied, so that bishops should come from the neighbouring province
and ordain a bishop.</p>
<p>But permission is not to be given to ordain a bishop either in any village, or in an unimportant
city, for which one presbyter suffices, lest the name and authority of bishop grow
cheap. Those <del>bishops</del> who are invited from another province ought not to ordain a bishop
unless in the cities which have <del>previously</del> had bishops, or in a city which is so important
or so populous as to be entitled to have a bishop.</p>
<p>Is this the pleasure of all? The synod replied: It is our pleasure.</p>

<pb n="817"/>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>If the bishops were present when the people were seeking for a bishop, and one was away,
let that one be called. But if he is willing to answer the call neither by letter nor in person, let
him be ordained whom they desire.</p>
<p>When a Metropolitan is appointed the neighbouring bishops are to be sent for.</p>
<p>In a little city and town, for which one presbyter suffices, a bishop is not to be appointed.
But if the city be very populous, it is not unfitting to do so.</p>
<p>The second portion of this canon is entirely lacking in the Latin. The Greek scholiasts,
Zonaras, Balsamon, and Aristenus, understand this to mean “that ‘at the appointment of a
metropolitan the bishops of the neighbouring provinces shall also be invited,’ probably to
give greater solemnity to the act,” so says Hefele. And to this agree Van Espen, Tillemont,
and Herbst.</p>
<p>The first part in the Greek and Latin have different meanings; the Greek text contemplating
the case of one bishop stopping away from a meeting of bishops for an election to
fill a vacancy; the Latin text the case of there being only one bishop left in a province (after
war, pestilence, or the like). This second meaning is accepted by Van Espen, Christian
Lupus and others. Moreover, it would seem from Flodoard’s History of the Church of Rheims
(Geschichte der Rheimser Kirche, Lib. III., c. 20 <del>a book I have never seen</del>) that the Gallican
Church acted upon this understanding of this canon. It is that also of Gratian.</p>
<p>Between the Latin and the Greek text stands the interpretation of Zonaras, which is that
if a province once having many bishops has by any contingency only one left besides the
Metropolitan, and he neglects to be present at the consecration of the new bishops, he is to
be summoned by letter of the Metropolitan, and if he does not then come, the consecrations
are to go on without him. With this explanation Harmenopulus also agrees, adding further
that the Metropolitan might alone consecrate the bishops, resting his argument on the words
τὸ ἱκαυὸν κ.τ λ.</p>
<p>Some scholars have supposed that neither the present Greek nor the present Latin text
represent the original, but that the Greek text is nearest to it, but must be corrected by an
ancient Latin version found by Maffei in a codex at Verona. The Ballerini have devoted
careful attention to this point in their notes to the Works of St. Leo the Great (Tom. iii., p.
xxxij. 4). It would seem that this might be the canon quoted by the fathers of Constantinople
in 382, and if so, it would seem that they had a Greek text like that from which the Verona
version was made.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>

<pb n="818"/>
<p>The fathers of Sardica <del>in the second part of this canon, which is Canon VII. by the
Latin computation</del> decreed two things: first, that where the people justly asked for a Pastor
to be ordained for them, their demand should be complied with; but where the people insisted
upon having a bishop ordained for a village or little city, for which one presbyter was all
that was needed, no attention should be paid to their demands, lest the name and authority
of a bishop should become despicable.</p>

<head>Canon VII.</head>
<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: Our importunity and great pertinacity and unjust petitions have
brought it about that we do not have as much favour and confidence as we ought to enjoy.
For many of the bishops do not intermit resorting to the imperial Court, especially the
Africans, who, as we have learned from our beloved brother and fellow-bishop, Gratus, do
not accept salutary counsels, but so despise them that one man carries to the Court petitions
many and diverse and of no possible benefit to the Church, and does not (as ought to be
done and as is fitting) assist and help the poor and the laity or the widows, but is intriguing
to obtain worldly dignities and offices for certain persons. This evil then causes enfeeblement
<del>better, murmuring (read τονθρυσμόν or τονθορυσμόν)</del>, not without some scandal and
blame to us. But I account it quite proper for a bishop to give assistance to one oppressed
by some one, or to a widow suffering injustice, or, again, an orphan robbed of his estate,
always provided that these persons have a just cause of petition.</p>
<p>If, then, beloved brethren, this seems good to all, do ye decree that no bishop shall go
to the imperial Court except those whom our most pious emperor may summon by his own
letters. Yet since it often happens that persons condemned for their offences to deportation
or banishment to an island, or who have received some sentence or other, beg for mercy
and seek refuge with the Church <del>i.e., take sanctuary</del>, such persons are not to be refused
assistance, but pardon should be asked for them without delay and without hesitation. If
this, then, is also your pleasure, do ye all vote assent.</p>
<p>All gave answer: Be this also decreed.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: Importunities and excessive pertinacity and unjust petitions have
caused us to have too little favour or confidence, while certain bishops cease not to go to
the Court, especially the Africans, who (as we have learned) spurn and contemn the salutary
counsels of our most holy brother and fellow-bishop, Gratus, so that they not only bring to
the Court many and diverse petitions (not for the good of the Church nor, as is usual and
right, to succour the poor or widows or orphans), but even seek to obtain worldly dignities
and offices for certain persons. This evil therefore stirs up at times not only murmurings,
but even scandals. But it is proper that bishops should intercede for persons suffering from
violence and oppression, afflicted widows and defrauded orphans, provided, nevertheless,
that these persons have a just cause or petition.</p>
<p>If, then, brethren dearly beloved, such be your pleasure, do we decree that no bishops
go to the Court except those who may have been invited or summoned by letters of the Godfearing
emperor. But since it often happens that those who are suffering from injustice or

<pb n="820"/>
who are condemned for their offences to deportation or banishment to an island, or, in
short, have received some sentence or other, seek refuge with the mercy of the Church, such
persons should be succoured and pardon be begged for them without hesitation. Decree
this, therefore, if it be your pleasure.</p>
<p>All said: It is our pleasure and be it decreed.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</p>
<p>When an orphan, widow, and other desolate persons are oppressed by force let the bishop
give them succour and approach the Emperor; but through a pretext of this kind let him not
be a hanger on of the camp, but rather let him send a deacon.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The “salutary counsels” (salutaria consilia) here seem to be synodical admonitions, as
Zonaras notes; and these might well be ascribed to Gratus, the bishop of Carthage, because
many of the African synods were held under his presidency and direction.</p>
<gap reason="omitted"/>
<p>Nothing is more noteworthy than how from the first princes summoned bishops in
counsel with regard to affairs touching either the estate of the Church or of the Realm; and
called them to their presence in urgent and momentous cases, and kept them with them.</p>
<p>Justinian, the emperor, in his Novels (Chapter II.) defines that no one of the God-beloved
bishops shall dare to be absent any more from his diocese for a whole year, and adds this
exception, “unless he does so on account of an imperial jussio; in this case alone he shall be
held to be without blame.”</p>
<p>On this whole matter of bishops interceding for culprits, and especially for those condemned
to death, see St. Augustine (Epist. 153 ad Macedonium).</p>

<p>This decree is threefold. First, that the bishop in going to Court should not fall under
suspicion either at Court or of his own people that he was approaching the Prince to obtain
some cause of his own. Second, according to the interpretation of Zonaras, “that no one
should be angry with the Minister or Deacon who tarried in camp, as the bishop had departed
thence.” And third, that the Minister could carry away what he had asked for, that is (according
to Zonaras), the letters of the Emperor pardoning the fault, or such like other matters.</p>

<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: This also, I think, follows, that,392 if in any province whatever,
bishops send petitions to one of their brothers and fellow-bishops, he that is in the largest
city, that is, the metropolis, should himself send his deacon and the petitions, providing
him also with letters commendatory, writing also of course in succession to our brethren
and fellow-bishops, if any of them should be staying at that time in the places or cities in
which the most pious Emperor is administering public affairs.</p>
<p>But if any of the bishops should have friends at the Court and should wish to make requests
of them as to some proper object, let him not be forbidden to make such requests
through his deacon and move these <del>friends</del> to give their kind assistance as his desire.</p>
<p>But those who come to Rome ought, as I said before, to deliver to our beloved brother
and fellow-bishop, Julius, the petitions which they have to give, in order that he may first
examine them, lest some of them should be improper, and so, giving them his own advocacy
and care, shall send them to the Court.</p>
<p>All the Bishops made answer that such was their pleasure and that the regulation was
most proper.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>This also seems to follow, that from whatever province bishops shall send petitions to
that brother and fellow-bishop of ours who has his see in the metropolis, he <del>the metropolitan</del>
should dispatch his deacon with the petitions, providing him with commendatory
letters of like tenour to our brethren and fellow-bishops at that time resident in those regions
and cities in which the fortunate and blessed Emperor is ruling the State.</p>
<p>If however a bishop who seeks to obtain some petition (a worthy one, that is) has friends
in the palace, he is not forbidden to make his request through his deacon and to advise those
who, he knows, can kindly intercede for him in his absence.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</p>
<p>If one brother sends to another, let the Metropolitan fortify the nuncio with letters; and
let him write to the bishops, who have the matter in hand, to protect the nuncio.</p>
<p>Here the Latin is not only a translation but an interpretation of the Greek text, for it
distinctly says that every bishop shall send the petition he intends to present at court first
to his Metropolitan, who shall send it in. This is not clearly in the Greek, and yet the Greek
Commentators find it there.</p>
<p>Christian Lupus.</p>
<p>The authority of the bishop alone is not sufficient to send a deacon to Court, there must
be added the judgment of the Metropolitan who shall examine the petition, prove, sign, and
commend it, not only to the Prince, but also to the bishop in whose diocese he may happen
to be.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Zonaras, Balsamon, and Aristenus explained this canon somewhat differently, thus:
“If a bishop desires to send his petitions addressed to the Emperor to the bishop of the town
where the Emperor is staying, he shall first send them to the Metropolitan of that province
(according to Aristenus, his own Metropolitan) and the latter shall send his own deacon
with letters of recommendation to the bishop or bishops who may be at court.” This difference
rests upon the various meanings of “to the brother and fellow-bishop” in the beginning
of the canon. We understand by this his own Metropolitan, and treat the words: ὁ ἐν τῇ
μείζονι κ.τ.λ., as a more exact definition of “fellow-bishop,” and the participle τυγχάνων
as equivalent to τυγχάνει, and make the principal clause begin at αὐτὸς καὶ τὸν διάκονον.
Beveridge translated the canon in the same way. Zonaras and others, on the contrary, understood
by “fellow-bishop,” the bishop of the Emperor’s residence for the time being, and
regarded the words ὁ ἐν τῇ μείζοη κ.τ λ. not as a clearer definition of what had gone before,
but as the principal clause, in the sense of “then the Metropolitan shall,” etc. According to
this interpretation, the words conveying the idea that the bishop must have recourse to the
Metropolitan are entirely wanting in the canon.</p>
<p>The first part of this Canon is the last part of Canon IX. of the Latin. The last part is
Canon X. of the Latin, but the personal part about Alypius is omitted from the Greek.</p>

<p>Bishop Hosius said: This also I think necessary.393 Ye should consider with all thoroughness
and care, that if some rich man or professional advocate be desired for bishop, he
be not ordained until he have fulfilled the ministry of reader, deacon, and presbyter, in order
that, passing by promotion through the several grades, he may advance (if, that is, he be
found worthy) to the height of the episcopate. And he shall remain in each order assuredly
for no brief time, that so his faith, his reputable life, his steadfastness of character and considerateness
of demeanour may be well-known, and that he, being deemed worthy of the
divine sacerdotal office <del>sacerdotium, i.e., the episcopate</del> may enjoy the highest honour.
For it is not fitting, nor does discipline or good conversation allow to proceed to this act
rashly or lightly, so as to ordain a bishop or presbyter or deacon hastily; as thus he would
rightly be accounted a novice, especially since also the most blessed Apostle, he who was
the teacher of the Gentiles, is seen to have forbidden hasty ordinations; for the test of <del>even</del>
the longest period will not unreasonably be required to exemplify the conversation and
character of each <del>candidate</del>.</p>
<p>All said that this was their pleasure and that it must be absolutely irreversible.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: This also I think it necessary for you to consider most carefully,
that if perchance some rich man or professional advocate or ex-official be desired for bishop,
he be not ordained until he have fulfilled the ministry of a reader and the office of deacon
and presbyter, and so ascend, if he have shown himself worthy, through the several grades
to the height of the episcopate. For by these promotions which in any case take a considerable
length of time can be tested his faith, his discretion, his gravity and modesty. And if he be
found worthy, let him be honoured with the divine sacerdotal office <del>i.e. the episcopate</del>.
For it is not fitting, nor does order or discipline allow, that one be rashly or lightly ordained
bishop, presbyter or deacon, who is a novice, especially since also the blessed Apostle, the
teacher of the Gentiles, is seen to have expressly forbidden it. But those <del>should be ordained</del>

<head>Canon XI.</head>
<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: This also we ought to decree, that394 when a bishop comes from
one city to another city, or from one province to another province, to indulge boastfulness,
ministering to his own praises rather than serving religious devotion, and wishes to prolong
his stay <del>in a city</del>, and the bishop of that city is not skilled in teaching, let him <del>the visiting
bishop</del> not do despite to the bishop of the place and attempt by frequent discourses to disparage
him and lessen his repute (for this device is wont to cause tumults), and strive by
such arts to solicit and wrest to himself another’s throne, not scrupling to abandon the
church committed to him and to procure translation to another. A definite limit of time
should therefore be set in such a case, especially since not to receive a bishop is accounted
the part of rude and discourteous persons. Ye remember that in former times our fathers
decreed that if a layman were staying in a city and should not come to divine worship for
three <del>successive</del> Sundays <del>that is</del>, for three <del>full</del> weeks, he should be repelled from communion.
If then this has been decreed in the case of laymen, it is neither needful, nor fitting,
nor yet even expedient that a bishop, unless he has some grave necessity or difficult business,
should be very long absent from his own church and distress the people committed to him.</p>
<p>All the bishops said: We decide that this decree also is most proper.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: This also ye ought to determine. If a bishop comes from one city
to another city, or from his own province to another province, and serving ambition rather
than devotion, wishes to remain resident for a long time in a strange city, and then (as it
perchance happens that the bishop of the place is not so practised or so learned as himself)
he, the stranger, should begin to do him despite and deliver frequent discourses to disparage
him and lessen his repute, not hesitating by this device to leave the church assigned him
and remove to that which is another’s—do ye then <del>in such a case</del> set a limit of time <del>for
his stay in the city</del>, because on the one hand to refuse to receive a bishop is discourteous,
and on the other his too long stay is mischievous. Provision must be made against this. I
remember that in a former council our brethren decreed that if any layman did not attend
divine service in a city in which he was staying three Sundays, that is, for three weeks, he
should be deprived of communion. If then this has been decreed in the case of laymen, it
is far less lawful and fitting that a bishop, if there be no grave necessity detaining him, should
be absent from his church longer than the time above written.</p>

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</p>
<p>A bishop when called in by another bishop, if he that called him is unskilled, must not be
too assiduous in preaching, for this would be indecorous to the unlearned bishop, and an attack
upon his bishopric. And both improper. Without grave necessity it is undesirable for a bishop
to be absent from his church.</p>
<p>This is Canon XIV. of the Latin.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>To understand this canon it must be again remembered that in the first ages of the
Church bishops were wont to be appointed at the demand of the people; wherefore whoever
were going around after the episcopate, were accustomed to solicit the hearts of the people,
and to make it their study to win their affections.</p>

<head>Canon XII.</head>
<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: Since no case should be left unprovided for, let this also be decreed.
395 Some of our brethren and fellow-bishops are known to possess very little private
property in the cities in which they are placed as bishops, but have great possessions in
other places, with which they are, moreover, able to help the poor. I think then permission
should be given them, if they are to visit their estates and attend to the gathering of the
harvest, to pass three Sundays, that is, to stay for three weeks, on their estates, and to assist
at divine worship and celebrate the liturgy in the nearest church in which a presbyter holds
service, in order that they may not be seen to be absent from worship, and in order that they
may not come too frequently to the city in which there is a bishop. In this way their private
affairs will suffer no loss from their absence and they will be seen to be clear from the charge
of ambition and arrogance.</p>
<p>All the bishops said: This decree also is approved by us.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: Since no case should be left unprovided for <del>let this also be decreed</del>.
There are some of our brother-bishops, who do not reside in the city in which they are appointed
bishops, either because they have but little property there, while they are known to
have considerable estates elsewhere, or, it may be, through affection for kith and kin and in
complaisance to these. Let this much be permitted them, to go to their estates to superintend
and dispose of their harvest, and <del>for this purpose</del> to remain over three Sundays, that is,
for three weeks, if it be necessary, on their estates; or else, if there is a neighbouring city in
which there is a presbyter, in order that they may not be seen to pass Sunday without church,
let them go thither, so that <del>in this way</del> neither will their private affairs suffer loss from
their absence, nor will they, by frequent going to the city in which a bishop is resident, incur
the suspicion of ambition and place-seeking. All said that this was approved by them.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</p>
<p>If a bishop has possessions outside his diocese, and visits them, let him be careful not to
remain there more than three Lord’s days. For thus his own flock will be enriched by him,

is to be absent from his diocese for more than three Lord’s days, without grave necessity, in
this canon a certain modification is introduced with regard to certain bishops.</p>

<p>According to the Latin text of Dionysius, it is: “Some bishops do not reside in their

<head>Canon XIV.</head>
<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: I must not fail to speak of a matter which constantly urgeth me.397
If a bishop be found quick to anger (which ought not to sway such a man), and he, suddenly
moved against a presbyter or deacon, be minded to cast him out of the Church, provision
must be made that such a one be not condemned too hastily <del>or read ἀθῶον, if innocent</del>
and deprived of communion.</p>
<p>All said: Let him that is cast out be authorized to take refuge with the bishop of the
metropolis of the same province. And if the bishop of the metropolis is absent, let him
hasten to the bishop that is nearest, and ask to have his case carefully examined. For a
hearing ought not to be denied those who ask it.</p>
<p>And that bishop who cast out such a one, justly or unjustly, ought not to take it ill that
examination of the case be made, and his decision confirmed or revised. But, until all the
particulars have been examined with care and fidelity, he who is excluded from communion
ought not to demand communion in advance of the decision of his case. And if any of the
clergy who have met <del>to hear the case</del> clearly discern arrogance and pretentiousness in him,
inasmuch as it is not fitting to suffer insolence or unjust censure, they ought to correct such
an one with somewhat harsh and grievous language, that men may submit to and obey
commands that are proper and right. For as the bishop ought to manifest sincere love and
regard to his subordinates, so those who are subject to him ought in like manner to perform
the duties of their ministry in sincerity towards their bishops.</p>
<p>(Latin.)</p>
<p>Bishop Hosius said: I must not fail to speak of a matter which further moveth me. If
some bishop is perchance quick to anger (which ought not to be the case) and, moved
hastily and violently against one of his presbyters or deacons, be minded to cast him out of
the Church, provision must be made that an innocent man be not condemned or deprived
of communion.</p>
<p>Therefore let him that is cast out be authorized to appeal to the neighbouring bishops
and let his case be heard and examined into more diligently. For a hearing ought not to be
denied one who asks it.</p>
<p>And let that bishop who cast him out, justly or unjustly, take it patiently that the matter
is discussed, so that his sentence may either be approved by a number <del>of judges</del> or else
revised. Nevertheless, until all the particulars shall be examined with care and fidelity, no
one else ought to presume to admit to communion him who was excluded therefrom in

and pride in <del>such</del> clergy, inasmuch as it surely is not fitting for a bishop to suffer wrong
or insult, let them correct them with some severity of language, that they may obey a bishop
whose commands are proper and right. For as he <del>the bishop</del> ought to manifest sincere

<p>Fuchs, in his Bibliothek der Kirchenversammlungen (Pt. II., p. 123, note 125)400, thinks
he has discovered a difference between this canon and the exclusively Latin one preceding
it, in that the latter supposes the case of a bishop ordaining a foreign cleric, over whom he
has no jurisdiction, to a higher grade, with the view of retaining him for his own diocese;
while the other—fifteenth or nineteenth canon—treats of a case where such an ordination
takes place without the ordaining bishop intending to keep the person ordained for his own
diocese. Van Espen is of another opinion, and maintains that both canons obviously refer
to one and the same case, for which reason the Greek text has only inserted one of them.
It is certain that the text of both canons, as we have it, does not clearly indicate the difference
conjectured by Fuchs, but that it may easily be found there.</p>

Bishop of Carthage, and Primate of Africa, in the First Synod of Carthage testified that in

who were once advanced to clerical office in the Church by certain of our brethren, if they
are not willing to return to the churches to which they were nominated <del>or, espoused</del>,
should for the future not be received, and that neither Eutychianus should continue to vindicate
to himself the name of bishop, nor yet that Musæus be accounted a bishop; but that

<p>(Greek.)</p>
<p>Bishop Gaudentius said: These things wholesomely, duly, and fitly decreed, in the estimation
of us the bishops <del>τῶν ἱερέων</del> such as are pleasing both to God and to man will
not be able to obtain due force and validity, unless fear <del>of a penalty</del> be added to the decrees
proclaimed. For we ourselves know that through the shamelessness of a few, the divine and
right reverend title of bishop <del>of the τῆς ἱερωσύνης</del> hath often come into condemnation.
If therefore any one, moved by arrogance and ambition rather than seeking to please God,
should have the hardihood to pursue a different course of action, contrary to the decree of
all, let him know beforehand that he must give account and defend himself on this charge,
and lose the honour and dignity of the episcopate.</p>
<p>All answered: This sentence is proper and right, and such is our pleasure.402</p>
<p>And this decree will be most widely known and best carried into effect, if each of those
bishops among us who have sees on the thoroughfares or highway, on seeing a bishop <del>pass
by</del> shall inquire into the cause of his passage and his place of destination. And if at his departure
he shall find that he is going to the Court, he will direct his inquiries with reference
to the objects <del>of a resort to the Court</del> above mentioned. And if he come by invitation let
no obstacle be put in the way of his departure. But if he is trying to go to the Court out of
ostentation, as hath afore been said by your charity, or to urge the petitions of certain persons,
let neither his letters be signed nor let such an one be received to communion.</p>
<p>All said: Be this also decreed.</p>

your action. For we ourselves know that through the shamelessness of a few the sacred and
venerable sacerdotal <del>—episcopal</del> name hath been many times and oft brought to blame.
If therefore anyone attempts to oppose the judgment of all and seeks to serve ambition
rather than please God, he must be given to know that he will have to render an account
and lose office and rank.</p>
<note type="footnote">402 Here begins the Canon xxj., according to the Greek text of Bev.</note>

<pb n="842"/>
<p>This can be carried into effect only provided each of us whose see is on the highway
shall, if he sees a bishop pass, inquire into the cause of his journey, ascertain his destination,
and if he finds that he is on his way to the Court, satisfy himself as to what is contained
above <del>i.e., as to his objects at Court</del>, lest perhaps he has come by invitation, that permission
may be given him to proceed. If, however, as your holiness mentioned above, he is going
to Court to urge petitions and applications for office, let neither his letters be signed nor let
him be received to communion.</p>

<p>If any bishop tries out of pride to do away with what has been decreed admirably, and in

This opinion is becoming and well-pleasing to us,” which indicate this to be the end of the
canon; and therefore the Greeks make of this two distinct canons.</p>
<p>Dionysius and Isidore make but one canon,<gap reason="omitted"/>and this appears to be more congruous
on account of the subject-matter of the first part, and will be manifest by connecting the

<p>Van Espen follows Zonaras and Balsamon in understanding “Bishops in Canali,” as
such as were set on the public roads and public highways, or rather “in cities which are on
the public highways, or ‘Canals,’ by which they that pass go without labour, as in a canal or
aqueduct the water flows, for aqueduct and canal are the same thing in the Roman tongue.”</p>

<p>This proposition of Hosius in the Roman Codex is joined as an appendix to the preceding

of Hosius’s rather than a synodal canon, for no adoption by the synod is recorded: or else
because, even if it were a decree, it was only of temporary character, that is to say, until the
canons had been sufficiently promulgated, and therefore some on the ground of ignorance

<head>Excursus on the Other Acts of the Council.</head>
<p>As only the Canons have any real connexion with the Ecumenical Synods, they alone
have properly a place in this volume, and yet it may not be amiss to give a brief account of
the other acts of the council, so far as we know them.</p>
<p>(a) The Rule for Keeping Easter.—The Anglican Scholar, the Rev. William Cureton, of
the British Museum, first edited the then recently discovered Preface to the Paschal Letters
of St. Athanasius, together with the Letters themselves. The ms. which he then published
was in Syriac and was discovered in Egypt. In the preface just referred to, it is expressly
stated that “a plan was agreed upon at Sardica with regard to the feast of Easter.” But this
new plan, which was only expected to hold good for fifty years, failed, and although in a.d.
346 Easter should have fallen on March 23d, yet the Council (so says St. Athanasius) agreed
to observe it on March 30th. Another divergence fell in a.d. 349. Easter, by the Alexandrian
calculation, would have been April 23d. But by Roman count, the origin of which was attributed
to St. Peter, Easter was never to be later than April 21st, and for the sake of peace
the Alexandrians yielded to the Romans and kept Easter on March 26th; but in 350, 360,
and 368 the Alexandrian and Roman methods again disagreed, and even the fifty years
which Sardica had thought to ensure uniformity were marked by diverse usages.</p>
<p>(b) The Encyclical Letter.—The Council addressed a long Encyclical letter to all the
bishops of the world; it is found in St. Athanasius403 in Greek, in St. Hilary of Poictiers404
in Latin, and in Theodoret’s Ecclesiastical History.405 In this last there occurs at the end the
so-called “Creed of Sardica,” which is now considered by scholars to be undoubtedly
spurious.</p>
<p>(c) A Letter to the Diocese of Alexandria.—St. Athanasius406 gives us the Greek text of
a letter sent by the council to the diocese of Alexandria to the bishops of Egypt and Libya.</p>
<p>(d) A Letter to Pope Julius.—Among the Fragments of St. Hilary407 is found a letter
from the synod to Pope Julius. Hefele says that the text is “considerably injured.” One
clause of this letter above all others has given occasion to much controversy. The passage
runs as follows: “It was best and fittest that the priests <del>i.e., bishops</del> from all the provinces
should make their reports to the head, that is, the chair of St. Peter.” Blondell declares the
passage to be an interpolation, resting his opinion upon the barbarous Latin of the expression

valde congruentissimum. And even Remi Ceillier, while explaining this by the supposition,
which is wholly gratuitous, that the original was Greek, yet is forced to confess that the
sentence interrupts the flow of thought and looks like an insertion. Bower,408 in his History
of the Popes, and Fuchs409 have urged still more strongly the spurious character of the phrase,
the latter using the convenient “marginal comment” explanation.</p>
<p>Besides these there are three documents which Scipio Maffei discovered in ms. at Verona,
which by some are supposed to belong to the Council of Sardica.</p>
<p>(a) A Letter to the Christians of Mareotis.</p>
<p>(b) A Letter of St. Athanasius to the same Mareotic Churches. This letter is signed not
only by Athanasius, but also by a great number of the bishops composing the synod.</p>
<p>(c) A Letter from St. Athanasius to the Church of Alexandria.</p>
<p>On the authority to be attributed to these three documents I can do no better than quote
the closing words of Hefele,410 whom I have followed in this whole excursus.</p>
<p>“These extracts shew, I think, quite sufficiently the spuriousness of these documents.
Is it possible that the Eusebians would have said of themselves: ‘We are enemies of Christ?’
But apart from this, the whole contents of these three letters are lame and feeble. The constant
repetition of the same words is intolerable, and the whole style pointless and trivial. To this
it must be added that the whole of Christian antiquity knew nothing of these three documents,
which only exist in the codex at Verona, so that we cannot acknowledge them as genuine.”</p>

<head>Excursus as to Whether the Sardican Council Was Ecumenical.</head>
<p>Some theologians and canonists have been of opinion that the Council of Sardica was
Ecumenical and would reckon it as the Second. But besides the fact that such a numbering
is absolutely in contrariety to all history it also labours under the difficulty, as we shall see
presently, that the Westerns by insisting that St. Athanasius should have a seat caused a division
of the synod at the very outset, so that the Easterns met at Philippopolis and confirmed
the deposition of the Saint. It is also interesting to remember that when Alexander Natalis
in his history expressly called this synod ecumenical, the passage was marked with disapproval
by the Roman censors.</p>
<p>(Hefele. Hist. Councils. Vol. II., pp. 172 et seqq.)</p>
<p>The ecumenical character of this Synod certainly cannot be proved.411 It is indeed true
that it was the design of Pope Julius, as well as of the two Emperors, Constantius and Constans,
to summon a General Council at Sardica; but we do not find that any such actually
took place: and the history of the Church points to many like cases, where a synod was
probably intended to be ecumenical, and yet did not attain that character. In the present
case, the Eastern and Western bishops were indeed summoned, but by far the greater
number of the Eastern bishops were Eusebians, and therefore Semi-Arians, and instead of
acting in a better mind in union with the orthodox, they separated themselves and formed
a cabal of their own at Philippopolis.</p>
<p>We cannot indeed agree with those who maintain that the departure of the Eusebians
in itself rendered it impossible for the synod to be ecumenical, or it would be in the power
of heretics to make an Ecumenical Council possible or not. We cannot, however, overlook
the fact that, in consequence of this withdrawal, the great Eastern Church was far more
poorly represented at Sardica, and that the entire number of bishops present did not even
amount to a hundred! So small a number of bishops can only form a General Council if
the great body of their absent colleagues subsequently give their express consent to what
has been decided. This was not, however, the case at the Synod of Sardica. The decrees
were no doubt at once sent for acceptance and signature to the whole of Christendom, but
not more than about two hundred of those bishops who had been absent signed, and of
these, ninety-four, or nearly half, were Egyptians. Out of the whole of Asia only a few
bishops from the provinces of Cyprus and Palestine signed, not one from the other Eastern
provinces; and even from the Latin Church in Africa, which at that time numbered at least
three hundred bishops, we meet with very few names. We cannot give much weight to the
<note type="footnote">411 Hefele refers to his having himself treated this matter fully in the Theologischer Quartalschrift of Tübingen,
1852.</note>

<pb n="847"/>
fact that the Emperor Constantius refused to acknowledge the decrees of Sardica: it is of
much greater importance that no single later authority declared it to be a General Council.
Natalis Alexander412 is indeed of opinion that because Pope Zosimus, in the year 417 or
418, cited the fifth canon of Sardica as Nicene, and a synod held at Constantinople in 382
cited the sixth as Nicene, the synod must evidently have been considered as an appendix to
that of Nicea, and therefore its equal, that is, must have been honoured as ecumenical. But
we have already shown how Zosimus and the bishops of Constantinople had been led into
this confusion from the defects of their manuscript collections of the canons. Athanasius,
Sulpicius Severus, Socrates, and the Emperor Justinian were cited in later times for the
ecumenical character of this synod. Athanasius calls it a μεγάλη σύνοδος; Sulpicius Severus
says it was ex toto orbe convocata; and Socrates relates that “Athanasius and other bishops
had demanded an Ecumenical Synod, and that of Sardica had been then summoned.413 It
is clear at the first glance that the two last authorities only prove that the Synod had been
intended to be a general one, and the expression “Great Synod,” used by Athanasius, cannot
be taken as simply identical with ecumenical. While, however, the Emperor Justinian, in
his edict of 346, on the Three Chapters, calls the Synod of Sardica ecumenical, he yet, in the
same edict, as well as in other places, does not reckon it among the General Councils, of
which he counts four. To this must be added, first, that the Emperor is not the authority
entitled to decide as to the character of an Ecumenical Synod; and secondly, that the expression
Universale Concilium was employed in a wider sense in speaking of those synods which,
without being general, represented a whole patriarchate.</p>
<p>The Trullan Synod and Pope Nicholas I. are further appealed to. The former in its
second canon approved of the Sardican canons, and Pope Nicholas said of them: “omnis
Ecclesia recepit eos.” But this in no way contains a declaration that the Synod of Sardica was
ecumenical, for the canons of many other councils also—for instance, Ancyra, Neocæsarea,
and others—were generally received without those synods themselves being therefore esteemed
ecumenical. Nay, the Trullan Synod itself speaks for us; for had it held the Synod
of Sardica to be the second General Council, it would have placed its canons immediately
after those of Nice, whereas they are placed after the four ancient General Councils, and
from this we see that the Trullan Synod did not reckon the Sardican among those councils,
but after them. To this it must be added that the highest Church authorities speak most
decidedly against the synod being ecumenical. We may appeal first to Augustine, who only
knew of the Eusebian assembly at Sardica, and nothing at all of an orthodox synod in that
place; which would have been clearly impossible, if it had at that time been counted among

<pb n="848"/>
the ecumenical synods. Pope Gregory the Great414 and St. Isidore of Seville415 speak still
more plainly. They only know of four ancient General Councils—those of Nice, Constantinople,
Ephesus, and Chalcedon. The objection of the Ballerini that Gregory and Isidore
did not intend to enumerate the most ancient general synods as such, but only those which
issued important dogmatic decrees, is plainly quite arbitrary, and therefore without force.
Under such circumstances it is natural that among the later scholars by far the great majority
should have answered the question, whether the Synod of Sardica is ecumenical, in the
negative, as have Cardinal Bellarmin, Peter de Marca, Edmund Richer, Fleury, Orsi, Sacharelli,
Tillemont, Du Pin, Berti, Ruttenstock, Rohrbacher, Remi Ceillier, Stolberg, Neander, and
others. On the other hand, Baronius, Natalis Alexander, the brothers Ballerini, Mansi, and
Palma416 have sought to maintain the ecumenical character of the synod, but as early as the
seventeenth century the Roman censors condemned the direct assertions of Natalis Alexander
on the subject.</p>

<head>Introductory Note.</head>
<p>An attempt to write a commentary upon all the canons of the African Code, would have
meant nothing less than the preparation of one volume or more on the canon law of the
West. This is impossible and therefore, interesting as the field would be, I have been compelled
to restrain my pen, and rather than give a scant and insufficient annotation, I have
contented myself with providing the reader with as good a translation as I have been able
to make of the very corrupt Latin (correcting it at times by the Greek), and have added the
Ancient Epitome and the quaint notes in full of John Johnson from the Second Edition, of
1714, of his “Clergyman’s Vade-mecum,” Pt. II., which occupy little space, but may not be
easily reached by the ordinary reader. The student will find full scholia on these Canons in
Van Espen in the Latin, and in Zonaras and Balsamon in the Greek. These latter are in
Beveridge’s Synodicon.</p>
<p>Johnson writes an excellent Introduction to his Epitome of these Canons, as follows:</p>
<p>“Councils were nowhere more frequently called in the Primitive Times than in Africa.
In the year 418–19, all canons formerly made in sixteen councils held at Carthage, one at
Milevis, one at Hippo, that were approved of, were read, and received a new sanction from
a great number of bishops, then met in synod at Carthage. This Collection is the Code of
the African Church, which was always in greatest repute in all Churches next after the Code
of the Universal Church. This code was of very great authority in the old English Churches,
for many of the Excerptions of Egbert were transcribed from it. And though the Code of
the Universal Church ends with the canons of Chalcedon,417 yet these African Canons are
inserted into the Ancient Code both of the Eastern and Western Churches. These canons
though ratified and approved by a synod, yet seem to have been divided or numbered by
some private and unlearned hand, and have probably met with very unskilful transcribers,
by which means some of them are much confounded and obscured, as to their sense and
coherence. They are by Dionysius Exiguus and others entituled The Canons of the Synod
of Africa. And though all were not originally made at one time, yet they were all confirmed
by one synod of African bishops, who, after they had recited the Creed and the twenty canons
of the Council of Nice, proceeded to make new canons, and re-enforce old ones.”</p>
<p>In his “Library of Canon Law” (Bibliotheca Juris Canonici) Justellus gives these canons,
and, in my opinion, gives them rightly, the title “The Code of Canons of the African Church”
(Codex Canonum Ecclesiæ Africanæ), although Hefele418 describes them as “the collection
of those African Canons put together in 419 by Dionysius Exiguus.” Hefele says that the
<note type="footnote">417 I do not understand what Johnson means by this statement. Vide Can. j. of Chalcedon.</note>
<note type="footnote">418 Hefele. Hist. of the Councils, vol. ii., p. 468, Note 1.</note>

<pb n="851"/>
title Dionysius gave them in his collection was “The Statutes of an African Council” (Statuta
Concilii Africani) which would certainly be wholly inadequate and misleading; but in the
edition of Dionysius in Migne’s Patrologia Latina (Tom. LXVII., col. 181) in the Codex
Canonum Ecclesiasticorum no such title occurs, but the perfectly accurate one, “A Synod at
Carthage in Africa, which adopted one hundred and thirty-eight canons.” This is an exact
description of what took place and of the origin of these most important dogmatic and disciplinary
enactments. Hefele must have been thinking of Dionysius’s Preface where the
expression does occur but not as a title.</p>
<p>(Beveridge. Synodicon, Tom. II., p. 202.)</p>
<p>Carthage was formerly the head of the whole of Africa, as St. Augustine tells us in his
Epistle CLXII. From this cause it happened that a great number of councils were held there,
gathered from all the provinces of Africa. Especially while Aurelius as Archbishop was occupying
the throne were these meetings of bishops frequently holden; and by these, for the
establishing of ecclesiastical discipline in Africa, many canons were enacted. At last, after
the consulate of Honorius (XII.) and Theodosius (VIII.), Augustuses, on the eighth day
before the Calends of June, that is to say, on May 25, in the year of our Lord 419, another
Council was held in the same city at which all the canons previously adopted were considered,
and the greater part of them were again confirmed by the authority of the synod. These
canons, thus confirmed by this council, merited to be called from that day to this “The Code
of Canons of the African Church.” These canons were not at first adopted in Greek but in
Latin, and they were confirmed in the same language. This Dionysius Exiguus distinctly
testifies to in his preface to the “Code of Ecclesiastical Canons,” in which they are included.
It is uncertain when the canons of this Carthaginian synod were done into Greek. This only
is certain, that they had been translated into Greek before the Council in Trullo by which,
in its Second Canon, they were received into the Greek Nomocanon, and were confirmed
by the authority of this synod; so that from that time these canons stand in the Eastern
Church on an equality with all the rest.</p>
<p>An extremely interesting point arises as to what was the authority of the collection as a
collection, and how this collection was made? There seems no doubt that the collection
substantially as we know it was the code accepted by the Council of Trullo, the canons of
which received a quasi-ecumenical authority from the subsequent general imprimatur given
them by the Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second of Nice. Van Espen has considered
this point at great length in Dissertation VIII. of the First Part of his Commentaries, and to
his pages I must refer the reader for anything like an adequate presentation of the matter.
He concludes (§ I.) that the “Code owes its origin to this synod,” and argues against De
Marca in proof of the proposition that the collection was not the private work of Dionysius,

<pb n="852"/>
but the official work of the council by one of its officials, concluding with the remark (§ II.)
that “this was the persuasion both of Greeks and Latins,<gap reason="omitted"/>and these canons are set forth by
Balsamon with the title, ‘The Canons of the CCXVII. Blessed Fathers who met together at
Carthage.’”</p>
<p>In the notes on each canon I shall give the source, following Hefele in all respects (Hist.
of the Councils, vol. ii., pp. 468 et seqq.), and content myself here with setting down a list of
the various councils which made the enactments, with their dates.</p>

<p>After the consulate of the most glorious emperors, Honorus for the twelfth time and
Theodosius for the eighth time, Augustuses, on the VIII. before the Calends of June at
Carthage, in the Secretarium of the basilica of Faustus, when Pope Aurelius had sat down,
together with Valentine of the primatial see of the province of Numidia, and Faustinus of
the Potentine Church, of the Italian province Picenum, a legate of the Roman Church, and
also with legates of the different African provinces, that is to say, of the two Numidias, of
Byzacena, of Mauritania Cæsariensis, as well as of Tripoli, and with Vincent Colositanus,
Fortunatian, and other bishops of the proconsular province, in all two hundred and seventeen,
also with Philip and Asellus, presbyters and legates of the Roman Church, and while the
deacons were standing by, Aurelius the bishop said, etc., ut infra.</p>

Pat. Lat., Tom. LXVII.</del>; Beveridge, Synodicon in loc.)</p>
<p>Aurelius the Bishop said:420 You, most blessed brethren, remember that after the day
fixed for the synod we discussed many things while we were waiting for our brethren who
now have been sent as delegates and have arrived at the present synod, which must be placed
in the acts. Wherefore let us render thanks to our Lord for the gathering together of so great
an assembly. It remains that the acts of the Nicene Synod which we now have, and have
been determined by the fathers, as well as those things enacted by our predecessors here,
who confirmed that same Synod, or which according to the same form have been usefully
enacted by all grades of the clergy, from the highest even to the lowest, should be brought
forward. The whole Council said: Let them be brought forward.</p>
<p>Daniel the Notary read: The profession of faith or statutes of the Nicene Synod are as
follows.</p>
<p>And while he was speaking, Faustinus, a bishop of the people of Potentia, of the Italian
province of Picenum, a legate of the Roman Church said: There have been entrusted to us
by the Apostolic See certain things in writings, and certain other things as in ordinances to
be treated of with your blessedness as we have called to memory in the acts above, that is to
say, concerning the canons made at Nice, that their decrees and customs be observed; for
some things are observed out of decree and canon, but some from custom. Concerning
these things therefore in the first place let us make enquiry, if it please your blessedness; and
afterwards let the other ordinances which have been adopted or proposed be confirmed; so
that you may be able to show by your rescripts to the Apostolic See, and that you may declare
to the same venerable Pope, that we have diligently remembered these things; although the
headings of action taken had been already inserted in the acts.421 In this matter we should
act, as I have said above, as shall please your beloved blessedness. Let, therefore the commonitorium
come into the midst, that ye may be able to recognize what is contained in it,
so that an answer can be given to each point.</p>
<p>Aurelius said: Let the commonitorium be brought forward, which our brethren and
fellow-ministers lately placed in the acts, and let the rest of the things done or to be done,
follow in order.</p>
<note type="footnote">420 The reader must not complain if he finds the meaning of the translation often obscure. So great a scholar
as Hefele says of one of these speeches, “This, I believe, must be the meaning of the somewhat unintelligible
text, etc.,” and again of another passage he says that it “is even more obscure,” and that “the text is undoubtedly
corrupt. The sense is probably, etc.”</note>
<note type="footnote">421 I have followed in this passage the Greek text as a trifle less incomprehensible.</note>

<pb n="856"/>
<p>Daniel the Notary read the Commonitorium. To our brother Faustinus and to our sons,
the presbyters Philip and Asellus, Zosimus, the bishop. You well remember that we committed
to you certain businesses, and now <del>we bid you</del> carry out all things as if we ourselves
were there (for), indeed, our presence is there with you; especially since ye have this our
commandment, and the words of the canons which for greater certainty we have inserted
in this our commonitory. For thus said our brethren in the Council of Nice when they made
these decrees concerning the appeals of bishops:</p>
<p>“But it seemed good that if a bishop had been accused, etc.” <del>Here follows verbatim
Canon v. of Sardica.</del></p>
<p>Ancient Epitome.</p>
<p>If bishops shall have deposed a bishop, and if he appeal to the Roman bishop, he should
be benignantly heard, the Roman bishop writing or ordering.</p>
<p>And when this had been read, Alypius, bishop of the Tagastine Church, and legate of
the province of Numidia, said: On this matter there has been some legislation in former
sessions of our council, and we profess that we shall ever observe what was decreed by the
Nicene Council; yet I remember that when we examined the Greek copies of this Nicene
Synod, we did not find these the words quoted—Why this was the case, I am sure I do not
know. For this reason we beg your reverence, holy Pope Aurelius, that, as the authentic
record of the decrees of the Council of Nice are said to be preserved in the city of Constantinople,
you would deign to send messengers with letters from your Holiness, and not
only to our most holy brother the bishop of Constantinople, but also to the venerable bishops
of Alexandria and Antioch, who shall send to us the decrees of that council with the authentification
of their signatures, so that hereafter all ambiguity should be taken away, for we
failed to find the words cited by our brother Faustinus; notwithstanding this however we
promise to be ruled by them for a short time, as I have already said, until reliable copies
come to hand. Moreover the venerable bishop of the Roman Church, Boniface, should be
asked likewise to be good enough to send messengers to the aforementioned churches, who
should have the same copies according to his rescript, but the copies of the aforementioned
Nicene Council which we have, we place in these Acts.</p>
<p>Faustinus the bishop, legate of the Roman Church, said: Let not your holiness do dishonour
to the Roman Church, either in this matter or in any other, by saying the canons
are doubtful, as our brother and fellow-bishop Alypius has vouchsafed to say: but do you
deign to write these things to our holy and most blessed pope, so that he seeking out the
genuine canons, can treat with your holiness on all matters decreed. But it suffices that the
most blessed bishop of the city of Rome should make enquiry just as your holiness proposes
doing on your part, that there may not seem to have arisen any contention between the

<pb n="857"/>
Churches, but that ye may the rather be enabled to deliberate with fraternal charity, when
he has been heard from, what is best should be observed.</p>
<p>Aurelius the bishop said: In addition to what is set down in the acts, we, by the letters
from our insignificance, must more fully inform our holy brother and fellow-bishop Boniface
of everything which we have considered. Therefore if our plan pleases all, let us be informed
of this by the mouth of all. And the whole council said: It seems good to us.</p>
<p>Novatus the bishop, legate of Mauritania Sitifensis, said: We now call to mind that there
is contained in this commonitory something about presbyters and deacons, how they should
be tried by their own bishops or by those adjoining, a provision which we find nothing of
in the Nicene Council. For this cause let your holiness order this part to be read.</p>
<p>Aurelius the bishop said: Let the place asked for be read. Daniel the notary read as
follows: Concerning the appeals of clergymen, that is of those of inferior rank, there is a
sure answer of this very synod, concerning which thing what ye should do, we think should
be inserted, as follows:</p>
<p>“Hosius the bishop said: I should not conceal what has come into my mind up to this
time. If any bishop perchance has been quickly angered (a thing what should not happen)
and has acted quickly or sharply against a presbyter or a deacon of his, and has wished to
drive him out of the Church, provision should be made that the innocent be not condemned,
or be deprived of communion: he that has been ejected should have the right of appeal to
the bishops of the bordering dioceses, that his case should be heard, and it should be carried
on all the more diligently because to him who asks a hearing it should not be denied. And
the bishop who either justly or unjustly rejected him, should patiently allow the affair to be
discussed, so that his sentence be either approved or else emended, etc.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome.</p>
<p>A presbyter or deacon who has been cut off, has the privilege of appealing to the neighbouring
bishops. Moreover, he who cut him off should bear with equanimity the conclusion arrived
at.</p>
<p>This is the first part of Canon xiv. of Sardica, as the canon previously quoted is Canon
v. of the same synod.</p>
<p>And when this had been read, Augustine, the bishop of the Church of Hippo of the
province of Numidia, said: We promise that this shall be observed by us, provided that
upon more careful examination it be found to be of the Council of Nice. Aurelius the
bishop said. If this also is pleasing to the charity of you all, give it the confirmation of your
vote. The whole Council said: Everything that has been ordained by the Nicene Council

<pb n="858"/>
pleases us all. Jocundus, the bishop of the Church of Suffitula, legate of the province of
Byzacena, said: What was decreed by the Nicene Council cannot in any particular be violated.</p>
<p>Faustinus the bishop, legate of the Roman Church, said: So far as has developed by the
confession of your holiness as well as of the holy Alypius, and of our brother Jocundus, I
believe that some of the points have been made weak and others confirmed, which should
not be the case, since even the very canons themselves have been brought into question.
Therefore, that there may be harmony between us and your blessedness, let your holiness
deign to refer the matter to the holy and venerable bishop of the Roman Church, that he
may be able to consider whether what St. Augustine vouchsafed to enact, should be conceded
or not, I mean in the matter of appeals of the inferior grade. If therefore there still is doubt,
on this head it is right that the bishop of the most blessed see be informed, if this can be
found in the canons which have been approved.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome.</p>
<p>Since the written decrees of the Nicene Council have not been found, let the Roman bishop
deign to write to the bishop of Constantinople and to him of Alexandria, and let us know what
he receives from them.</p>
<p>Aurelius the bishop said: As we have suggested to your charity, pray allow the copies
of the statutes of the Nicene Council to be read and inserted in the acts, as well as those
things what have been most healthfully defined in this city by our predecessors, according
to the rule of that council, and those which now have been ordained by us. And the whole
council said: The copies of the Creed, and the statutes of the Nicene Synod which formerly
were brought to our council through Cæcilean of blessed memory, the predecessor of your
holiness (who was present at it), as well as the copies of the decrees made by the Fathers in
this city following them, or which now we have decreed by our common consultation, shall
remain inserted in these ecclesiastical acts, so that (as has been already said) your blessedness
may vouchsafe to write to those most venerable men of the Church of Antioch, and of that
of Alexandria, and also of that of Constantinople, that they would send most accurate copies
of the decrees of the Council of Nice under the authentification of their signatures, by which,
the truth of the matter having become evident, those chapters which in the commonitory
our brother who is present, and fellow-bishop Faustinus, as well as our fellow-presbyters
Philip and Asellus brought with them, if they be found therein, may be confirmed by us; or
if they be not found, we will hold a synod and consider the matter further. Daniel the notary
read the profession of faith of the Council of Nice and its statutes to the African Council.</p>
<p>The Profession of Faith of the Nicene Council.</p>
<p>We believe in one God, etc.,…and in the Holy Ghost. But those who say, etc.,<gap reason="omitted"/>anathematize
them.</p>

<p>The statutes also of the Nicene Council in twenty heads were likewise read, as are found
written before. Then what things were promulgated in the African Synods, were inserted
in the present acts.</p>

adopted and confirmed by us, be kept firm.</p>

<p>It is certain that Cæcilian, then Bishop of Carthage, was present at the Council of Nice;
that any other African bishop was there does not appear; but probably he was attended with
several clergyman, who were afterwards ordained bishops.</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>Of Preaching the Trinity.</p>
<p>The whole Council said: By the favour of God, by a unanimous confession the Church’s
faith which through us is handed down should be confessed in this glorious assembly before
anything else; then the ecclesiastical order of each is to be built up and strengthened by the
consent of all. That the minds of our brethren and fellow bishops lately elevated may be
strengthened, those things should be propounded which we have certainly received from
our fathers, as the unity of the Trinity, which we retain consecrated in our senses, of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which has no difference, as we say,422 so we
shall instruct the people of God. Moreover by all the bishops lately promoted it was said:
So we openly confess, so we hold, so we teach, following the Evangelic faith and your
teaching.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>

<p>No difference is recognised or taught by the decrees of the Council of Nice between the

<p>Of Continence.</p>
<p>Aurelius the bishop said: When at the past council the matter on continency and chastity
was considered, those three grades, which by a sort of bond are joined to chastity by their
consecration, to wit bishops, presbyters, and deacons, so it seemed that it was becoming
that the sacred rulers and priests of God as well as the Levites, or those who served at the
divine sacraments, should be continent altogether, by which they would be able with
singleness of heart to ask what they sought from the Lord: so that what the apostles taught
and antiquity kept, that we might also keep.</p>

<p>Of the different orders that should abstain from their wives.</p>
<p>Faustinus, the bishop of the Potentine Church, in the province of Picenum, a legate of
the Roman Church, said: It seems good that a bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon, or whoever
perform the sacraments, should be keepers of modesty and should abstain from their wives.</p>

<head>Canon V.</head>
<p>Of Avarice.</p>
<p>Aurelius, the bishop, said: The cupidity of avarice (which, let no one doubt, is the
mother of all evil things), is to be henceforth prohibited, lest anyone should usurp another’s
limits, or for gain should pass beyond the limits fixed by the fathers, nor shall it be at all
lawful for any of the clergy to receive usury of any kind. And those new edicts (suggestiones)
which are obscure and generally ambiguous, after they have been examined by us, will have
their value fixed (formam accipiunt); but with regard to those upon which the Divine
Scripture hath already most plainly given judgment, it is unnecessary that further sentence
should be pronounced, but what is already laid down is to be carried out. And what is reprehensible
in laymen is worthy of still more severe censure in the clergy. The whole synod
said: No one hath gone contrary to what is said in the Prophets and in the Gospels with
impunity.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</p>
<p>As the taking of any kind of usury is condemned in laymen, much more is it condemned
in clergymen.</p>
<p>This canon is made up of Canons x. and xiij. of the Synod of Carthage held under Gratus
in a.d. 345–348. This synod was held to return thanks for the ending of the Donatist schism;
and indeed for some time the evil did seem to have been removed. Donatist worship was
prohibited by the imperial law and it was not until the times of Constans and Constantius
that it again openly asserted itself. The synod while in session also took advantage of the
opportunity of passing some useful general canons on discipline.</p>

<head>Canon VI.</head>
<p>That the chrism should not be made by presbyters.</p>
<p>Fortunatus the bishop, said: In former councils we remember that it was decreed that
the chrism or the reconciliation of penitents, as also the consecration of virgins be not done
by presbyters: but should anyone be discovered to have done this, what ought we to decree
with regard to him?</p>
<p>Aurelius the bishop said: Your worthiness has heard the suggestion of our brother and
fellow-bishop Fortunatus; What answer will you give?</p>
<p>And all the bishops replied: Neither the making of the chrism, nor the consecration of
virgins, is to be done by presbyters, nor is it permitted to a presbyter to reconcile anyone in
the public mass (in publica missa), this is the pleasure of all of us.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>Let no presbyter make the chrism, nor prepare the unction, nor consecrate virgins, nor
publicly reconcile anyone to communion.</p>
<p>This is Canon iij. of the Carthaginian Synod under Genethlius, a.d. 387 or 390.</p>
<p>Johnson.</p>
<p>Not the chrism used upon persons at their baptism, says the scholion in Bishop
Beveridge’s Annotation, but the Mystical Chrism, viz., that used at Confirmation; though
neither was the chrism used at baptism to be consecrated by Priests. See Decr. of Gelasius
6.</p>
<p>Du Pin observes, That this is one of the first monuments where the name of “mass”
occurs to signify the public prayers, which the church made at offering the Eucharist. And
let the reader observe, that there is no mention of the “mass” in the copies which the Greeks
made use of. And further, he restrains the meaning of the word “mass” too much, when he
supposes that it denoted the Communion Office only.</p>

<p>Concerning those who are reconciled in peril of death.</p>
<p>Aurelius the bishop said: If anyone had fallen into peril of death during the absence of
the bishop, and had sought to reconcile himself to the divine altars, the presbyter should
consult the bishop, and so reconcile the sick man at his bidding, which thing we should
strengthen with healthy counsel. By all the bishops it was said: Whatever your holiness has
taught us to be necessary, that is our pleasure.</p>

<p>Numidius, the bishop of Maxula, said: Moreover, there are very many, not of good life,
who think that their elders or bishops should be the butt for accusation; ought such to be
easily admitted or no? Aurelius the bishop said: Is it the pleasure of your charity that he
who is ensnared by divers wickednesses should have no voice of accusation against these?</p>
<p>All the bishops said: If he is criminous, his accusation is not to be received.</p>

pride, has thought fit to offer sacrifices to God separately <del>from the authority of the bishop</del>
or has believed it right to erect another altar, contrary to ecclesiastical faith and discipline,
such should not get off with impunity. Valentine, of the primatial see of the province of

shall despise the synod and separate himself from the Church, and shall set up another altar,

may be reconciled to his bishop: but if he shall not have done this, but, puffed up with pride,
(which may God forbid!) he shall have thought it proper to separate himself from the com-
munion of his bishop, and separately shall have offered the sacrifice to God, and made a
schism with certain accomplices, let him be anathema, and let him lose his place; and if the

<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</p>
<p>When a bishop is to be tried, if the whole synod does not sit, let at least twelve bishops

<p>Hereby must be meant African canons; that under Gratus <del>a.d. 348</del> had decreed the

<p>Who was the bishop’s judge at the first instance does not appear by this canon; but it is
natural to suppose it was the Primate. It is probable that this canon is to be understood of
hearing upon an appeal, because it is certain that a priest’s cause, at the first instance, was
to be tried before the bishop (see Can. 10, 11). And therefore the latter part of the canon
can be understood of no hearing but by way of appeal, nor by consequence the former. And

he may be ordained by three.</p>
<p>Bishop Aurelius said: What says your holiness on this matter? By all the bishops it was
answered: The decrees of the ancients must be observed by us, to wit, that without the
consent of the Primate of any province even many bishops assembled together should not
lightly presume to ordain a bishop. But should there be a necessity, at his bidding, three
bishops should ordain him in any place they happen to be, and if anyone contrary to his
profession and subscription shall come into any place he shall thereby deprive himself of
his honour.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>

<p>At the bidding of the Primate even three bishops can make a bishop. But whoever goes
counter to his profession, and subscription, is deprived of his honour by his own judgment.

<p>That one of the bishops of Tripoli should come as legate, and that a presbyter might be

<p>It also seemed good that one bishop from Tripoli, on account of the poverty of the

bishops, and a deacon by three, as has been noted above, his own bishop presiding.</p>

<head>Canon XV.</head>
<p>Of the divers orders who serve the Church, that if any one fall into a criminal business
and refused to be tried by the ecclesiastical court, he ought to be in danger therefor; and that
the sons of bishops (sacerdotum) are not to attend worldly shows.</p>
<p>Moreover it seemed good that if any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, who had a criminal
charge brought against him or who had a civil cause, refused to be tried by the ecclesiastical
tribunal, but wished to be judged by the secular courts, even if he won his suit, nevertheless
he should lose his office.</p>
<p>This is the law in a criminal suit; but in a civil suit he shall lose that for the recovery of
which he instituted the proceedings, if he wishes to retain his office.</p>
<p>This also seemed good, that if from some ecclesiastical judges an appeal was taken to
other ecclesiastical judges who had a superior jurisdiction, this should in no way injure the
reputation of those from whom the appeal was taken, unless it could be shown that they
had given sentence moved by hatred or some other mental bias, or that they had been in
some way corrupted. But if by the consent of both parties judges had been chosen, even if
they were fewer in number than is specified, no appeal can be taken.</p>
<p>And <del>it seemed good</del> that the sons of bishops should not take part in nor witness secular
spectacles. For this has always been forbidden to all Christians, so let them abstain from
them, that they may not go where cursing and blasphemy are to be found.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.</p>
<p>A bishop or cleric who has a criminal suit brought against him, if he leaves the Church
and betakes himself to secular judges even if he had been unjustly used, shall lose his rank.
And if he was successful in his political affairs, if he follows this, he shall lose his own grade.
No appeal can be taken from the ecclesiastical judges, except they be proved to have given their
decision beforehand moved thereto by a bribe or by hatred. No appeal can be taken from the
decision of judges chosen by each side.</p>

<p>If any cleric is ordained he ought to be admonished to observe the constitutions.
And that neither the Eucharist nor Baptism should be given to the bodies of the dead.
And that every year in every province the Metropolitans come together in synod.</p>
<p>(Gk. Canon xix.)</p>
<p>It seemed good that before bishops, or clerics were ordained, the provisions of the canons
should be brought to their notice, lest, they might afterwards repent of having through ignorance

<p>The things which have been adopted by the synods should be made known to him who is

<p>(Gk. Canon xx.)</p>
<p>It also seemed good that the Eucharist should not be given to the bodies of the dead.
For it is written: “Take, Eat,” but the bodies of the dead can neither “take” nor “eat.” Nor
let the ignorance of the presbyters baptize those who are dead.</p>

<p>The Eucharist is not to be given to the body of one dead for it neither eats nor drinks.</p>
<p>The ignorance of a presbyter shall not baptize a dead man.</p>

<p>And therefore in this holy synod should be confirmed in accordance with the Nicene
decrees, on account of Ecclesiastical causes, which often are delayed to the injury of the
people, that every year there should be a synod, to which all, who are primates of the
provinces, should send bishops as legates, from their own synods, two or as many as they

<p>The 18th canon in the Edition of Tilius and Bishop Beveridge runs thus; viz. <del>If any

in synod yearly.</del> They speak their own language, and call him a Metropolitan, whom the
Africans called a Primate; but then they have also the entire 18th canon, as it here stands
according to the Latin, which they divide into three, and number them 19, 20, 21.</p>
<p>See Can. Nic. 5. It seems very odd that they should allege the authority of the Nicene

<p>That if any bishop is accused the cause should be brought before the primate of his own
province.</p>
<p>Aurelius, the bishop, said: Whatever bishop is accused the accuser shall bring the case
before the primates of the province to which the accused belongs, and he shall not be suspended
from communion by reason of the crime laid to his charge unless he fails to put in
an appearance on the appointed day for arguing his cause before the chosen judges, having
been duly summoned by the letters; that is, within the space of one month from the day in
which he is found to have received the letters. But should he be able to prove any true necessity
which manifestly rendered it impossible for him to appear, he shall have the oppor-
tunity of arguing his case within another full month; but after the second month he shall
not communicate until he is acquitted.</p>
<p>But if he is not willing to come to the annual general council, so that his cause may there
be terminated, he himself shall be judged to have pronounced the sentence of his own condemnation
at the time in which he does not communicate, nor shall he communicate either
in his own church or diocese.</p>
<p>But his accuser, if he has not missed any of the days for pleading the cause, shall not be
shut out from communion; but if he has missed some of them, withdrawing himself, then
the bishop shall be restored to communion and the accuser shall be removed from communion;
so, nevertheless, that the possibility of going on with the case be not taken from him,
if he shall prove that his absence was caused by lack of power and not by lack of will.</p>
<p>And this is enacted, that if the accuser turn out to be himself a criminal when the case
against the bishop has come to argument, he shall not be allowed to testify unless he asserts
that the causes are personal and not ecclesiastical.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</p>
<p>A bishop accused and haled to judgment shall have the space of two months; if there is
any excuse426 for his delay from the other side. But after this he shall be excommunicated if

be deprived of communion. But the accuser who is infamous shall not be an accuser at all.</p>

<p>Concerning bishops and the lower orders who wait upon the most holy mysteries. It has

that what had been enacted in divers councils should be confirmed, to wit, that subdeacons
who wait upon the holy mysteries, and deacons, and presbyters, as well as bishops according
to former statutes,427 should contain from their wives, so that they should be as though they
had them not and unless they so act, let them be removed from office. But the rest of the
clergy are not to be compelled to this, unless they be of mature age. And by the whole
council it was said: What your holiness has said is just, holy, and pleasing to God, and we
confirm it.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.</p>
<p>Those who handle holy things should abstain even from their own wives at the times of
their ministration.</p>
<p>This is founded upon Canon iv. of the Council of Carthage, which met September 13th,

to continence.</p>

Secundum propria statuta.</p>

<p>Clerics who have been condemned, if they take exception to the judgment, shall not appeal
beyond seas, but to the neighbouring bishops, and to their own; if they do otherwise let them
be excommunicated in Africa.</p>
<p>This canon is the same as Canon xvij. of the Synod of Carthage of 418, but it has some
words with regard to appeals which that canon does not contain, viz.: “Aut ad universale
conciliam, sicut et de episcopis sæpe constitutum est.” This clause, affirming that bishops
have often been forbidden to appeal across the water from the decisions of the African
bishops, has caused great perplexity as no such decrees are extant. The Ballerini, to avoid
this difficulty, and possibly for other reasons, suggest an entirely different meaning to the
passage, and suppose that it means that “bishops have often been allowed to appeal to the
Universal Council and now this privilege is extended to priests.”431 But this would seem
to be a rather unnatural interpretation and Van Espen in his Commentary shews good
reason for adopting the more evident view.</p>

<p>It is most probable that this canon is to be understood of deacons designed by the
bishop to be ordained priests, for the deacons, at least in some Churches, were provided of
a better maintenance than priests; or it may be understood of inferior clergymen, who were
permitted to marry in the degree they were now in, but would not willingly take the order
of priest or deacon, because then they were prohibited marriage.</p>

when they were ordained had no possessions, and in the time of their episcopate or after
they became clerics, shall purchase in their own names lands or any other property, shall
be held guilty of the crime of intrenching upon the Lord’s goods, unless, when they are admonished
to do so, they place the same at the disposal of the Church. But should anything
come to them personally by the liberality of anyone, or by succession from some relative,
let them do what they will with it; if, however, they demand it back again, contrary to what
they proposed, they shall be judged unworthy of ecclesiastical honour as back-sliders.</p>

<p>In this canon there is difficulty about the meaning of the phrase “quod eorum proposito
congruat.” Hardouin suggests that “propositum” is the same as “profession,” or “calling,”
and the meaning, were this the case, would be that he must employ it as befits his clerical
calling. Van Espen follows Balsamon and Zonaras in understanding it to mean that if he
has proposed to employ a part for the Church or for the poor, and changes his mind, he is
to be deposed; and this meaning I have followed.</p>

anticipated the time and day of the council; also it was read by our brethren Honoratus and

to custom to this council; but this it seems they did not do at all, the legates of Mauritania
Sitifensis, who had come so great a distance gave notice that they could stay no longer; and,
therefore, brethren, if it seem good to your charity, let the letters of our Byzacene brethren,

<p>From this canon and the 29th of Trullo, it is evident that by the Lord’s Supper, the ancients
understood the supper going before the Eucharist, and not the Eucharist itself, and
that on Maunday-Thursday442 yearly, before the Eucharist, they had such a public entertainment
in imitation of our Saviour’s last Paschal Supper. I refer it to the consideration of the
learned reader, whether St. Paul, by the Δεῖπνον κυριακὸν, 1 Cor. xi. 20, does not mean this
entertainment. For the obvious translation of that verse is, “It is not your <del>duty or business</del>
when you meet together [in the church] to eat the Lord’s Supper.” He would not have them
to eat this supper in the public assembly: “For” (says he) “have ye not houses to eat and
drink in, or despise ye the Church of God?” From the 4th age forward, the Eucharist was
sometimes called the Lord’s Supper; but from the beginning it was not so. And even after
it did sometimes pass by this name, yet at other times this name was strictly used for the
previous entertainment, as may be seen by this canon, which was made in the 4th century.
Further it seems probable, that the Lord’s Supper and the Love-feast was the same, though
it was not usually called the Lord’s Supper; but only (perhaps) that love-feast, which was
made on the day of the institution of the Eucharist, which we now call Maundy-Thursday.</p>

<p>Concerning <del>the Donatists and447</del> the children baptized by the Donatists.</p>
<p>Concerning the Donatists448 it seemed good that we should hold counsel with our
brethren and fellow priests Siricius and Simplician concerning those infants alone who are
baptized by Donatists:449 lest what they did not do of their own will, when they should be
converted to the Church of God with a salutary determination, the error of their parents
might prevent their promotion to the ministry of the holy altar.</p>
<p>But when these things had been begun, Honoratus and Urbanus, bishops of Mauritania
Sitifensis, said: When some time ago we were sent to your holiness, we laid aside what
things had been written on this account, that we might wait for the arrival of our brethren
the legates from Numidia. But because not a few days have passed in which they have been
looked for and as yet they are not arrived, it is not fitting that we should delay any longer
the commands we received from our brother-bishops; and therefore, brethren, receive our
story with alacrity of mind. We have heard concerning the faith of the Nicene tractate:
True it is that sacrifices are to be forbidden after breakfast, so that they may be offered as is
right by those who are fasting, and this has been confirmed then and now.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVII.</p>
<p>When those in infancy baptized by Donatists are converted, this shall be no impediment

<p>The pretence that the Donatists had for making a schism was, that Cæcilian, Bishop of
Carthage, had, in the time of persecution, been a Traditor, i.e., given up the Bible to the
heathen inquisitors; this was denied by the Orthodox, who charged them with the same
crime in effect, viz. of being too favourable to the Traditors, and those that had lapsed. They

<p>Of rebaptisms, reordinations, and translations of bishops.</p>
<p>But we suggest that we decree what was set forth by the wisdom of the plenary synod
at Capua, that no rebaptisings, nor reordinations should take place, and that bishops should
not be translated. For Cresconius, bishop of Villa Regis, left his own people and invaded
the Church of Tubinia and having been admonished down to this very day, to leave, according
to the decree, the diocese he had invaded, he treated the admonition with disdain. We have
heard that the sentence pronounced against him has been confirmed; but we seek, according
to our decree, that ye deign to grant that being driven thereto by necessity, it be free to us
to address the rector of the province against him, according to the statutes of the most
glorious princes, so that whoever is not willing to acquiesce in the mild admonition of your
holiness and to amend his lawlessness, shall be immediately cast out by judicial authority.
Aurelius the bishop said: By the observance of the constituted form, let him not be judged
to be a member of the synod, if he has been asked by you, dear brethren, to depart and has
refused: for out of his own contempt and contumacy he has fallen to the power of the secular
magistrate.450 Honoratus and Urban the bishops said: This pleases us all, does it not? And
all the bishops answered: It is just, it pleases us.</p>

<head>Canon XLIX. (Greek liii.)</head>
<p>How many bishops there should be to ordain a bishop.</p>
<p>Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said: We have issued this command, that (because
lately two of our brethren, bishops of Numidia, presumed to ordain a pontiff,) only by the
concurrence of twelve bishops the ordination of bishops be celebrated. Aurelius, the bishop,
said: The ancient form shall be preserved, that not less than three suffice who shall have
been designated for ordaining the bishop. Moreover, because in Tripoli, and in Arzug the
barbarians are so near, for it is asserted that in Tripoli there are but five bishops, and out of
that number two may be occupied by some necessity; but it is difficult that all of the number
should come together at any place whatever; ought this circumstance to be an impediment
to the doing of what is of utility to the Church? For in this Church, to which your holiness
has deigned to assemble451 we frequently have ordinations and nearly every Lord’s day;
could I frequently summon twelve, or ten, or about that number of bishops? But it is an
easy thing for me to join a couple of neighbours to my littleness. Wherefore your charity
will agree with me that this cannot be observed.</p>

<p>The occasion of this canon was a complaint that two bishops in Numidia had presumed
to ordain a third; upon which it was proposed that not less than twelve should perform this
office: But Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, desires that the old form might be observed, and
three bishops be sufficient; especially, because in Tripoli, where there were but five bishops
in all, it would be hard to get more than three together. And he adds, that though it were
no hard matter for him to get two bishops to assist him in his ordinations at Carthage, yet
it would not be practicable for him to get twelve: “For,” says he, “we have frequently, and
almost every Sunday, men to be ordained.” He must mean bishops for otherwise it had
been nothing to his purpose, because he could ordain priests or deacons by himself, without
the assistance of other bishops: and yet it is very strange, that ordinations of bishops should
<note type="footnote">451 Notice the African use of the phrase, convenire ad.</note>

<pb n="916"/>
be so frequent as to bear that expression of “almost every Sunday.” There were indeed above
one hundred bishoprics in his Province; but these could not occasion above six or eight ordinations
in a year; but it is probable that the privilege belonging to him, Can. 55, brought
very many ordinations to the church of Carthage; for it is evident, there was a great scarcity
of men fit for the Episcopal office in Africa. It is further evident from this canon, that
bishops were not ordained in the church of their own see, but in that of the Primate. See

<p>Here the bishops meet to choose a new one, and it is evident by the foregoing canon,
that they met not in the vacant church, but in that of the Primate; and that therefore not

objections, which supposes they knew who their intended bishop was; but the bishops were
the judges of the cause. And it seems probable, that if there were any dispute, some of the
bishops went to the vacant church to hear the allegations against the person that was elected,
or proposed.</p>

have drawn up, you should visit the province of Mauritania.</p>

confines of Africa, we have made no decree, for they are neighbours of the barbarians; but
God grant (not however that I make any rash promise of doing so), we may be able to come
to your province. For ye should consider, brethren, that this same thing our brethren of

<head>Canon LIII. (Greek lvii.)</head>
<p>That dioceses should not receive a bishop except by the consent of its own bishop.</p>
<p>Epigonius, the bishop, said: In many councils it has been decreed by the sacerdotal assembly
that such communities as are contained in other dioceses and ruled by their bishops,
and which never had any bishops of their own, should not receive rulers, that is bishops,
for themselves except with the consent of the bishop under whose jurisdiction they have
been. But because some who have attained a certain domination abhor the communion of
the brethren, or at least, having become depraved, claim for themselves domination with
what is really tyranny, for the most part tumid and stolid presbyters, who lift up their heads
against their own bishops or else win the people to themselves by feasting them or by malignant
persuasion, that they may by unlawful favour wish to place themselves as rulers over
them; we indeed hold fast that glorious desire of your mind, most pious brother Aurelius,
for thou hast often opposed these things, paying no heed to such petitioners; but on account
of their evil thoughts and basely conceived designs this I say, that such a community, which
has always been subject in a diocese, ought not to receive a rector, nor should it ever have
a bishop of its own. Therefore if this which I have proposed seems good to the whole most
holy council, let it be confirmed.</p>
<p>Aurelius, the bishop, said: I am not in opposition to the proposition of our brother and
fellow bishop: but I confess that this has been and shall be my practice concerning those
who were truly of one mind, not only with regard to the Church of Carthage, but concerning
every sacerdotal assemblage. For there are many who, as has been said, conspire with the
people whom they deceive, tickling their ears and blandly seducing them, men of vicious
lives, or at least puffed up and separated from this meeting, who think to watch over their
own people, and never come to our council for fear that their wickedness should be discussed.
I say, if it seems good, that not only should these not keep their dioceses, but that every effort
should be made to have them expelled by public authority from that church of theirs which
has evilly favoured them, and that they be removed even from the chief sees. For it is right
that he who cleaves to all the brethren and the whole council, should possess with full right
not only his church but also the dioceses. But they who think that the people suffice them
and spurn the love of the brethren, shall not only lose their dioceses, but (as I have said,)
they shall be deprived by public authority of their own cures as rebels. Honoratus and
Urban, the bishops, said: The lofty provision of your holiness obtains the adherence of the
minds of all of us, and I think that by the answer of all what you have deigned to propose
will be confirmed. All the bishops said: Placet, placet.</p>

<p>That a strange cleric is under no circumstances to be received by another.</p>
<p>Epigonius, the bishop, said: This has been decreed in many councils, also just now it
has been confirmed by your prudence, most blessed brethren, that no bishop should receive
a strange cleric into his diocese without the consent of the bishop to whose jurisdiction the
cleric belongs. But I say that Julian, who is ungrateful for the layouts bestowed upon him
by God through my littleness, is so rash and audacious, that a certain man who was baptized
by me, when he was a most needy boy, commended to me by the same, and when for many
years he had been fed and reared by me, it is certain that this one, as I have said, was baptized
in my church, by my own unworthy hands; this same man began to exercise the office of
reader in the Mappalien diocese, and read there for nearly two years, with a most incomprehensible
contempt of my littleness, the aforenamed Julian took this man, whom he declared
to be a citizen of his own city Vazarita, and without consulting me ordained him deacon.
If, most blessed brethren, that is permissible, let it be declared to us; but if not, let such an
impudent one be restrained that he may in no way mix himself in someone’s communion.</p>
<p>Numidius, the bishop, said: If, as it seems, Julian did this without your worthiness being
asked for his consent, nor even consulted, we all judge that this was done iniquitously and
unworthily. Wherefore unless Julian shall correct his error, and shall return the cleric to
your people with proper satisfaction, since what he did was contrary to the decrees of the
council, let him be condemned and separated from us on account of his contumacy. Epigonius,
the bishop, said: Our father in age, and most ancient by his promotion, that laudable
man, our brother and colleague Victor wishes that this petition should be made general to
all.</p>

<head>Canon LV. (Greek lix.)</head>
<p>That it be lawful for the bishop of Carthage to ordain a cleric whenever he wishes.</p>
<p>Aurelius, the bishop, said: My brethren, pray allow me to speak. It often happens that
ecclesiastics who are in need seek deacons [præpositis in the Latin], or presbyters or bishops
from me: and I, bearing in mind what things have been ordained these I observe, to wit, I
summon the bishop of the cleric who is sought for, and I shew him the state of affairs, how
that they of a certain church ask for a certain one of his clergy. Perchance then they make
no objection, but lest it happen that afterwards they might object when in this case they
shall have been demanded (postulati) by me, who (as you know) have the care of many
churches and of the ordinands. It is right therefore that I should summon a fellow bishop
with two or three witnesses from our number. But if he be found indevotus <del>ἀκαθοσίωτος</del>,
what does your charity think should be done? For I, as ye know, brethren, by the condescension
of God have the care of all the churches.</p>
<p>Numidius, the bishop, said:455 This see always had the power of ordaining a bishop
according to the desire of each Church as he wills and on whose name there was agreement
(fuisset conventus). Epigonius, the bishop, said: Your good nature makes small use of your
powers, for you make much less use of them than you might, since, my brother, you are
good and gentle to all; for you have the power, but it is far from your practice to satisfy the
person of each bishop in prima tantummodo conventione. But if it should be thought that
the rights of this see ought to be vindicated, you have the duty of supporting all the churches,
wherefore we do not give thee power, but we confirm that power thou hast, viz.: that thou
hast the right at thy will always to choose whom thou wilt, to constitute456 prelates over
peoples and churches who shall have asked thee to do so, and when thou so desirest.
Posthumianus, the bishop, said: Would it be right that he who had only one presbyter
should have that one taken away from him? Aurelius, the bishop, said: But there may be
one bishop by whom many presbyters can be made through the divine goodness, but one
fit to be made bishop is found with difficulty. Wherefore if any bishop has a presbyter necessary
for the episcopate and has one only, my brother, as you have said, even that one he
ought to give up for promotion. Posthumianus, the bishop, said: If some other bishop has
plenty of clergy, should that other diocese come to my help? Aurelius, the bishop, said: Of
course, when you have come to the help of another Church, he who has many clerics should
be persuaded to make one over to you for ordination.</p>
<note type="footnote">455 The meaning of this whole canon is very obscure, the text is almost certainly corrupt; and the Greek in

<p>It is lawful for the bishop of Carthage, whenever he wills, to choose those who are to be

<p>This canon is the first half of Canon vij. of the Council of Carthage held August 28th
a.d. 397.</p>
<p>Johnson.</p>
<p>It is evident, that this privilege of the Bishop of Carthage extended to the whole African
diocese or the six provinces of Africa, which contained near five hundred bishoprics. This
was what caused such frequent ordinations of bishops in the Church of Carthage (See Can.
Afr. 49, and the Note). And it is further apparent, that the Bishop of Carthage had some
power over the whole African church, and was probably their visitor (See Can. 52). But that
he had the sole power of ordaining bishops for every church, with the assistance of any two
bishops, does not appear, though Justellus is of this opinion; nay, the 49th canon proves
that he had it not.</p>

<p>That bishops who were ordained for dioceses shall not choose for themselves dioceses <del>in

<p>Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said: We have heard that it has been decreed that
dioceses should not be deemed fit to receive bishops, unless with the consent of their founder:
but in our province since some have been ordained bishops in the diocese, by the consent
of that bishop by whose power they were established, have even seized dioceses for themselves,
this should be corrected by the judgment of your charity, and prohibited for the future.
Epigonius, the bishop, said: To every bishop should be reserved what is right, so that from
the mass of dioceses no part should be snatched away, so as to have its own bishop, without
consent from the proper authority. For it shall suffice, if the consent be given, that the
diocese thus set apart have its own bishop only, and let him457 not seize other dioceses, for
only the one cut off from the many merited the honour of receiving a bishop. Aurelius, the
bishop, said: I do not doubt that it is pleasing to the charity of you all, that he who was ordained
for a diocese by the consent of the bishop who held the mother see, should retain
only the people for whom he was ordained. Since therefore I think that everything has been
treated of, if all things are agreeable to your mind, pray confirm them all by your suffrage.
All the bishops said: We all are well pleased, and we have confirmed them with our subscription.
And they signed their names.</p>
<p>I, Aurelius, bishop of the Church of Carthage, have consented to this decree, and have
subscribed what has been read. So too did all the other bishops in like fashion sign.</p>

<p>It had scarce been worth while to give so much of this canon in English if I had not

<p>Between this canon and the following, there is a reference to a former council at Carthage
forbidding bishops to sail, without a formal letter from the Primate; and this said to be done
when Cæsarius and Atticus were consuls, anno æræ vulg. 397, and there is mention of an
embassy of two bishops from a council of Carthage to the Emperors, to procure the privilege
of sanctuary to all impeached for any crime, if they fled to the Church. This is said to be
done when Honorius and Eutychianus were consuls, anno æræ vulg. 398. And further, here
is an account of a bishop sent legate to Anastasius, Bishop of the Apostolical see, and Venerius
of Milan, to supply the African Church with men fit to be ordained. For Aurelius
complains that many Churches have not so much as one man, not so much as an illiterate
one, in deacon’s orders, much less had they a competent number of men for the superior
dignities. He speaks of the importunate clamours of many people, that were themselves
almost killed, I suppose, by some common pestilence.</p>
<p>In this council it was decreed that bishops should not travel by sea without formed letters.</p>
<p>During the consulate of those illustrious men, Cæsar and Atticus, on the sixth before
the Calends of July, at Carthage, it seemed good that no bishop should travel by water
without “formed letters” from the Primate. The authentic acts will be found by him who
seeks them.</p>
<p>In this council, bishops whose names are set down hereafter were sent as legates to the
Emperor.</p>
<p>After the consulate of the most glorious Emperor Honorius Augustus for the fourth
time, and of the renowned Eutychian, on the fifth of the calends of May, at Carthage in the
secretarium of the restored basilica. In this council Epigonius and Vincent, the bishops,
received a legation, in order that they might obtain a law from the most glorious princes in
behalf of those taking refuge in the Church, whatever might be the crime of which they were
accused, that no one should dare to force them away.</p>
<p>In this council a legation was sent to the Bishops of Rome and Milan with regard to children
baptized by heretics, and to the Emperor with regard to having such idols as still remained
taken away, and also with regard to many other matters.</p>
<p>After the consulate of the renowned Flabius Stilico, on the sixteenth of the calends of
July, at Carthage in the secretarium of the restored basilica.</p>
<p>When Aurelius, the Bishop, together with his fellow-bishops had taken their seats, the
deacons standing by, Aurelius, the Bishop, said: Your charity, most holy brethren, knows
fully as well as I do the necessities of the churches of God throughout Africa. And since the
Lord has vouchsafed that from a part of your holy company this present assembly should
be convened, it seems to me that these necessities which in the discharge of our solicitude

<pb n="927"/>
we have discovered, we ought to consider together. And afterwards, that there should be
chosen a bishop from our number who may, with the help of the Lord and your prayers,
assume the burden of these necessities, and zealously accomplish whatever ought to be done
in the premises, going to the parts of Italy across seas, that he may acquaint our holy brethren
and fellow-bishops, the venerable and holy brother Anastasius, bishop of the Apostolic see,
and also our holy brother Venerius the Bishop of Milan, with our necessity and grief, and
helplessness. For there has been withheld from these sees the knowledge of what was necessary
to provide against the common peril, especially that the need of clergy is so great that
many churches are in such destitution as that not so much as a single deacon or even an
unlettered clerk is to be found. I say nothing of the superior orders and offices, because if,
as I have said, the ministry of a deacon is not easily to be had, it is certainly much more
difficult to find one of the superior orders. <del>And let them also tell these bishops</del> that we
can no longer bear to hear the daily lamentations of the different peoples almost ready to
die, and unless we do our best to help them, the grievous and inexcusable cause of the destruction
of innumerable souls will be laid at our door before God.</p>

<p>That persons baptized when children by the Donatists may be ordained clergymen in the
Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Since in the former council it was decreed, as your unanimity remembers as well as I
do, that those who as children were baptized by the Donatists, and not yet being able to
know the pernicious character of their error, and afterward when they had come to the use
of reason, had received the knowledge of the truth, abhorred their former error, and were
received, (in accordance with the ancient order) by the imposition of the hand, into the
Catholic Church of God spread throughout the world, that to such the remembrance of the
error ought to be no impediment to the reception of the clerical office. For in coming to
faith they thought the true Church to be their own and there they believed in Christ, and
received the sacraments of the Trinity. And that all these sacraments are altogether true
and holy and divine is most certain, and in them the whole hope of the soul is placed, although
the presumptuous audacity of heretics, taking to itself the name of the truth, dares
to administer them. They are but one after all, as the blessed Apostle tells us, saying: “One
God, one faith, one baptism,” and it is not lawful to reiterate what once only ought to be
administered. [Those therefore who have been so baptized] having anathematized their
error may be received by the imposition of the hand into the one Church, the pillar as it is
called, and the one mother of all Christians, where all these Sacraments are received unto
salvation and everlasting life; even the same sacraments which obtain for those persevering
in heresy the heavy penalty of damnation. So that which to those who are in the truth
lighteneth to the obtaining of eternal life, the same to them who are in error tends but to
darkness and damnation. With regard then to those who, having fled from error, acknowledge
the breasts of their mother the Catholic Church, who believe and receive all these holy
mysteries with the love of the truth, and besides the Sacraments have the testimony of a
good life, there is no one who would not grant that without doubt such persons may be
raised to the clerical office, especially in such necessity as the present. But there are others
of this sect, who being already clergymen, desire to pass to us with their peoples and also
with their honours, such as for the sake of office are converts to life, and that they may retain
them seek for salvation [i.e., enter the Church]. I think that the question concerning such
may be left to the graver consideration of our aforesaid brothers, and that when they have
considered by their more prudent counsel the matter referred to them, they may vouchsafe
to advise us what approves itself to them with regard to this question. Only concerning
those who as children were baptized by heretics we decree that they consent, if it seems
good, to our decision concerning the ordination of the same. All things, therefore, which
we have set forth above with the holy bishops, let your honourable fraternity with me adjudge
to be done.</p>

everywhere more and more for the good estate and health of the Church. And they subscribed,

to the wiles and wickednesses of the Donatist heretics and schismatics, by which they gravely

holding different opinions, “that perchance,” as the Apostle says, when we have corrected461

<head>Canon LXVIII. (Greek lxxi.)</head>
<p>That the Donatist clergy are to be received into the Catholic Church as clergymen.
It moreover seemed good that letters be sent to our brethren and fellow-bishops, and
especially to the Apostolic See, over which our aforesaid venerable brother and colleague
Anastasius, presides, that <del>ἐπειδὴ in the Greek, quo in the Latin</del> he may know that Africa
is in great need, for the peace and prosperity of the Church, that those Donatists who were
clergymen and who by good advice had desired to return to Catholic unity, should be treated
according to the will and judgment of each Catholic bishop who governs the Church in that
place; and, if it seem good for Christian peace, they be received with their honours, as it is
clear was done in the former times of this same division. And that this was the case the example
of the majority, yea, of nearly all the African Churches in which this error had sprung
up, testify; not that the Council which met about this matter in foreign parts should be done
away, but that it may remain in force with regard to those who so will to come over to the
Catholic Church that there be procured by them no breaking of unity. But those through
whom Catholic unity was seen to have been altogether perfected or assisted by the manifest
winning of the souls of their brethren in the places where they live, there shall not be objected
to them the decree contrary to their honour adopted by a foreign council, for salvation is
shut off to no one, that is to say, that those ordained by the Donatist party, if having been
corrected they have been willing to return to the Catholic Church, are not to be463 received
in their grades, according to the foreign council; but they are to be excepted through whom
they received the advice to return to Catholic unity.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVIII.</p>
<p>Those ordained by the Donatists, even though their reception has been forbidden by a
foreign synod, since it is truly good that all should be saved, if they correct themselves, let them
be received.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>This canon is special, for it seemed good to the fathers that such of the Donatists as
came to the orthodox faith should be so received as to hold the grade of their holy orders,
even though a transmarine, that is to say an Italian, council had decreed otherwise.</p>
<note type="footnote">463 The Greek and Beveridge introduce a second “not.”</note>

<pb n="941"/>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>Those Donatists who are penitent and anathematize their heresy are to be allowed to
remain in their proper rank, and be numbered among the clergy of the Catholic Church,
because Africa was labouring under a great shortness of clergy.</p>
<p>This canon is Canon ij. of Carthage, Sept., a.d. 401.</p>
<p>Johnson.</p>
<p>Whether the Donatists’ clergy should be re-ordained was only a point of discipline; for
the Donatists retained Episcopacy. Therefore the African fathers, as they leave other churches
to their liberty, so at the same time they declare that they would continue their old practice,
and leave every bishop to act according to his own discretion in this matter. Probably, one
great motive, besides that of peace, which they had to this, was the great scarcity of clergymen
in Africa, of which Aurelius complains in his speech, inserted into the Acts before Canon
77 (61), and proposes that they send to the bishops of Rome and Milan for a supply. And
that this was the true reason, does in some measure appear from the words of the Latin
canon at large, in which the occasion of this decree is said to be propter necessitatem. And
this is the most probable reason why it is left to the discretion of the bishop, whether to admit
Donatist clergymen as such, if he had occasion for their service. And after all it is clear from
this very canon, that other churches had determined this point the contrary way. Therefore
Mr. Calamy exceeds when he says: “As for the Donatists, all agree that their orders were
acknowledged.” Further, he would have it thought probable that orders were not always
conferred among the Donatists by persons superior to presbyters. This he would infer from
the great number of the bishops of that faction in Africa, viz., 278, many of which (says he)
could be no more than parish ministers. But why so? Were there not above four hundred
Catholic bishops? And why not as many of one side as the other? If our dissenters of any
sort had fallen into the Episcopal form of government, no question but they would have
had a bishop in every city at least, and equalled our church in the number of prelates.</p>

<head>Canon LXIX. (Greek lxxii.)</head>
<p>That a legation be sent to the Donatists for the sake of making peace.</p>
<p>It further seemed good, that when these things were done, legates should be sent from
our number to those of the Donatists whom they hold as bishops, or to the people, for the
sake of preaching peace and unity, without which Christian salvation cannot be attained;
and that these legates should direct the attention of all to the fact that they have no just objection
to urge against the Catholic Church. And especially that this be made manifest to
all by the municipal acts (on account of the weight of their documents) what they themselves
had done in the case of the Maximianists, their own schismatics. For in this case it is shown
them by divine grace, if they will but heed it, that their separation from the unity of the
Church is as iniquitous as they now proclaim the schism of the Maximianists from themselves
to be. Nevertheless from the number, those whom they condemned by the authority of
their plenary council, they received back with their honours, and accepted the baptism which
they had given while condemned and cut off. And thus let them see how with stupid heart
they resist the peace of the Church scattered throughout the whole world, when they do
these things on the part of Donatus, neither do they say that they are contaminated by
communion with those whom they so receive for the making of peace, and yet they despise
us, that is the Catholic Church, which is established even in the extreme parts of the earth,
as being defiled by the communion of those whom the accusers have not been able to win
over to themselves.464</p>

<p>“Tractory” has several significations; here it seems to denote the written return made
by the Primate of the province to the synodical letter sent by the Bishop of Carthage. In the
acts inserted between canon 90th and 91st “Tractoria” seems to denote the letter of the
Primate to the inferior bishops for choosing legates, if it do not rather denote the Bishop of
Carthage’s circular-letter to all the primates, as it does in the next paragraph.</p>
<p><del>The penalty in the last clause is</del> a very singular sort of censure, and very moderate.

<p>Of Cresconius.</p>
<p>Concerning Cresconius of Villa Regis this seemed good to all, that the Primate of Numidia
should be informed on this matter so that he should by his letters summon the
aforementioned Cresconius in order that at the next plenary Council of Africa he should
not put off making an appearance. But if he contemns the summons and does not come,
let him recognize the fact that sentence should be pronounced against him.</p>

<p>Unless Cresconius who has been summoned by letter to the Synod, shall appear, let him

<p>Of the Church of Hippo-Diarrhytus.</p>
<p>It further seemed good that since the destitution of the Church of Hippo-Diarrhytus
should no longer be neglected, and the churches there are retained by those who have declined
the infamous communion of Equitius, that certain bishops be sent from the present
council, viz.: Reginus, Alypius, Augustine, Maternus, Theasius, Evodius, Placian, Urban,
Valerius, Ambivius, Fortunatus, Quodvultdeus, Honoratus, Januarius, Aptus, Honoratus,
Ampelius, Victorian, Evangelus and Rogation; and when those had been gathered together,
and those had been corrected who with culpable pertinacity were of opinion that this flight
of the same Equitius should be waited for, let a bishop be ordained for them by the vote of
all. But if these should not be willing to consider peace, let them not prevent the choosing
for ordination of a bishop, for the advantage of the church which has been so long destitute.</p>

proved to have been laid up, should be overturned by the bishops who rule over such places,
if such a thing can be done. But should this be impossible on account of the popular tumult
it would arouse, the people should none the less be admonished not to frequent such places,
and that those who believe rightly should be held bound by no superstition of the place.
And no memory of martyrs should at all be accepted, unless where there is found the body
or some reliques, on which is declared traditionally and by good authority to have been
originally his habitation, or possession, or the scene of his passion. For altars which have

legates, who are to be sent throughout the African provinces, in the matter of the Donatists;
and it seemed good that the letters given them should contain the tenor of the mandate

<p>In this Council previous decrees are confirmed.</p>
<p>In the fifth consulate of the most glorious Emperors Arcadius and Honorius, Augusti,
the VI Calends of September, in the City of Milevis, in the secretarium of the basilica, when
Aurelius the bishop of Carthage had taken his seat in plenary council, the deacons standing
by, Aurelius, the bishop, said: Since the body of the holy Church is one, and there is one
head of all the members, it has come to pass by the divine permission and assistance given
to our weakness, that we, invited out of brotherly love, have come to this church. Wherefore
I beg your charity to believe that our coming to you is neither superfluous, nor unacceptable
to all; and that the consent of all of us may make it manifest that we agree with the decrees
already confirmed by the Council at Hippo or which were defined afterwards by a larger
synod at Carthage, these shall now be read to us in order. Then at last the agreement of
your holiness will appear clearer than light, if they know that the things lawfully defined by
us in former councils, ye have set forth, not only by your consent to these acts, but also by
your subscriptions.</p>
<p>Xantippus, bishop of the first see of Numidia said: I believe what pleased all the brethren
and the statutes they confirmed with their hands; we by our subscribing our names shew
that it pleases us also, and have confirmed them with our superscription.</p>

<pb n="959"/>
<p>Nicetius, the bishop of the first see of Mauritania Sitifensis said: The decrees which

<head>Canon LXXXVI. (Greek lxxxix.)</head>
<p>Of the order of bishops, that those ordained more recently do not dare to take precedence
of those ordained before them.</p>
<p>Valentine, the bishop, said: If your good patience will permit, I follow the things which
were done in time past in the Church of Carthage, and which were illustrious having been
confirmed by the subscriptions of the brethren, and I profess that we intend to preserve
this. For this we know, that ecclesiastical discipline has always remained inviolate: therefore
let none of the brethren dare to place himself before those ordained earlier than himself;
but by the offices of charity this has always been shewn to those ordained earlier, which always
should be accepted joyfully by those ordained more recently. Let your holiness give command
that this order be strengthened by your interlocutions. Aurelius, the bishop, said: It would
not be fitting that we should repeat these things, were it not for the existence of certain inconsiderate
minds, which would induce us to making such statutes; but this is a common
cause about which our brother and fellow bishop has spoken, that each one of us should
recognize the order decreed to him by God, and that the more recent should defer to the
earlier ordained, and they should presume to do nothing when these have not been consulted.
Wherefore I say, now that I think of it, that they who think they may presume to take precedence
over those ordained before them, should be coerced suitably by the great council.
Xantippus, bishop of the first see of Numidia, said: All the brethren present have heard
what our brother and fellow bishop Aurelius has said, what answer do we make? Datian,
the bishop, said: The decrees made by our ancestors should be strengthened by our assent,
so that the action taken by the Church of Carthage in past synods should hold fast, being
confirmed by the full assent of all of us. And all the bishops said: This order has been preserved
by our fathers and by our ancestors, and shall be preserved by us through the help
of God, the rights of the primacy of Numidia and of Mauritania being kept intact.</p>
<p>Of the archives and matricula of Numidia.</p>
<p>Moreover it seemed good to all the bishops who subscribed in this council that the
matricula and the archives of Numidia should be at the first see and in the Metropolis, that
is Constantina.</p>

<p>The introduction belongs to the Synod of Milevis, of August 27, a.d. 402.</p>
<p>This canon (lxxxvj.) is Canon j., of the above named Synod.</p>
<p>Johnson.</p>
<p>From this canon it appears that the primacy in Africa was ambulatory, and belonged
to the senior bishop of the province. If the primacy had been fixed to the bishop of any
certain city, as in other countries, there would have been a salvo or exception for that bishop,
as there is in the 24th canon of the Synod of Bracara [Braga] in Spain, which orders that all
bishops take place according to their seniority, with a reserve to the bishop of the metropolis.
The bishop of Carthage was not included in this canon; for it is evident that he had a precedence
annexed to his see, and that he was in reality a sort of patriarch. The reason why
Numidia and Mauritania are particularly mentioned is, that some disputes had been started
there on that subject.</p>

<p>Concerning Quodvultdeus, the bishop.</p>
<p>In the case of Quodvultdeus of Centuria, it pleased all the bishops that no one should
communicate with him until his cause should be brought to a conclusion, for his accuser
when he sought to bring the cause before our council, upon being asked whether he was
willing with him to be tried before the bishops, at first said that he was, but on another day
answered that he was not willing, and went away. Under these circumstances to deprive
him of his bishoprick, before the conclusion of his cause was known, could commend itself
to no Christian as a just act.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXVII.</p>
<p>Since Quodvultdeus at first promised to come to our synod when his opposer had asked
that he be admitted, and afterwards withdrew, saying that that was displeasing to him, he
should be excommunicated, until the cause is finished. But it is not just that he be deposed
before sentence is given.</p>

<p>There is set forth in this council what the bishops did who were sent as legates across seas.</p>
<p>In the consulship of those most illustrious men, the most glorious Emperor Theodosius
Augustus, and Rumoridus, the VIII.468 Calends of September, at Carthage, in the basilica
of the second region, when Aurelius the bishop had taken his seat in plenary council, the
deacons standing by, Aurelius, the bishop, said: From stress of circumstances, venerable
brethren, I, although so small, have been led to assemble you in council. For a while ago,
as your holinesses will remember, while holding a council we sent our brothers as legates
to the regions beyond seas. It is right that these should at this meeting of your holinesses
narrate the course of their now finished legation, and although yesterday when we were in
session concerning this matter, besides ecclesiastical matters, we paid some prolonged attention
to what they had done, nevertheless it is right that to-day the discussion of yesterday
should be confirmed by ecclesiastical action.</p>
<p>Of the bishops of the African provinces who were not present at this council.469</p>
<p>The right order of things demands that first of all we should enquire concerning our
brethren and fellow bishops, who were to come to this council either from Byzacena or at
least from Mauritania, like as they decreed that they would be present in this council. And
when Philologius, Geta, Venustianus, and Felician, bishops of the province of Byzacena had
presented and read their letters of legation, and Lucian and Silvanus, legates of the province
of Mauritania Sitiphensis, had done the same, the bishop Aurelius said: Let the text of these
writings be placed in the acts.</p>

<p>Of the Byzacene bishops.</p>
<p>Numidius, the bishop, said: We observe that our brethren and fellow bishops of the
province of Byzacena and of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis have sent legates to the
council; we now seek whether the legates of Numidia have come, or at least of the province
of Tripoli or of Mauritania-Cæsariensis.</p>
<p>Of the bishops of Mauritania Sitiphensis.</p>
<p>Lucian and Silvanus, the bishops, legates of the Province of Mauritania Sitiphensis said:
The tractory came late to our Cæsarian brethren or they would have been here; and they
will certainly come, and we are confident of their attitude of mind that whatever shall be
determined by this council, they without doubt will assent unto.</p>
<p>Of the bishops of Numidia.</p>
<p>Alypius, bishop of the church of Tagaste said: We have come from Numidia, I and the
holy brethren Augustine and Possidius, but a legation could not be sent from Numidia, because
by the tumult of the recruits the bishops have either been prevented from coming or
fully occupied by their own necessary affairs in their sees. For after I had brought to the
holy Senex Xantippus your holiness’s tractory, this seemed good in the present business
that a council should be appointed, to which a delegation with instructions should be sent,
but when I reported to him in later letters the impediment of the recruits, of which I have
just spoken, he excused them by his own rescripts. Aurelius, the bishop, said: There is no
doubt that the aforesaid brethren and bishops of Numidia, when they shall have received
the acts of the council, will give their consent and will take pains to carry into effect whatever
shall have been adopted. It is therefore necessary that by the solicitude of this see what we
shall have determined be communicated to them.</p>
<p>Of the bishops of Tripoli.</p>
<p>This is what I could learn concerning our brethren of Tripoli, that they appointed our
brother Dulcicius as a legate: but because he could not come, certain of our sons coming
from the aforesaid province asserted that the aforesaid had taken shipping, and that it was
thought that his arrival had been delayed by storms; nevertheless also concerning these
matters, if your charity is willing, this form shall be preserved, that the placets of the council
be sent to them. And all the bishops said: What your holiness has decreed pleases us all.</p>

each one of us should call together in his city the chiefs of the Donatists either alone and
with one of his neighbour bishops, so that in like manner in the different cities and places

And let this be made an edict if it seems good to all. And all the bishops said: It seems good

have impetrated, we ask your gravity to have read, and that you order it to be joined to the
acts and carried into effect. When the jussio had been read and joined to the acts, the
bishop of the Catholic Church,470 said: Vouchsafe to listen to the mandate to be sent through
your gravity to the Donatists, and to insert it in the acts, and to carry it to them, and informs
us in your acts of their answer. “We, sent by the authority of our Catholic Council, have
called you together, desiring to rejoice in your correction, bearing in mind the charity of
the Lord who said: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God;
and moreover he admonished through the prophet those who say they are not our brothers,
that we ought to say: Ye are our brethren. Therefore you ought not to despise this pacific
commonitory coming of love, so that if ye think we have any part of the truth, ye do not
hesitate to say so: that is, when your council is gathered together, ye delegate of your number
certain to whom you intrust the statement of your case; so that we may be able to do this
also, that there shall be delegated from our Council who with them delegated by you may
discuss peacefully, at a determined place and time, whatever question there is which separates
your communion from us; and that at length the old error may receive an end through the
assistance of our Lord God, lest through the animosity of men, weak souls, and ignorant
people should perish by sacrilegious dissension. But if ye shall accept this proposition in a
fraternal spirit, the truth will easily shine forth, but if ye are not willing to do this, your distrust
will be easily known.” And when this had been read, all the bishops said: This pleases
us well, so let it be. And they subscribed: I, Aurelius, bishop of the Carthaginian Church,
have consented to this decree, and having read it, have subscribed it. Likewise also the rest
of the bishops signed.</p>

<p>What things should be said to the Donatists are these: “We greatly desire to rejoice in
your conversion; for we have been commanded to say even to those not desiring to be our
brethren, ‘Ye are our brothers.’ We come therefore to you and we exhort you that if you have
any defence to make, ye should appoint certain persons to whom this should be entrusted,
who, at a fixed time and place, shall urge your case; otherwise your distrust wilt be thenceforward
patent.”</p>

<head>Canon XCIII. (Greek xcvi.)</head>
<p>The character of the Commonitory which the legates received against the Donatists.</p>
<p>The Commonitorium for our brothers Theasius and Evodius, sent as legates from the
Council of Carthage to the most glorious and most religious princes. When by the help of
the Lord they are come into the presence of the most pious princes, they shall declare to
them with what fulness of confidence, according to the direction of the council of the year
before, the prelates of the Donatists had been urged by the municipal authority to assemble,
in order that if they really meant their professions, they might by fit persons chosen from
their number, enter into a peaceful conference with us in Christian meekness, and whatever
they held as truth they might not hesitate to declare it frankly; so that from such conference
the sincerity of the Catholic position, which has been conspicuous for so long a time, might
be perceived even by those who from ignorance or obstinacy were opposing themselves to
it. But deterred by their want of confidence they scarcely ventured to reply. And forsooth,
because we had discharged toward them the offices which become bishops and peacemakers,
and they had no answer to make to the truth, they betook themselves to unreasonable acts
of brute force, and treacherously oppressed many of the bishops and clergy, to say nothing
of the laity. And some of the churches they actually invaded, and tried to assault still others.</p>
<p>And now, it behoves the gracious clemency of their Majesties to take measures that the
Catholic Church, which has begotten them as worshippers of Christ in her womb, and has
nourished them with the strong meat of the faith, should by their forethought, be defended,
lest violent men, taking advantage of the times of religious excitement, should by fear
overcome a weak people, whom by argument they were not able to pervert. It is well known
how often the vile gatherings (detestabilis manus) of the Circumcelliones471 have been forbidden
by the laws, and also condemned by many decrees of the Emperors, their majesties
most religious predecessors. Against the madness of these people it is not unusual nor
contrary to the holy Scriptures to ask for secular [θείας in the Greek] protection, since Paul
the Apostle, as is related in the authentic Acts of the Apostles, warded off a conspiracy of
certain lawless men by the help of the military. Now then we ask that there be extended to
the Catholic Churches, without any dissimulation, the protection of the ordinum <del>i.e.
companies of soldiers, stationed</del> in each city, and of the holders of the suburban estates in
the various places.472 At the same time it will be necessary to ask that they give commandment
that the law, set forth by their father Theodosius, of pious memory, which imposed a
fine of ten pounds of gold upon both the ordainers and the ordained among heretics, and
which was also directed against proprietors at whose houses conventicles were held, be
<note type="footnote">471 Vide Kraus. Real. Encyclopædie.</note>
<note type="footnote">472 The text is corrupt and the Greek and Latin do not agree in many places.</note>

<pb n="971"/>
confirmed anew; so that it may be effective with persons of this sort when Catholics, provoked
by their wiles, shall lay complaint against them; so that through fear at least, they may cease
from making schisms and from the wickedness of the heretics, since they refuse to be cleansed
and corrected by the thought of the eternal punishment.</p>
<p>Let request be also made that the law depriving heretics of the power of being able to
receive or bequeath by gift or by will, be straightway renewed by their Piety, so that all right
of giving or receiving may be taken away from those who, blinded by the madness of obstinacy,
are determined to continue in the error of the Donatists.</p>
<p>With regard to those who by considerations of unity and peace are willing to correct
themselves, let permission be granted to them to receive their inheritance, the law notwithstanding,
even though the bequest by gift or inheritance was made while they were yet living
in the error of the heretics; those of course being excepted, who under the stress of legal
proceedings have sought to enter the Catholic Church; for it may well be supposed, that
persons of this latter sort desired Catholic unity, not so much from fear of the judgment of
heaven, as from the greed of earthly gain.</p>
<p>For the furtherance of all these things the help of the Powers (Potestatum) of each one
of the provinces is needed. With regard to other matters, whatever they shall perceive is
for the Church’s interests, this we have resolved that the legation have full authority to do
and to carry into effect. Moreover it seemed good to us all, that letters from our assembly
should be sent to the most glorious Emperors and most Excellent Worthinesses, whereby
they may be assured of the agreement of us all that the legates should be sent by us to their
most blessed court.</p>
<p>Since it is a very slow business for us all to set our names to these letters, and in order
that they may not be burdened with the signature of each one of us, we desire thee, brother
Aurelius, that thy charity be good enough to sign them in the name of us all. And to this
they all agreed.</p>
<p>I, Aurelius, Bishop of the Church of Carthage have consented to this decree and have
subscribed my name. And so all the other bishops subscribed.</p>
<p>Letters ought likewise to be sent to the judges that, until the lord permit the legates to
return to us, they give protection through the soldiers of the cities, and through the holders
of the farms of the Catholic Church. It ought also to be added concerning the dishonest
Equitius, which he had shewn by laying claim to the jus sacerdotum, that he be rejected
from the diocese of Hippo according to the statutes of the Emperors. Letters ought also to
be sent to the Bishop of the Church of Rome in commendation of the legates, and to the
other Bishops who may be where the Emperor is. To this they assented.</p>
<p>Likewise I, Aurelius, Bishop of the Church of Carthage, have consented to this decree,
and having read it, have set my name to it.</p>
<p>And all the other bishops likewise subscribed.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIII.</p>
<p>The Emperors who were born in the true religion and were educated in the faith, ought
to stretch forth a helping hand to the Churches. For the military band overthrew the dire
conspiracy which was threatening Paul.</p>
<p>Here follows a brief declaration of what things were decreed in this Synod.</p>
<p>When Stilico a second time and Anthemius, those illustrious men, were consuls, on the
tenth before the calends of September, at Carthage in the basilica of the second region. I
have not written out in full the acts of this council473 because they treat of the necessities
of the time rather than of matters of general interest, but for the instruction of the studious
I have added a brief digest of the same council.474</p>

<head>Canon XCIV. (Greek xcvii.)</head>
<p>Summary of Chapters.</p>
<p>That a free delegation be sent to the council from all the provinces to Mizoneum. Legates475
and letters were ordered to be sent for the purpose of directing the free legation:
that became the unity had been made only at Carthage, letters should also be given to the
judges, that they might order in the other provinces and cities the work of union to be proceeded
with, and the thanksgivings of the Church of Carthage for the whole of Africa concerning
the exclusion of the Donatists should be sent with the letters of the bishops to Court
(ad Comitatum).</p>
<p>The letters of Pope Innocent were read: that bishops ought not readily to carry causes
across seas, and this very thing was confirmed by the judgment of the bishops themselves;
that on account of thanksgiving and the exclusion of the Donatists, two clerics of the Church
of Carthage should be sent to Court.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIV.</p>
<p>It seemed good that letters be sent to the Magistrates that the Donatists be expelled.476</p>
<p>This introduction is taken from the Synod of Carthage of August 23, 405. There is also
added the introduction of the Synod of Carthage of June 13, 407.</p>
<p>In this synod certain things already decreed are corrected.</p>
<p>Under the most illustrious emperors Honorius for the VIIth time, and Theodosius for
the second time, the consuls being the Augusti, on the Ides of July in Carthage in the basilica
of the second region, when bishop Aurelius together with his other bishops had taken his
seat, and while the deacons stood by, he said: Since it was decreed in the council of Hippo,
that each year there should assemble a plenary council of Africa, not only here in Carthage
but also in the different provinces in their order, and this was reserved that we should determine
its place of meeting sometimes in Numidia and sometimes in Byzacium. But this
seemed laborious to all the brethren.</p>

<p>An universal council to be held only when necessary.</p>
<p>It seemed good that there should be no more the yearly necessity of fatiguing the
brethren; but as often as common cause, that is of the whole of Africa, demands, that letters
shall be given on every side to that see in this matter, that a synod should be gathered in
that province, where the desirability of it induces; but let the causes which are not of general
interest be judged in their own provinces.</p>

<head>Canon XCVII. (Greek c.)</head>
<p>That there be sought from the Emperor the protection of Advocates in causes ecclesiastical.</p>
<p>It seemed good that the legates who were about leaving, viz., Vincent and Fortunatian,
should in the name of all the provinces ask from the most glorious Emperors to give a faculty
for the establishment of scholastic defensors, whose shall be the care of this very kind of
business: so that as the priests477 of the province, they who have received the faculty as
defensors of the Churches in ecclesiastical affairs, as often as necessity arises, may be able
to enter the private apartments of the judges, so as to resist what is urged on the other side,
or to make necessary explanations.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>

<p>That there be asked of the Emperor the appointment of Patrons for ecclesiastical heads,
whose care it should be to defend the Church in its affairs, and who as priests could easily refer
what things were urgent.</p>

<p>That the legation be free.</p>
<p>It seemed good that the chosen legates should have at the meeting freedom of action
(legationem liberam).</p>
<p>The protest of the Mauritanian bishops against Primosus.</p>
<p>It is evident that those of Mauritania Cæsariensis gave evidence in their own writings
that Primosus had been summoned by the chiefs of the Thiganensian city, that he should
present himself to the plenary council according to the imperial constitutions, and, when
sought for, as was right, Primosus was not found, at least so the deacons reported. But since
the same Mauritanians petitioned that letters be sent from the whole synod to the venerable
brother, the aged Innocent, it seemed good that they should be sent, that he might know
that Primosus had been sought at the council and not found at all.</p>

<p>Of people or dioceses returned from the Donatists.</p>
<p>Such communities as have returned from the Donatists and have had bishops, without
doubt may continue to have them even without any action of the councils, but such a community
as had a bishop and when he dies wish no longer to have a bishop of their own, but
to belong to the diocese of some other bishop, this is not to be denied them. Also such
bishops as before the promulgation of the imperial law concerning unity as brought back
their people to the Catholic Church, they ought to be allowed still to rule them: but from
the time of that law of unity, all the Churches, and their dioceses, and if perchance there be
any instruments of the Church or things pertaining to its rights should belong to the Catholic
bishops of those places to whom the places pertained while under the heretics, whether
they be converted to the Catholic Church or remain unconverted heretics. Whoever after
this law shall make any such usurpation, shall restore as is meet the usurped possessions.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>

<p>Whoever are converted from the Donatists may retain their own bishops, although they
had them without the consent of the synod; and when the bishop is dead, if they do not wish

they shall be allowed to do so. And such bishops as before the union have brought back the
people they ruled, let them still rule them. After the imperial Edict on Unity every church

<p>That infants are baptized for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>Likewise it seemed good that whosoever denies that infants newly from their mother’s
wombs should be baptized, or says that baptism is for remission of sins, but that they derive
from Adam no original sin, which needs to be removed by the laver of regeneration, from
whence the conclusion follows, that in them the form of baptism for the remission of sins,
is to be understood as false and not true, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>For no otherwise can be understood what the Apostle says, “By one man sin is come
into the world, and death through sin, and so death passed upon all men in that all have
sinned,” than the Catholic Church everywhere diffused has always understood it. For on
account of this rule of faith (regulam fidei) even infants, who could have committed as yet
no sin themselves, therefore are truly baptized for the remission of sins, in order that what
in them is the result of generation may be cleansed by regeneration.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon CX.</p>
<p>Whoso affirms that those newly born and baptized contract nothing from Adam’s transgression,
which needs to be washed away by baptism, is to be execrated: for through one both
death and sin invaded the whole world.</p>

<p>See Can. 63, 104, both which are double, as this likewise is in the old Greek scholiasts.</p>
<p><del>Also it seemed good, that if anyone should say that the saying of the Lord, “In my
Father’s house are many mansions” is to be understood as meaning that in the kingdom of
heaven there will be a certain middle place, or some place somewhere, in which infants live
in happiness who have gone forth from this life without baptism, without which they cannot
enter the kingdom of heaven, which is eternal life, let him be anathema. For after our Lord
has said: “Except a man be born again of water and of the Holy Spirit he shall not enter the
kingdom of heaven,” what Catholic can doubt that he who has not merited to be coheir with
Christ shall become a sharer with the devil: for he who fails of the right hand without doubt
shall receive the left hand portion.</del></p>

<p>Also, whoever shall say that the same grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord helps

so that we may know what to seek, what we ought to avoid, and also that we should
love to do so, but that through it we are not helped so that we are able to do what we know
we should do, let him be anathema. For when the Apostle says: “Wisdom puffeth up, but
charity edifieth” it were truly infamous were we to believe that we have the grace of Christ
for that which puffeth us up, but have it not for that which edifieth, since in each case it is
the gift of God, both to know what we ought to do, and to love to do it; so that wisdom
cannot puff us up while charity is edifying us. For as of God it is written, “Who teacheth

<p>It seemed good that whosoever should say that the grace of justification was given to

through our free will; as if though grace was not given, although not easily, yet nevertheless
we could even without grace fulfil the divine commandments, let him be anathema. For

<p>It also seemed good that as St. John the Apostle says, “If we shall say that we have no
sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,” whosoever thinks that this should be so
understood as to mean that out of humility, we ought to say that we have sin, and not because
it is really so, let him be anathema. For the Apostle goes on to add, “But if we confess our
sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity,” where
it is sufficiently clear that this is said not only of humility but also truly. For the Apostle
might have said, “If we shall say we have no sins we shall extoll ourselves, and humility shall
have no place in us;” but when he says, “we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us” he
sufficiently intimates that he who affirmed that he had no sin would speak not that which
is true but that which is false.</p>

<p>That in the Lord’s Prayer the Saints say for themselves: “Forgive us our trespasses.”</p>
<p>It has seemed good that whoever should say that when in the Lord’s prayer, the saints
say, “forgive us our trespasses,” they say this not for themselves, because they have no need
of this petition, but for the rest who are sinners of the people; and that therefore no one of
the saints can say, “Forgive me my trespasses,” but “Forgive us our trespasses;” so that the
just is understood to seek this for others rather than for himself; let him be anathema. For
holy and just was the Apostle James, when he said, “For in many things we offend all.” For
why was it added “all,” unless that this sentence might agree also with the psalm, where we
read, “Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall no man living
be justified;” and in the prayer of the most wise Solomon: “There is no man that sinneth
not;” and in the book of the holy Job: “He sealeth in the hand of every man, that every man
may know his own infirmity;” wherefore even the holy and just Daniel when in prayer said
several times: “We have sinned, we have done iniquity,” and other things which there truly
and humbly he confessed; nor let it be thought (as some have thought) that this was said
not of his own but rather of the people’s sins, for he said further on: “When I shall pray and
confess my sins and the sins of my people to the Lord my God;” he did not wish to say our
sins, but he said the sins of his people and his own sins, since he as a prophet foresaw that
those who were to come would thus misunderstand his words.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXV.</p>
<p>Whoso expounds this, “forgive us our trespasses” as speaking only of the multitude and

<p>Of peoples converted from the Donatists.</p>
<p>Item, it seemed good, since it was so decreed some years ago by a plenary council, that
whatever churches were erected in a diocese before the laws were made concerning Donatists
when they became Catholic, should pertain to the sees of those bishops through whom their
return to Catholic unity was brought about; but after the laws whatever churches communicated
were to belong there where they belonged when they were Donatists. But because
many controversies afterward arose and are still springing up between bishops concerning
dioceses, which were not then at all in prospect, now it has seemed good to this council,
that wherever there was a Catholic and a Donatist party, pertaining to different sees, at
whatever time unity has been or shall be made, whether before or after the laws, the churches
shall belong to that see to which the Catholic church which was already there belonged.</p>

Catholic unity, that equally there should be divided what shall have been so found where
there were two parties; that is, that some places should pertain to one and some to the other;
and let the division be made by him who has been the longest time in the episcopate, and
let the younger choose. But should there be only one place let it belong to him who is found
to be the nearer. But should the distance be equal to each of the two cathedrals let it belong
to the one the people may choose. But should the old Catholics wish their own bishop, and
if the same be the case with the converted Donatists, let the will of the greater number prevail,
but should the parties be equal, let it belong to him who has been longest bishop. But if so
many places be found in which there were both parties, that an equal division is impossible,
as for example, if they are unequal in number, after those places have been distributed which
have an equal number, the place that remains over shall be disposed of as is provided above

was silent, he shall lose the opportunity. But if there was no bishop, no prejudice shall

for them to wait for the completion of the rest of the business to be treated of, and that they
must hasten to their own churches; it seemed good to the whole council, that by all some

done. And it came about that those were present whose subscriptions testify that they were

<p>That those out of communion should not be allowed to bring accusation.</p>
<p>It seemed good to all, as it had been decreed by the former councils, concerning what
persons were to be admitted to bring accusations against clerics; and since it had not been
expressed what persons should not be admitted, therefore we define, that he cannot properly
be admitted to bring an accusation, who had been already excommunicated, and was still
lying under that censure, whether he that wished to be the accuser were cleric or layman.</p>

But when it met again on the 30th of the same month, it continued the code. The introduction

<p>That slaves and freedmen and all infamous persons ought not to bring accusation.</p>
<p>To all it seemed good that no slaves or freedmen, properly so called, be admitted to accusation
nor any of those who by the public laws are debarred from bringing accusation in
criminal proceedings. This also is the case with all those who have the stain of infamy, that
is actors, and persons subject to turpitudes, also heretics, or heathen, or Jews; but even all
those to whom the right of bringing accusation is denied, are not forbidden to bring accusation
in their own suits.</p>

<head>Canon CXXXIV. (Continuation of cxxxv. in the Greek.)</head>
<p>Here beginneth the letter directed from the whole African Council to Boniface, bishop of
the City of Rome, by Faustinus the bishop, and Philip and Asellus the presbyters, legates of
the Roman Church.</p>
<p>To the most blessed lord, and our honourable brother Boniface, Aurelius, Valentine of
the primatial See of Numidia, and others present with us to the number of 217 from the
whole council in Africa.</p>
<p>Since it has pleased the Lord that our humility should write concerning those things
which with us our holy brethren, Faustinus a fellow-bishop and Philip and Asellus, fellow
presbyters, have done, not to the bishop Zosimus of blessed memory, from whom they
brought commands and letters to us, but to your holiness, who art constituted in his room
by divine authority, we ought briefly to set forth what has been determined upon by mutual
consent; not indeed those things which are contained in the prolix volumes of the acts, in
which, while charity was preserved, yet we loitered not without some little labour of altercation,
deliberating those things in the acts which now pertain to the cause. However the
more gratefully would he have received this news as he would have seen a more peaceful
ending of the matter, my lord and brother, had he been still in the body! Apiarius the
presbyter, concerning whose ordination, excommunication, and appeal no small scandal
arose not only at Sicca but also in the whole African Church, has been restored to communion
upon his seeking pardon for all his sins. First our fellow bishop Urban of Sicca doubtless
corrected whatever in him seemed to need correction. For there should have been kept in
mind the peace and quiet of the Church not only in the present but also in the future, since
so many evils of such a kind had gone before, that it was incumbent to take care that like
or even graver evils should be prevented thereafter. It seemed good to us that the presbyter
Apiarius should be removed from the church of Sicca, retaining only the honour of his
grade, and that he should exercise the office of the presbyterate wherever else he wished and
could, having received a letter to this effect. This we granted without difficulty at his own
petition made in a letter. But truly before this case should be thus closed, among other
things which we were treating of in daily discussions, the nature of the case demanded that
we should ask our brothers, Faustinus our fellow bishop, and Philip and Asellus our fellow
presbyters, to set forth what they had been enjoined to treat of with us that they might be
inserted in the ecclesiastical acts. And they proceeded to make a verbal statement, but when
we earnestly asked that they would present it rather in writing, then they produced the

<pb n="1018"/>
Commonitory. This was read to us and also set down in the acts, which they are bringing
with them to you. In this they were bidden to treat of four things with us, first concerning
the appeal of bishops to the Pontiff of the Roman Church, second that bishops should not
unbecomingly be sailing to court, thirdly concerning the treating the causes of presbyters
and deacons by contiguous bishops, if they had been wrongly excommunicated by their
own, and fourthly concerning the bishop Urban who should be excommunicated or even
sent to Rome, unless he should have corrected what seemed to need correction. Of all which
things concerning the first and third, that is that it is allowed to bishops to appeal to Rome
and that the causes of clerics should be settled by the bishops of their own provinces, already
last year we have taken pains to insinuate, in our letter to the same bishop Zosimus of venerable
memory, that we were willing to observe these provisions for a little while without
any injury to him, until the search for the statutes of the Council of Nice had been finished.
And now we ask of your holiness that you would cause to be observed by us the acts and
constitutions of our fathers at the Council of Nice, and that you cause to be exercised by
you there, those things which they brought in the commonitory: that is to say, If a bishop
shall have been accused, etc. <del>Here follows Canon vii. of Sardica.</del></p>
<p>Item concerning presbyters and deacons. If any bishop has been quickly angered, etc.
<del>Here follows Canon xvii. of Sardica.</del></p>
<p>These are the things which have been inserted in the acts until the arrival of the most
accurate copies of the Nicene Council, which things,485 if they are contained there (as in
the Commonitory, which our brethren directed to us from the Apostolic See alleged) and
be even kept according to that order by you in Italy, in no way could we be compelled either
to endure such treatment as we are unwilling to mention or could suffer what is unbearable:
486 but we believe, through the mercy of our Lord God, while your holiness presides
over the Roman Church, we shall not have to suffer that pride (istum typhum passuri). And
there will be kept toward us, what should be kept with brotherly love to us who are making
no dispute. You will also perceive according to the wisdom and the justice which the most
Highest has given thee, what should be observed,487 if perchance the canons of the Council
of Nice are other <del>than you suppose</del>. For although we have read very many copies, yet
never have we read in the Latin copies that there were any such decrees as are contained in
the commonitory before mentioned. So too, because we can find them in no Greek text
<note type="footnote">485 The text here is very uncertain. I follow Allies.</note>
<note type="footnote">486 It is evident that the Latin text here is corrupt in more places than one. There would seem to be no doubt
that for Migne’s reading quæ sibi, the Greek translators had quæ si ibi and accordingly rendered it ἅτινα ἐὰν
ἐκεῖ, and so the text stands in Labbe and Cossart. The following sentence is also clearly in a somewhat altered
form from its original.</note>
<note type="footnote">487 L. and C. insert here wrongly a nisi.</note>

<pb n="1019"/>
here, we have desired that there should be brought to us from the Eastern Churches copies
of the decrees, for it is said that there correct copies of the decrees are to be found. For
which end we beg your reverence, that you would deign yourself also to write to the pontiffs
of these parts, that is of the churches of Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople,488 and
to any others also if it shall please your holiness, that thence there may come to us the same
canons decreed by the Fathers in the city of Nice, and thus you would confer by the help of
the Lord this most great benefit upon all the churches of the West. For who can doubt that
the copies of the Nicene Council gathered in the Greek empire are most accurate, which
although brought together from so diverse and from such noble Greek churches are found
to agree when compared together? And until this be done, the provisions laid down to us
in the Commonitory aforesaid, concerning the appeals of bishops to the pontiff of the Roman
Church and concerning the causes of clerics which should be terminated by the bishops of
their own provinces, we are willing to allow to be observed until the proof arrives and we
trust your blessedness will help us in this according to the will of God. The rest of the matters
treated and defined in our synod, since the aforesaid brethren, our fellow bishop Faustinus,
and the presbyters Philip and Asellus are carrying the acts with them, if you deign to receive
them, will make known to your holiness. And they signed.489 Our Lord keep thee to us for
many years, most blessed brother. Alypius, Augustine, Possidius, Marinus and the rest of
the bishops (217) also signed.</p>

<p>Here beginneth the epistle of the African synod to Pope Celestine, bishop of the City of
Rome.</p>
<p>To the lord and most beloved and our honourable brother Celestine, Aurelius, Palatinus,
Antony, Totus, Servusdei, Terentius, Fortunatus, Martin, Januarius, Optatus, Ceticius,
Donatus, Theasius, Vincent, Fortunatian, and the rest of us, assembled at Carthage in the
General Council of Africa.</p>
<p>We could wish that, like as your Holiness intimated to us, in your letter sent by our
fellow presbyter Leo, your pleasure at the arrival of Apiarius, so we also could send to you
these writings with pleasure respecting his clearing. Then in truth both our own satisfaction,
and yours of late would be more reasonable; nor would that lately expressed by you concerning
the hearing of him then to come, as well as that already past, seem hasty and inconsiderate.
Upon the arrival, then, of our holy Brother and fellow-Bishop Faustinus, we assembled
a council, and believed that he was sent with that man, in order that, as he <del>Apiarius</del> had
before been restored to the presbyterate by his assistance, so now he might with his exertions
be cleared of the very great crimes charged against him by the inhabitants of Tabraca. But
the due course of examination in our council discovered in him such great and monstrous
crimes as to overbear even Faustinus, who acted rather as an advocate of the aforementioned
person than as a judge, and to prevail against what was more the zeal of a defender, than
the justice of an inquirer. For first he vehemently opposed the whole assembly, inflicting
on us many injuries, under pretence of asserting the privileges of the Roman Church, and
wishing that he should be received into communion by us, on the ground that your Holiness,
believing him to have appealed, though unable to prove it, had restored him to communion.
But this we by no means allowed, as you will also better see by reading the acts. After
however, a most laborious inquiry carried on for three days, during which in the greatest
affliction we took cognizance of various charges against him, God the just Judge, strong and
long suffering, cut short by a sudden stroke both the delays of our fellow-bishop Faustinus
and the evasions of Apiarius himself, by which he was endeavouring to veil his foul
enormities. For his strong and shameless obstinacy was overcome, by which he endeavoured
to cover, through an impudent denial, the mire of his lusts, and God so wrought upon his
conscience and published, even to the eyes of men, the secret crimes which he was already
condemning in that man’s heart, a very sty of wickedness, that, after his false denial he
suddenly burst forth into a confession of all the crimes he was charged with, and at length
convicted himself of his own accord of all infamies beyond belief, and changed to groans
even the hope we had entertained, believing and desiring that he might be cleared from such
shameful blots, except indeed that it was so far a relief to our sorrow, that he had delivered

<pb n="1024"/>
us from the labour of a longer inquiry, and by confession had applied some sort of remedy
to his own wounds, though, lord and brother, it was unwilling, and done with a struggling
conscience. Premising, therefore, our due regards to you, we earnestly conjure you, that
for the future you do not readily admit to a hearing persons coming hence, nor choose to
receive to your communion those who have been excommunicated by us, because you,
venerable Sir, will readily perceive that this has been prescribed even by the Nicene council.
For though this seems to be there forbidden in respect of the inferior clergy, or the laity,
how much more did it will this to be observed in the case of bishops, lest those who had
been suspended from communion in their own Province might seem to be restored to
communion hastily or unfitly by your Holiness. Let your Holiness reject, as is worthy of
you, that unprincipled taking shelter with you of presbyters likewise, and the inferior clergy,
both because by no ordinance of the Fathers hath the Church of Africa been deprived of
this authority, and the Nicene decrees have most plainly committed not only the clergy of
inferior rank, but the bishops themselves to their own Metropolitans. For they have ordained
with great wisdom and justice, that all matters should be terminated in the places where
they arise; and did not think that the grace of the Holy Spirit would be wanting to any
Province, for the bishops of Christ (Sacerdotibus) wisely to discern, and firmly to maintain
the right: especially since whosoever thinks himself wronged by any judgment may appeal
to the council of his Province, or even to a General Council [i.e. of Africa] unless it be imagined
that God can inspire a single individual with justice, and refuse it to an innumerable
multitude of bishops (sacerdotum) assembled in council. And how shall we be able to rely
on a sentence passed beyond the sea, since it will not be possible to send thither the necessary
witnesses, whether from the weakness of sex, or advanced age, or any other impediment?
For that your Holiness should send any on your part we can find ordained by no council of
Fathers. Because with regard to what you have sent us by the same our brother bishop
Faustinus, as being contained in the Nicene Council, we can find nothing of the kind in the
more authentic copies of that council, which we have received from the holy Cyril our
brother, Bishop of the Alexandrine Church, and from the venerable Atticus the Prelate of
Constantinople, and which we formerly sent by Innocent the presbyter, and Marcellus the
subdeacon through whom we received them, to Boniface the Bishop, your predecessor of
venerable memory. Moreover whoever desires you to delegate any of your clergy to execute
your orders, do not comply, lest it seem that we are introducing the pride of secular
dominion into the Church of Christ which exhibiteth to all that desire to see God the light
of simplicity and the day of humility. For now that the miserable Apiarius has been removed
out of the Church of Christ for his horrible crimes, we feel confident respecting our brother
Faustinus, that through the uprightness and moderation of your Holiness, Africa, without

<pb n="1025"/>
violating brotherly charity, will by no means have to endure him any longer. Lord and
brother, may our Lord long preserve your Holiness to pray for us.497</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXXVIII.</p>
<p>Those excommunicated by us, ye are not be willing to admit afterwards to communion,
according to the decree of the Nicene Synod. For Apiarius, who was restored by you, has resisted
the Synod, and treated it with scorn, and at length has been converted and confessed himself
guilty with sighs and tears.</p>

<p>The acts of this Council are found in Balsamon, page 761 of the Paris edition, with

from which the following translation is made. There is another version extant in Leunclavius,

<p>On September the twenty-ninth of the year 394, a magnificent church, dedicated to SS.
Peter and Paul, built by the munificence of Rufinus the Prætoreal prefect, and situated at a
place called “the Oaks,” a suburb of Chalcedon, was consecrated. Most scholars have adopted
Tillemont’s suggestion that this was the occasion which brought the patriarchs of Alexandria
and Antioch to Constantinople, and that occasion was taken advantage of to hold a synod
with regard to the dispute as to the see of Bostra. At this council, in accordance with the
canon of the Second Ecumenical Council, adopted only a dozen years before, Constantinople
took the first place and its bishop presided, but so strong was the hold of Alexandria that
three centuries afterwards the Quinisext Synod speaks of this council as held “under Nectarius
and Theophilus.” In passing it may not be amiss to remark that St. Gregory of Nyssa
and Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Flavian were present at this council! Well may Tillemont499
exclaim, “It is remarkable to see Theophilus there with Flavian, although they were
not in communion with each other.”</p>

<p>(Found in Beveridge, Synodicon. Tom. I., p. 678; Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. II., col.
1151. Both taken from Balsamon.)</p>
<p>In the consulate of our most religious and beloved-of-God Emperors, Flavius Arcadius
Augustus, for the third time, and Honorius for the second time, on the third day before the
calends of October, in the baptistery of the most holy church of Constantinople, when the
most holy bishops had taken their seats <del>here follow the names</del>, Nectarius, the bishop of
Constantinople, said: Since by the grace of God this synod has met in this holy place, if the
synod of my holy brethren and fellow ministers in holy things thinks good, since I see our
brothers Bagadius and Agapius, who contend between themselves about the bishopric of
Bostra, are also present, let these begin to set forth their mutual rights. And after some
things had been done by them for the sake of this cause, and it had been shewn that the
afore-named Bagadius was deposed by only two bishops, both of whom were dead, Arabianus,
bishop of Ancyra, said: Not on account of this judgment, but fearing henceforth for my
whole life, I desire the holy Synod to make a decree, whether or no, a bishop can be deposed
by only two bishops, and whether the Metropolitan is absent or not, without prejudice to
the present cause. For I fear that some, taking their power from these acts, may dare to attempt
such things. I wish therefore your response.</p>
<p>Nectarius, the bishop of Constantinople, said: The most religious bishop Arabianus
hath spoken most laudably. But since it is impossible to go backward in judgment, let us,
without condemning that which is past, establish things for the future. Arabianus, bishop
of Ancyra, said: The synod of blessed fathers who met at Nice condemns what has taken
place, for it orders that not less than three shall ordain, nor even so without the metropolitan.
But of the future I, full of fear, have made this question. I would wish therefore that you
would say clearly and without delay or doubt, that a bishop could not, according to the decree
of the Synod of Nice, lawfully be ordained or deposed by two men.</p>
<p>And, after some further debate, Theophilus, the bishop of Alexandria, said: Against
those who have gone forth, no sentence of indignation can be pronounced, since those to
be condemned were not present. But if any one were to consider those who are to be deposed
in future, it seems to me that not only these ought to assemble, but so far as possible all the
other provincials, that by the sentence of many there may be rendered a more accurate
condemnation of him who is present and is being judged, and who deserves deposition.
Nectarius, the bishop of Constantinople, said: Since, the controversy is concerning legitimate
institutions and decrees, it follows that nothing must be decreed on account of personal

<pb n="1029"/>
causes. Wherefore as the most holy bishop Arabianus has said, wishing to make the future
certain, the sentence of the most holy bishop Theophilus hath consistently and considerately
decreed that for the future it shall be lawful not even for three, far less for two bishops to
depose him who is examined as a defendant: but by the sentence of the greater synod and
of the bishops of the province, according to the Apostolic Canons. Flavian, the bishop of
Antioch, said: What things the most holy bishop Nectarius, and the most holy bishop
Theophilus have set forth are clearly right. And all the ecclesiastics agreed with these.</p>

<p>As Bagadius, the bishop of Bostra, had been deposed by only two bishops, the matter
was considered in the synod at Constantinople, whether that deposition had been rightly
decreed. Agapius, the elect, laying claim to it under the decision. And it was decreed that
the deposition was not canonical, since not two but a number should judge of those accusations
which are made against bishops. But know that this constitution has no force to-day,
for by the twelfth canon of the synod of Carthage, which is much later, crimes charged
against bishops are to be judged of by twelve bishops. Read that canon, and know that this
synod was held in the time of the Emperor Arcadius, while that of Carthage was in the days
of Theodosius the younger.</p>

<head>Introductory Note.</head>
<p>It is commonly supposed by the commentators that what follows is the “Canon of St.
Cyprian” referred to in the Second canon of the Synod in Trullo. Johnson500 thinks that
that canon comes down to us as Canon XXXIX. of the Apostolic Canons. Baronius501 agrees
with Asseman502 in thinking that from hatred to Rome the Greeks adopted the theory of
the non-validity of heretical baptism. “But,” as Hefele503 well remarks, “in that case they
would have contradicted themselves.”</p>
<p>Zonaras remarks: “This is the most ancient of all the synods. For that which was held
at Antioch in Syria concerning Paul of Samosata was more ancient than the others, being
holden in the time of the Roman Emperor Aurelius, but this one is still earlier. For the great
Cyprian finished his martyr course in the time of the Emperor Decius: but there was a long
interval between Aurelian and Decius. For many emperors reigned after the death of Decius,
to whom at last Aurelian succeeded on the throne. Therefore this is by far the most ancient
of all synods. In it moreover above eighty-four bishops were gathered together, and considered
the question as to what was to be done about the baptism of those who came to the
Church after abandoning their heresies, and of schismatics who returned to the Church.”</p>

<head>The Synod held at Carthage over which presided the Great and Holy
Martyr Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage.</head>
<p>a.d. 257.</p>
<p>(Found in Beveridge, Synodicon, Tom. I., p. 365, and in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom.
I., col. 786.)</p>
<p>When very many bishops were met together at Carthage on the Calends of September
from the province of Africa, Numidia and Mauritania, with the presbyters and deacons (the
greater part of the people being likewise present) and when the holy letters of Jubaianus to
Cyprian had been read, and Cyprian’s answers to Jubaianus, concerning heretical baptisms,
as well as what the same Jubaianus afterwards wrote to Cyprian,</p>
<p>Cyprian said: Ye have heard, my dearly beloved colleagues, what our fellow bishop
Jubaianus has written to me, taking counsel of my littleness concerning the illicit and profane
baptisms of heretics, and the answer which I made him; being of the same opinion as we
have been on former occasions, that heretics coming to the Church should be baptized and
sanctified with the Church’s baptism. Moreover there has been read to you also the other
letter of Jubaianus, in which answering for his sincere and pious devotion to our letter, not
only he agrees therewith but offered thanks that he has been so instructed by it. It only remains
therefore that we, each one of us, one by one, say what our mind is in this matter,
without condemning any one or removing any one from the right of communion who does
not agree with us.</p>
<p>For no one <del>of us504</del> has set himself up <del>to be</del> bishop <del>of bishops</del>,505 or attempted
with tyrannical dread to force his colleagues to obedience to him, since every bishop has,
for the license of liberty and power, his own will, and as he cannot be judged by another, so
neither can he judge another. But we await the judgment of our universal Lord, our Lord
Jesus Christ, who one and alone hath the power, both of advancing us in the governance of
his Church, and of judging of our actions <del>in that position</del>.</p>
<p><del>The bishops then one by one declared against heretical baptism.506 Last of all (col. 796)</del>:</p>
<p>Cyprian, the Confessor and Martyr of Carthage, said: The letter which was written to

<p>Zonaras.</p>
<p>These are the opinions therefore of the fathers, which assembled in council with the
great Cyprian: but they do not apply to all heretics nor to all schismatics. For the Second
Ecumenical Council, as we have just said <del>i.e. in the Preface he has placed to the acts of the
synod. Vide L. and C., Conc., Tom. i., col. 801</del> makes an exception of some heretics, and
give its sanction to their reception without baptism, only requiring their anointing with the
holy chrism, and then anathematizing at the same time their own and all heresies.</p>
<p>Balsamon does not print the acts of the Council at all but only the letter of St. Cyprian
(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. I., col. 799.) I have not thought it worth while to place
here the remarks of the eighty-six bishops, ὡς μὴ ἀναγκαῖαι, οἷα μὴδε ἐνεργοῦσαι, to quote
Zonaras’s words.</p>

<p>The allusion here is to the decree of Stephen, who was wont, according to the custom
of his elders, to be styled “Bishop of bishops,” and because he had acrimoniously threatened

<head>Epistle LXX.</head>
<p>Cyprian, Liberalis, Caldonius, etc., to their brethren Januarius, etc. Greeting.</p>
<p>When we were together in council, dearest brethren, we read the letter which you addressed
to us respecting those who are thought to be baptized by heretics and schismatics,
whether, when they come to the one true Catholic Church, they ought to be baptized.
Wherein, although ye yourselves also hold the Catholic rule in its truth and fixedness, yet
since, out of our mutual affection, ye have thought good to consult us, we deliver not our
sentence as though new but, by a kindred harmony, we unite with you in that long since
settled by our predecessors, and observed by us; thinking, namely, and holding for certain,
that no one can be baptized without the Church, in that there is one Baptism appointed in
the holy Church, and it is written, the Lord himself speaking, “They have forsaken me, the
Fountain of living water, and hewed them out broken cisterns that can hold no water.”
Again, holy Scripture admonishes us, and says, “Keep thee from the strange water, and drink
not from a fountain of strange water.” The water then must first be cleansed and sanctified
by the priest, that it may be able, by Baptism therein, to wash away the sins of the baptized,
for the Lord says by the prophet Ezekiel, “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and
ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you; a new
heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.” But how can he cleanse
and sanctify the water, who is himself unclean, and with whom the Spirit is not? whereas
the Lord says in Numbers, “And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean.”
Or how can he that baptizeth give remission of sins to another, who cannot himself free
himself from his own sins, out of the Church?</p>
<p>Moreover, the very interrogatory which is put in Baptism, is a witness of the truth. For
when we say, “Dost thou believe in eternal life, and remission of sins through the holy
Church?” we mean, that remission of sins is not given, except in the Church; but that, with
heretics, where the Church is not, sins cannot be remitted. They, therefore, who claim that
heretics can baptize, let them either change the interrogatory, or maintain the truth; unless
indeed they ascribe a Church also to those who they contend have Baptism.</p>
<p>Anointed also must he of necessity be, who is baptized, that having received the
chrism—that is, unction, he may be the anointed of God, and have within him the grace of
Christ. Moreover, it is the Eucharist through which the baptized are anointed, the oil
sanctified on the altar. But he cannot sanctify the creature of oil, who has neither altar nor
church. Whence neither can the spiritual unction be with heretics, since it is acknowledged
that the oil cannot be sanctified nor the Eucharist celebrated among them. But we ought
to know and remember that it is written, “Let not the oil of a sinner anoint my head;” which
the Holy Ghost forewarned in the Psalms, lest any, quitting the track, and wandering out
of the path of truth, be anointed by heretics and adversaries of Christ. Moreover, when

<pb n="1035"/>
baptized, what kind of prayer can a profane priest and a sinner offer? in that it is written,
“God heareth not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him
he heareth.”</p>
<p>But who can give what himself hath not? or how can he perform spiritual acts, who hath
himself lost the Holy Spirit? Wherefore he is to be baptized and received, who comes uninitiated
to the Church, that within he may be hallowed through the holy; for it is written, “Be
ye holy, for I am holy, saith the Lord.” So that he who has been seduced into error and
washed without should, in the true Baptism of the Church, put off this very thing also; that
he, a man coming to God, while seeking for a priest, fell, through the deceit of error, upon
one profane. But to acknowledge any case where they have baptized, is to approve the
baptism of heretics and schismatics.</p>
<p>For neither can part of what they do be void and part avail. If he could baptize, he could
also give the Holy Ghost. But if he cannot give the Holy Ghost because, being set without,
he is not with the Holy Ghost, neither can he baptize any that cometh: for that there is both
one Baptism, and one Holy Ghost, and one Church, founded by Christ the Lord upon Peter,
through an original and principle of unity; so it results, that since all among them is void
and false, nothing that they have done ought to be approved by us. For what can be ratified
and confirmed by God, which they do whom the Lord calls his enemies and adversaries,
propounding in his Gospel, “He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth
not with me, scattereth.” And the blessed Apostle John also, keeping the commandments
and precepts of the Lord, has written in his Epistle, “Ye have heard that Antichrist shall
come; even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time. They
went out from us, but were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have
continued with us.” Whence we, too, ought to infer and consider, whether they who are
the adversaries of the Lord, and are called Antichrists, can give the grace of Christ.
Wherefore we who are with the Lord, and who hold the unity of the Lord, and according
to this vouchsafement administer his priesthood in the Church, ought to repudiate and reject
and account as profane, whatever his adversaries and Antichrists do; and to those who,
coming from error and wickedness, acknowledge the true faith of the one Church, we should
impart the reality of unity and faith by all the sacraments of Divine grace.</p>
<p>We bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<pb n="1037"/>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>Gibbon thus describes the Seventh Ecumenical Council of the Christian Church: “The
decrees were framed by the president507 Tarasius, and ratified by the acclamations and
subscriptions of three hundred and fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced that the
worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to the Fathers and councils of the
Church; but they hesitated whether that worship be relative or direct; whether the godhead
and the figure of Christ be entitled to the same mode of adoration.508 Of this second Nicene
Council the acts are still extant; a curious monument of superstition and ignorance, of
falsehood and folly.” (Decline and Fall, chapter xlix.)</p>
<p>And this has been read as history, and has passed as such in the estimation of the overwhelming
majority of educated English-speaking people for several generations, and yet it
is a statement as full of absolute and inexcusable errors as the passage in another part of the
same work which the late Bishop Lightfoot so unmercifully exposed, and which the most
recent editor, Bury, has taken pains to correct.</p>
<p>I do not know whether it is worth while to do so, but perhaps it may be as well to state,
that whatever may be his opinion of the truths of the conclusions arrived at by the council,
no impartial reader can fail to recognize the profound learning509 of the assembly, the singular
acumen displayed in the arguments employed, and the remarkable freedom from what
Gibbon and many others would consider “superstition.” So radical is this that Gibbon would
have noticed it had he read the acts of the synod he is criticising (which we have good reason
for believing that he never did). There he would have found the Patriarch declaring that at
that time the venerable images worked no miracles, a statement that would be made by no
prelate of the Latin or Greek Church to-day, even in the light of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>As I have noted in the previous pages my task is not that of a controversialist. To me
at present it is a matter of no concern whether the decision of the council is true or false. I
shall therefore strictly confine myself to two points: 1. That the Council was Ecumenical.
2. What its decision was; explaining the technical meaning of the Greek words employed
during this controversy and finally incorporated in the decree.</p>
<note type="footnote">507 Who was possibly at least not the president, vide Michaud, Sept. Conc. OEuméniques, p. 330.</note>
<note type="footnote">508 Worship is “relative” or “absolute,” what Gibbon means by “direct” would be hard to say. How entirely
false the whole statement is, Gibbon himself would have recognized had he read the acts.</note>
<note type="footnote">509 Dr. Neale complains that the acts display a painful lack of critical knowledge and that several spurious
passages are attributed to the Fathers. But I confess this does not seem to me either surprising or disgraceful.
The attributing of books, even in our critical days, to persons who were not their authors is not so uncommon
as to make us wonder such a thing might have occurred in such stormy times, when learning of this sort must
have suffered by the adversities of the Church and State, the Iconoclastic persecutions and the Moslem incursions.</note>

<pb n="1038"/>
<p>1. This Council was certainly Ecumenical.</p>
<p>It seems strange that any person familiar with the facts of the case could for a moment
entertain a doubt as to the ecumenical character of the council which met at Nice in 787.</p>
<p>(a) It was called by the Roman Emperors to be an Ecumenical Council. Vide letter of
Tarasius.</p>
<p>(b) It was called with the approval of the Pope (not like I. Constantinople, without his
knowledge; or like Chalcedon, contrary to his expressed wish), and two papal legates were
present at its deliberations and signed its decrees.</p>
<p>(c) The Patriarch of Constantinople was present in person.</p>
<p>(d) The other Patriarchates were represented, although on account of the Moslem
tyranny the Patriarchs could not attend in person, nor could they even send proctors.</p>
<p>(e) The decrees were adopted by an unanimous vote of the three hundred and fifty
bishops.</p>
<p>(f) They were immediately received in all the four Eastern Patriarchates.510</p>
<p>(g) They were immediately accepted by the Pope.</p>
<p>(h) For a full thousand years they have been received by the Latin and Greek Churches
with but a few exceptions altogether insignificant, save the Frankish kingdom.</p>
<p>In the face of such undisputed facts, it would be strange were anyone to doubt the historical
fact that the Second Council of Nice is one of the Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic
Church, and indeed so far as I am aware none have done so except such as have been
forced into this position for doctrinal consistency.</p>
<p>Nor have all Protestants allowed their judgment to be warped in this matter. As a sample
I may quote from that stanch Protestant whom Queen Elizabeth appointed a chaplain in
ordinary in 1598, and who in 1610 was made Dean of Gloucester, the profoundly learned
Richard Field. In his famous “Book of the Church” (Book V. chap. lj.), he says: “These”
<del>six, which he had just described</del> “were all the lawful General Councils (lawful, I say, both
in their beginning and proceeding and continuance) that ever were holden in the Christian
Church, touching matters of faith. For the Seventh, which is the Second of Nice, was not
called about any question of faith but of manners. So that there are but Seven General
Councils that the whole Church acknowledgeth, called to determine matters of faith and
manners. For the rest that were holden afterwards, which our adversaries <del>the Roman
Catholics</del> would have to be acknowledged general, they are not only rejected by us but by
the Grecians also, as not general, but patriarchal only, etc.”</p>
<note type="footnote">510 “It is certain,” confesses Dr. Neale (History of the Holy Eastern Church, Vol. II., p. 113; in his attempt to
overthrow the authority of this council) “that Politian approved (S. Theod. Stud. Ep. xviij.) although he was not
present at the council of Nicæa; and the controversy, which had never much disturbed Africa, may henceforth
be considered as terminated in the Diocese of Alexandria.”</note>

<pb n="1039"/>
<p>Of course there are a number of writers (principally of the Anglican Communion), who
have argued thus: “The doctrine taught by the Second Council of Nice we reject, ergo it
cannot have been an Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church.” And they have then
gone on to prove their conclusion. With such writers I have no concern. My simple contention
is that the Council is admitted by all to have been representative of East and West,
and to have been accepted for a thousand years as such, and to be to-day accepted as Ecumenical
by the Latin and Greek Churches. If its doctrines are false, then one of the Ecumenical
Synods set forth false doctrine, a statement which should give no trouble, so far as I can
understand, to anyone who does not hold the necessary infallibility of Ecumenical Synods.511</p>
<p>Among those who have argued against the ecumenical character of the Seventh Council
there are, however, two whose eminent learning and high standing demand a consideration
of anything they may advance on any subject they treat of, these are the Rev. John Mason
Neale and the Rev. Sir William Palmer.</p>
<p>Dr. Neale considers the matter at some length in a foot-note to his History of the Eastern
Church (Vol. II., pp. 132–135), but I think it not improper to remark that the author ingenuously
confesses in this very note that if he came to the conclusion that the council was ecumenical,
“it would be difficult to clear our own Church from the charge of heresy.” Entertaining
such an opinion at the start, his conclusion could hardly be unbiassed.</p>
<p>The only argument which is advanced in this note which is different from those of
other opponents of the Council, is that it had not the authentication of a subsequent Ecumenical
Synod. The argument seems to me so extraordinary that I think Dr. Neale’s exact
words should be cited: “In the first place, we may remark that the Second Council of Nicæa
wants one mark of authority, shared according to the more general belief by the six—according
to the opinions which an English Churchman must necessarily embrace by the first five
Councils—its recognition as Ecumenical by a later Council undoubtedly so.” But surely
this involves an absurdity, for if it is not known whether the last one is ecumenical or no,
how will its approval of the next to the last give that council any certainty? If III. Constantinople
is doubtful being the sixth, because there is no seventh to have confirmed it;
then II. Constantinople, the fifth, is doubtful because it has only been confirmed by a synod
itself doubtful and so on, which is absurd. The test of the ecumenicity of a council is not
its acceptance by a subsequent synod, but its acceptance by the whole Church, and this Dr.
Neale frankly confesses is the case with regard to II. Nice: “It cannot be denied,” he admits,
“that at the present day both the Eastern and the Latin Churches receive it as Ecumenical”
<note type="footnote">511 As a sample of all that bigotry and dishonesty can do when writing on such a subject, the reader is referred
to a little book by the Rev. F. Meyrick (a canon of the Church of England) published in Paris for the Anglo-
Continental Society, 1877, entitled, Du Schisme d’Orient et de l’authorité du prétendu septième concile.</note>

<pb n="1040"/>
(p. 132). He might have added, “and have done so without any controversy on the subject
for nearly a thousand years.”</p>
<p>I do not think there is any need of my delaying longer over Dr. Neale’s note, which I
have noticed at all only because of his profound scholarship, and not because on this particular
point I thought he had thrown any new light upon the matter, nor urged any argument
really calling for an answer.</p>
<p>Sir William Palmer’s argument (A Treatise on the Church of Christ, Pt. IV., Chapter X.,
Sect. IV.) is one of much greater force, and needs an answer. He points out how, long after
the Council of Nice, the number of the General Councils was still spoken of as being Six,
and that in some instances this council is referred to as the “pseudo” General Council of
Nice. Now at first sight this argument seems to be of great force. But upon further consideration
it will be seen to be after all of no great weight. We may not be able to explain, nor
are we called upon to do so, why in certain cases writers chose still to speak of Six instead
of Seven General Councils, but we would point out that the same continuance of the old
expression can be found with regard to others of the General Councils. For example, St.
Gregory the Great says that he “revered the four Ecumenical Councils as he did the four
Gospels,” but the fifth Ecumenical Synod had been held a number of years before. Will
anyone pretend from this to draw the conclusion that at that time the Ecumenical character
of the Fifth Synod (II. Constantinople) was not recognized at Rome? Moreover, among the
instances cited (and there are but a very few all told) one of them is fatal to the argument.
For if Pope Hadrian in 871 still speaks of only six Ecumenical Synods, he omits two (according
to Roman count), for this date is after the synod which deposed Photius—a synod rejected
indeed afterwards by the Greeks, but always accepted by the Latins as the Eighth of the
Ecumenical Councils. Would Sir William pretend for an instant that Hadrian and the
Church of Rome did not recognize that Council as Ecumenical and as the Eighth Synod?
He could not, for on page 208 he ingenuously confesses that that Council “had been approved
and confirmed by that Pope.”</p>
<p>But after all, the contention fails in its very beginning, for Sir William frankly recognizes
that the Popes from the first espoused the cause of the council and were ready to defend it.
Now this involved the acknowledgment of its ecumenical character, for it was called as an
Ecumenical Synod, this we expressly learn from the letter of Tarasius to the other Eastern
Patriarchs (Labbe, Conc., Tom. VII., col. 165), from the letter of the Emperor and Empress
to the bishops throughout the empire (L. and C., Conc., Tom. VII., col. 53), and (above all)
from the witness of the Council itself, assuming the style of the “Holy Ecumenical Synod.”
In the face of such evidence any further proof is surely uncalled for.</p>
<p>We come now to the only other argument brought against the ecumenical character of
this council—to wit, that many writers, even until after the beginning of the XVIth century,
call the Seventh a “pseudo-Council.” But surely this proves too much, for it would seem to

<pb n="1041"/>
imply that even down to that time the cultus of images was not established in the West, a
proposition too ridiculous to be defended by anyone. It is indeed worthy of notice that all
the authors cited are Frankish, (1) the Annales Francorum (a.d. 808) in the continuation of
the same (a.d. 814), in an anonymous life of Charlemagne, and the Annales written after
819; (2) Eginhard in his Annales Francorum (a.d. 829); (3) the Gallican bishops at Paris,
824;512 (4) Hincmar of Rheims; (5) Ado, bishop of Vienne (died 875); (6) Anastasius acknowledges
that the French had not accepted the veneration of the sacred images; (7) The
Chronicle of St. Bertinus (after 884); (8) The Annales Francorum after the council still speak
of it as pseudo; (9) Regino, Abbot of Prum (circa 910); (10) the Chronicle of St. Bertinus, of
the Xth Century. (11) Hermanus Contractus: (12) the author who continued the Gestes
Francorum to a.d. 1165; (13) Roger Hoverden (a.d. 1204); (14) Conrade à Lichtenau, Abbot
of Urspurg (circa 1230); (15) Matthew of Westminster.</p>
<p>No doubt to these, given in Palmer, who has made much use of Lannoy, others could
be added; but they are enough to shew that the council was very little known, and that none
of these writers had ever seen its acts.</p>
<p>Sir William is of opinion that by what precedes in his book he has “proved that for at
least five centuries and a half the Council of Nice remained rejected in the Western Church.”
I venture to think that the most he has proved is that during that period of time he has been
able to find fifteen individuals who for one reason or another wrote rejecting that council,
that is to say three in a century, a number which does not seem quite sufficient to make the
foundation of so considerable a generalization as “the Western Church.” The further conclusion
of Sir William, I think, every scholar will reject as simply preposterous, viz.: “In fact
the doctrine of the adoration of images <del>by which he means the doctrine taught by the II.
Council of Nice</del> was never received in the West, except where the influence of the Roman
See was predominant” (p. 211).</p>
<p>Sir William is always, however, honest, and the following quotation which he himself
makes from Cardinal Bellarmine may well go far toward explaining the erroneous or imperfect
statements he has so learnedly and laboriously gathered together. “Bellarmine says: ‘It
is very credible that St. Thomas, Alexander of Hales, and other scholastic doctors had not
seen the second synod of Nice, nor the eighth general synod;’ he adds that they ‘were long
in obscurity, and were first published in our own age, as may be known from their not being
extant in the older volumes of the councils; and St. Thomas and the other ancient schoolmen
never make any mention of this Nicene Synod.’ (Bell. De Imag. Sanct. Lib. II. cap. xxij.)”</p>
<p>2. What the Council decreed.</p>
<note type="footnote">512 The true date is 825.</note>

<pb n="1042"/>
<p>The council decreed that similar veneration and honour should be paid to the representations
of the Lord and of the Saints as was accustomed to be paid to the “laurata” and
tablets representing the Christian emperors, to wit, that they should be bowed to, and saluted
with kisses, and attended with lights and the offering of incense.513 But the Council was
most explicit in declaring that this was merely a veneration of honour and affection, such
as can be given to the creature, and that under no circumstances could the adoration of divine
worship be given to them but to God alone.</p>
<p>The Greek language has in this respect a great advantage over the Hebrew, the Latin
and the English; it has a word which is a general word and is properly used of the affectionate
regard and veneration shown to any person or thing, whether to the divine Creator or to
any of his creatures, this word is προσκύνησις; it has also another word which can properly
be used to denote only the worship due to the most high, God, this word is λατρεία. When
then the Council defined that the worship of “latria “was never to be given to any but God
alone, it cut off all possibility for idolatry, mariolatry, iconolatry, or any other “latry” except
“theo-latry.” If therefore any of these other “latries” exist or ever have existed, they exist or
have existed not in accordance with, but in defiance of, the decree of the Second Council of
Nice.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, as I have said, we have neither in Hebrew, Latin, nor English any
word with this restricted meaning, and therefore when it became necessary to translate the
Greek acts and the decree, great difficulty was experienced, and by the use of “adoro” as the
equivalent of προσκυνέω many were scandalized, thinking that it was divine adoration
which they were to give to the sacred images, which they knew would be idolatry. The same
trouble is found in rendering into English the acts and decrees; for while indeed properly
speaking “worship” no more means necessarily divine worship in English than “adoratio”
does in Latin (e.g. I. Chr. xxix. 20, “All the congregation bowed down their heads and worshipped
the Lord and the King” <del>i.e. Solomon</del>; Luke xiv. 10, “Then shalt thou have worship
in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee”), yet to the popular mind “the worship
of images” is the equivalent of idolatry. In the following translations I have uniformly
translated as follows and the reader from the English will know what the word is in the original.</p>
<p>Προσκυνέω, to venerate; τιμάω, to honour; λατρεύω, to adore; ἀσπάζομαι, to salute;
δουλεύω, to serve; εἰκών, an image.</p>
<p>The relative force of προσκύνησις and λατρεία cannot better be set forth than by
Archbishop Trench’s illustration of two circles having the same centre, the larger including
the less (New Testament Synonyms, sub voce Λατρεύω).</p>
<note type="footnote">513 Vide Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, tom. vii., col. 59.</note>

<pb n="1043"/>
<p>To make this matter still clearer I must ask the reader’s attention to the use of the words
abadh and shachah in the Hebrew; the one abadh, which finds, when used with reference
to God or to false gods its equivalent in λατρεύω; the other shachah, which is represented
by προσκυνέω . Now in the Old Testament no distinction in the Hebrew is drawn between
these words when applied to creator or creature. The one denotes service primarily for hire;
the other bowing down and kissing the hand to any in salutation. Both words are constantly
used and sometimes refer to the Creator and sometimes to the creature—e.g., we read that
Jacob served (abadh) Laban (Gen. xxix. 20); and that Joshua commanded the people not to
serve the gods of their fathers but to serve (abadh) the Lord (Josh. xxiv. 14). And for the
use of shachah the following may suffice: “And all the congregation blessed the Lord God
of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped (Hebrew, shachah; Greek,
προσκυνέω ; Latin, adoro) the Lord and the King” (I. Chr. xxix. 20). But while it is true of
the Hebrew of the Old Testament that there is no word which refers alone to Divine Worship
this is not true of the Septuagint Greek nor of the Greek of the New Testament, for in both
προσκυνέω has always its general meaning, sometimes applying to the creature and sometimes
to the Creator; but λατρεύω is used to denote divine worship alone, as St. Augustine
pointed out long ago.</p>
<p>This distinction comes out very clearly in the inspired translation of the Hebrew found
in Matthew iv. 10, “Thou shalt worship (προσκυνήσεις) the Lord thy God, and him only
shalt thou serve (λατρεύσεις ).” “Worship” was due indeed to God above all but not exclusively
to him, but latria is to be given to “him only.”514</p>
<p>I think I have now said enough to let the reader understand the doctrine taught by the
council and to prove that in its decree it simply adopted the technical use of words found
in the Greek of the Septuagint and of the New Testament. I may then close this introduction
with a few remarks upon outward acts of veneration in general.</p>
<p>Of course, the outward manifestation in bodily acts of reverence will vary with times
and with the habits of peoples. To those accustomed to kiss the earth on which the Emperor
had trodden, it would be natural to kiss the feet of the image of the King of Kings. The same
is manifestly true of any outward acts whatever, such as bowing, kneeling, burning of lights,
and offering of incense. All these when offered before an image are, according to the mind
of the Council, but outward signs of the reverence due to that which the image represents
and pass backward to the prototype, and thus it defined, citing the example of the serpent
in the wilderness, of which we read, “For he that turned himself toward it was not saved by
the thing that he saw, but by thee, that art the Saviour of all” (Wisdom xvi. 17). If anyone
feels disposed to attribute to outward acts any necessary religious value he is falling back
into Judaism, and it were well for him to remember that the nod which the Quakers adopted
<note type="footnote">514 Vide the Synod’s Letter to the Emperor and Empress.</note>

<pb n="1044"/>
out of protest to the bow of Christians was once the expression of divine worship to the
most sacred idols; that in the Eastern Church the priest only bows before the Lord believed
to be present in the Holy Sacrament while he prostrates himself before the infidel Sultan;
and that throughout the Latin communion the acolytes genuflect before the Bishop, as they
pass him, with the same genuflection that they give to the Holy Sacrament upon the Altar.
In this connexion I quote in closing the fine satire in the letter of this very council to the
Emperor and Empress. St. Paul “says of Jacob (Heb. xi. 21), ‘He worshipped the top of his
staff,’ and like to this is that said by Gregory, surnamed the theologian, ‘Revere Bethlehem
and worship the manger.’ But who of those truly understanding the Divine Scriptures would
suppose that here was intended the Divine worship of latria? Such an opinion could only
be entertained by an idiot or one ignorant of Scriptural and Patristic knowledge. Would
Jacob give divine worship to his staff? Or would Gregory, the theologian, give command
to worship as God a manger!”515</p>

<p>They who receive the dignity of the empire, or the honour of the principal priesthood
from our Lord Jesus Christ, ought to provide and to care for those things which please him,
and rule and govern the people committed to their care according to his will and good
pleasure.</p>
<p>Therefore, O most holy Head (Caput), it is incumbent upon us and you, that irreprehensibly
we know the things which be his, and that in these we exercise ourselves, since
from him we have received the imperatorial dignity, and you the dignity of the chief
priesthood.</p>
<p>But now to speak more to the point. Your paternal blessedness knows what hath been
done in times past in this our royal city against the venerable images, how those who reigned
immediately before us destroyed them and subjected them to disgrace and injury: (O may
it not be imputed to them, for it had been better for them had they not laid their hands upon
the Church!)—and how they seduced and brought over to their own opinion all the people
who live in these parts—yea, even the whole of the East, in like manner, up to the time in
which God hath exalted us to this kingdom, who seek his glory in truth, and hold that which
has been handed down by his Apostles together with all other teachers. Whence now with
pure heart and unfeigned religion we have, together with all our subjects and our most
learned divines, had constant conferences respecting the things which relate to God, and
by their advice have determined to summon a General Council. And we entreat your paternal
blessedness, or rather the Lord God entreats, “who will have all men to be saved and to come
to the knowledge of the truth,” that you will give yourself to us and make no delay, but come
up hither to aid us in the confirmation and establishment of the ancient tradition of venerable
images. It is, indeed, incumbent on your holiness to do this, since you know how it is
written—“Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, ye priests, saith the Lord,” and “the lips of
the priest shall keep knowledge, and the law shall go forth out of his mouth, for he is the
angel of the Lord of Hosts.” And again, the divine Apostle, the preacher of the truth, who,
“from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum, preached the Gospel,” hath thus commanded—
“Feed with discipline the flock of Christ which he purchased with his own blood.”
As then you are the veritable chief priest (primus sacerdos) who presides in the place and in
<note type="footnote">516 “Divine” here, as usually in such connections, means “imperial.”</note>

the see of the holy and superlaudable Apostle Peter, let your paternal blessedness come to
us, as we have said before, and add your presence to all those other priests who shall be assembled
together here, that thus the will of the Lord may be accomplished. For as we are
taught in the Gospels our Lord saith—“When two or three are met together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them”—let your paternal and sacred blessedness be certified and
confirmed by the great God and King of all, our Lord Jesus Christ, and by us his servants,
that if you come up hither you shall be received with all honour and glory, and that everything
necessary for you shall be granted. And again, when the definition (capitulum) shall be
completed, which by the good pleasure of Christ our God we hope shall be done, we take
upon us to provide for you every facility of returning with honour and distinction. If,
however, your blessedness cannot attend upon us (which we can scarcely imagine, knowing
what is your zeal about divine things), at least, pray select for us men of understanding,
having with them letters from your holiness, that they may be present here in the person of
your sacred and paternal blessedness. So, when they meet with the other priests who are
here, the ancient tradition of our holy fathers may be synodically confirmed, and every evil
plant of tares may be rooted out, and the words of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ may
be fulfilled, that “the gates of hell shall not prevail against her.” And after this, may there
be no further schism and separation in the one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, of
which Christ our true God is the Head.</p>
<p>We have had Constantine, beloved in Christ, most holy Bishop of Leontina in our beloved
Sicily, with whom your paternal blessedness is well acquainted, into our presence; and,
having spoken with him face to face, have sent him with this our present venerable jussio
to you. Whom, after that he hath seen you, forthwith dismiss, that he may come back to
us, and write us by him concerning your coming—what time we may expect will be spent
in your journeying thence and coming to us. Moreover, he can retain with him the most
holy Bishop of Naples, and come up hither together with him. And, as your journey will
be by way of Naples and Sicily we have given orders to the Governor of Sicily about this,
that he take due care to have every needful preparation made for your honour and rest,
which is necessary in order that your paternal blessedness may come to us. Given on the
ivth before the calends of September, the seventh indiction, from the Royal City.</p>

<p>Read at the First Session.</p>
<p>(Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 49.)</p>
<p>Constantine and Irene—Sovereigns of the Romans in the Faith, to the most holy Bishops,
who, by the grace of God and by the command of our pious Sovereignty, have met together
in the Council of Nice.</p>
<p>The Wisdom which is truly according to the nature of God and the Father—our Lord
Jesus Christ, our true God—who, by his most divine and wonderful dispensation in the
flesh, hath delivered us from all idolatrous error: and, by taking on him our nature, hath
renewed the same by the co-operation of the Spirit, which is of the same nature with himself;
and having himself become the first High Priest, hath counted you holy men, worthy of the
same dignity.</p>
<p>He is that good Shepherd who, bearing on his own shoulders that wandering
sheep—fallen man, hath brought him back to his own peculiar folds—that is, the party of
angelic and ministering powers (Eph. ii. 14, 15), and hath reconciled us in himself and
having taken away the wall of partition, hath broken down the enmity through his flesh,
and hath bestowed upon us a rule of conduct tending to peace; wherefore, preaching to all,
he saith in the Gospel, Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of
God (Matt. v. 9). Of which blessedness, confirming as it does the exaltation of the adoption
of sons, our pious Sovereignty desiring above all things to be made partakers, hath ever applied
the utmost diligence to direct all our Roman Commonwealth into the ways of unity
and concord; and more especially have we been solicitous concerning the right regulation
of the Church of God, and most anxious in every way to promote the unity of the priesthood.
For which cause the Chiefs of the Sacerdotal Order of the East and of the North, of the West
and of the South, are present in the person of their Representative Bishops, who have with
them respectively the replies written in answers to the Synodical Epistle sent from the most
holy Patriarch; for such was from the beginning the synodical regulation of the Church
Catholic, which, from the one end of the earth to the other, hath received the Gospel. On
this account we have, by the good will and permission of God, caused you, his most holy
Priests, to meet together —you who are accustomed to dispense his Testimony in the unbloody
sacrifice—that your decision may be in accordance with the definitions of former
councils who decreed rightly, and that the splendour of the Spirit may illumine you in all
things, for, as our Lord teaches, No man lighteth a candle and putteth it under a bushel, but
on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house; even so, should ye make
such use of the various regulations which have been piously handed down to us of old by
our Fathers, that all the Holy Churches of God may remain in peaceful order.</p>

<pb n="1048"/>
<p>As for us, such was our zeal for the truth—such our earnest desire for the interests of
religion, our care for ecclesiastical order, our anxiety that the ancient rules and orders should
maintain their ground—that though fully engaged in military councils—though all our attention
was occupied in political cares—yet, treating all these affairs as but of minor importance,
we would allow nothing whatever to interfere with the convocation of your most holy
council. To every one is given the utmost freedom of expressing his sentiments without the
least hesitation, that thus the subject under enquiry may be most fully discussed and truth
may be the more boldly spoken, that so all dissensions may be banished from the Church
and we all may be united in the bonds of peace.</p>
<p>For, when the most holy Patriarch Paul, by the divine will, was about to be liberated
from the bands of mortality and to exchange his earthly pilgrimage for a heavenly home
with his Master Christ, he abdicated the Patriarchate and took upon him the monastic life,
and when we asked him, Why hast thou done this? he answered, Because I fear that, if death
should surprise me still in the episcopate of this royal and heaven-defended city, I should
have to carry with me the anathema of the whole Catholic Church, which consigns me to
that outer darkness which is prepared for the devil and his angels; for they say that a certain
synod hath been held here in order to the subversion of pictures and images which the
Catholic Church holds, embraces, and receives, in memory of the persons whom they represent.
This is that which distracts my soul—this is that which makes me anxiously to enquire
how I may escape the judgment of God—since among such men I have been brought up
and with such am I numbered. No sooner had he thus spoken in the presence of some of
our most illustrious nobles than he expired.</p>
<p>When our Pious Sovereignty reflected on this awful declaration (and truly, even before
this event, we had heard of similar questionings from many around), we took counsel with
ourselves as to what ought to be done; and we determined, after mature deliberation, that
when a new Patriarch had been elected, we should endeavour to bring this subject to some
decisive conclusion. Wherefore, having summoned those whom we knew to be most experienced
in ecclesiastical matters, and having called upon Christ our God, we consulted with
them who was worthy to be exalted to the chair of the Priesthood of this Royal and Godpreserved
city; and they all with one heart and soul gave their vote in favour of Tarasius—he
who now occupies the Pontifical Presidency. Having, therefore, sent for him, we laid before
him our deliberations and our vote; but he would by no means consent, nor at all yield to
that which had been determined. And when we enquired, Wherefore he thus refused his
consent?—at first he answered evasively, That the yoke of the Chief Priesthood was too
much for him. But we, knowing this to be a mere pretext coveting his unwillingness to obey
us, would not desist from our importunity, but persisted in pressing the acceptance of the
dignity of the Chief Priesthood upon him. When he found how urgent we were with him,
he told us the cause of his refusal. It is (said he) because I perceive that the Church which

<pb n="1049"/>
has been founded on the rock, Christ our God, is rent and torn asunder by schisms, and
that we are unstable in our confession, and that Christians in the East, of the same faith with
ourselves, decline communion with us, and unite them with those of the West; and so we
are estranged from all, and each day are anathematized by all: and, moreover, I should demand
that an Ecumenical Council should be held, at which should be found Legates from
the Pope of Rome and from the Chief Priests of the East. We, therefore, fully understanding
these things, introduced him to the assembled company of the Priests—of our most illustrious
Princes—and of all our Christian people; and then, in their presence, he repeated to them
all that he had before said to us; which, when they heard, they received him joyfully, and
earnestly entreated our peace-making and pious Sovereignty that an Ecumenical Council
might be assembled. To this their request, we gave our hearty consent; for, to speak the
truth, it is by the good will and under the direction of our God that we have assembled you
together. Wherefore as God, willing to establish his own counsel, hath for this purpose
brought you together from all parts of the world, behold the Gospels now lying before you,
and plainly crying aloud, “Judge justly;” stand firm as champions of religion, and be ready
with unsparing hand to cut away all innovations and new fangled inventions. And, as Peter
the Chief of the Apostolic College, struck the mad slave and cut off his Jewish ear with the
sword, so in like manner do ye wield the axe of the Spirit, and every tree which bears the
fruit of contention, of strife, or newly-imported innovation, either renew by transplanting
through the words of sound doctrine, or lay it low with canonical censure, and send it to
the fires of the future Gehenna, so that the peace of the Spirit may evermore protect the
whole body of the Church, compacted and united in one, and confirmed by the traditions
of the Fathers; and so may all our Roman State enjoy peace as well as the Church.</p>
<p>We have received letters from Hadrian, most Holy Pope of old Rome, by his Legates—
namely, Peter, the God-beloved Archpresbyter, and Peter, the God-beloved Presbyter
and Abbot—who will be present in council with you; and we command that, according to
synodical custom, these be read in the hearing of you all; and that, having heard these with
becoming silence, and moreover the Epistles contained in two octavos sent by the Chief
Priest and other Priests of the Eastern dioceses by John, most pious Monk and Chancellor
of the Patriarchal throne of Antioch, and Thomas, Priest and Abbot, who also are present
together with you, ye may by these understand what are the sentiments of the Church
Catholic on this point.</p>

<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 53.)</p>
<p><del>Certain bishops who had been led astray by the Iconoclasts came, asking to be received
back. The first of these was Basil of Ancyra.</del></p>
<p>The bishop Basil of Ancyra read as follows from a book; Inasmuch as ecclesiastical legislation
has canonically been handed down from past time, even from the beginning from
the holy Apostles, and from their successors, who were our holy fathers and teachers, and
also from the six holy and ecumenical synods, and from the local synods which were gathered
in the interests of orthodoxy, that those returning from any heresy whatever to the orthodox
faith and to the tradition of the Catholic Church, might deny their own heresy, and confess
the orthodox faith,</p>
<p>Wherefore I, Basil, bishop of the city of Ancyra, proposing to be united to the Catholic
Church, and to Hadrian the most holy Pope of Old Rome, and to Tarasius the most blessed
Patriarch, and to the most holy apostolic sees, to wit, Alexandria, Antioch, and the Holy
City, as well as to all orthodox high-priests and priests, make this written confession of my
faith, and I offer it to you as to those who have received power by apostolic authority. And
in this also I beg pardon from your divinely gathered holiness for my tardiness in this matter.
For it was not right that I should have fallen behind in the confession of orthodoxy, but it
arose from my entire lack of knowledge, and slothful and negligent mind in the matter.
Wherefore the rather I ask your blessedness to grant me indulgence in God’s sight.</p>
<p>I believe, therefore, and make my confession in one God, the Father Almighty, and in
one Lord Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, and in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of
Life. The Trinity, one in essence and one in majesty, must be worshipped and glorified in
one godhead, power, and authority. I confess all things pertaining to the incarnation of one
of the Holy Trinity, our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, as the Saints and the six Ecumenical
Synods have handed down. And I reject and anathematize every heretical babbling, as they
also have rejected them. I ask for the intercessions (πρεσβείας ) of our spotless Lady the
Holy Mother of God, and those of the holy and heavenly powers, and those of all the
Saints.518</p>
<note type="footnote">518 Thus far there was no expression of opinion from which the Iconoclasts would have dissented, for in all
that regarded the Blessed Virgin and the Saints and their invocation and patronage, the heretics agreed with the
orthodox. Protestants have been in the habit of treating the Iconoclasts as if they were substantially agreed with
them with regard to the cultus of the Blessed Virgin and of the other Saints. What an error this is, is easily
proved by citing two of the anathematisms of their Conciliabulum. “If anyone shall not confess that the Ever-</note>

in the humanity he assumed for our salvation; and of our spotless Lady, the holy Mother of

all the Saints—the sacred images of all these, I salute and venerate—rejecting and anathematizing
with my whole soul and mind the synod which was gathered together out of stubbornness
and madness, and which styled itself the Seventh Synod, but which by those who
think accurately was called lawfully and canonically a pseudo-synod, as being contrary to
all truth and piety, and audaciously and temerariously against the divinely handed down
ecclesiastical legislation, yea, even impiously having yelped at and scoffed at the holy and
venerable images, and having ordered these to be taken away out of the holy churches of
God; over which assembly presided Theodosius with the pseudonym of Ephesius, Sisinnius
of Perga, with the surname Pastillas, Basilius of Pisidia, falsely called “tricaccabus;” with
whom the wretched Constantine, the then Patriarch, was led (ἐματαιώθη) astray.</p>
<p>These things thus I confess and to these I assent, and therefore in simplicity of heart
and in uprightness of mind, in the presence of God, I have made the subjoined anathematisms.</p>
<p>Anathema to the calumniators of the Christians, that is to the image breakers.</p>
<p>Anathema to those who apply the words of Holy Scripture which were spoken against
idols, to the venerable images.</p>

<p>And if at any time by the fraud of the devil (which may God forbid!) I voluntarily or

thanks to God for this confession of yours, which you have made to the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The Holy Synod said: Glory to God which maketh one that which was severed.</p>
<p><del>Theodore, bishop of Myra, then read the same confession, and was received. The next
bishop who asked to be received read as follows: (col. 60)</del></p>
<p>Theodosius, the humble Christian, to the holy and Ecumenical Synod: I confess and I
agree to (συντίθεμαι) and I receive and I salute and I venerate in the first place the spotless
image of our Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, and the holy image of her who bore him
without seed, the holy Mother of God, and her help and protection and intercessions each
day and night as a sinner to my aid I call for, since she has confidence with Christ our God,
as he was born of her. Likewise also I receive and venerate the images of the holy and most
laudable Apostles, prophets, and martyrs and the fathers and cultivators of the desert. Not
indeed as gods (God forbid!) do I ask all these with my whole heart to pray for me to God,
that he may grant me through their intercessions to find mercy at his hands at the day of
judgment, for in this I am but showing forth more clearly the affection and love of my soul

<pb n="1053"/>
which I have borne them from the first. Likewise also I venerate and honour and salute the
reliques of the Saints as of those who fought for Christ and who have received grace from
him for the healing of diseases and the curing of sicknesses and the casting out of devils, as
the Christian Church has received from the holy Apostles and Fathers even down to us today.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am well pleased that there should be images in the churches of the faithful,
especially the image of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the holy Mother of God, of every kind
of material, both gold and silver and of every colour, so that his incarnation may be set forth
to all men. Likewise there may be painted the lives of the Saints and Prophets and Martyrs,
so that their struggles and agonies may be set forth in brief, for the stirring up and teaching
of the people, especially of the unlearned.</p>
<p>For if the people go forth with lights and incense to meet the “laurata” and images of
the Emperors when they are sent to cities or rural districts, they honour surely not the tablet
covered over with wax, but the Emperor himself. How much more is it necessary that in
the churches of Christ our God, the image of God our Saviour and of his spotless Mother
and of all the holy and blessed fathers and ascetics should be painted? Even as also St. Basil
says: “Writers and painters set forth the great deeds of war; the one by word, the other by
their pencils; and each stirs many to courage.” And again the same author “How much
pains have you ever taken that you might find one of the Saints who was willing to be your
importunate intercessor to the Lord?”519 And Chrysostom says, “The charity of the Saints
is not diminished by their death, nor does it come to an end with their exit from life, but
after their death they are still more powerful than when they were alive,” and many other
things without measure. Therefore I ask you, O ye Saints! I call out to you. I have sinned
against heaven and in your sight. Receive me as God received the luxurious man, and the
harlot, and the thief. Seek me out, as Christ sought out the sheep that was lost, which he
carried on his shoulders; so that there may be joy in the presence of God and of his angels
over my salvation and repentance, through your intervention, O all-holy lords! Let them
who do not venerate the holy and venerable images be anathema! Anathema to those who
blaspheme against the honourable and venerable images! To those who dare to attack and
blaspheme the venerable images and call them idols, anathema! To the calumniators of
Christianity, that is to say the Iconoclasts, anathema! To those who do not diligently teach
all the Christ-loving people to venerate and salute the venerable and sacred and honourable
images of all the Saints who pleased God in their several generations, anathema! To those
who have a doubtful mind and do not confess with their whole hearts that they venerate
the sacred images, anathema!</p>

<p>If you persevere in that orthodox Faith in which you have begun, and the sacred and
venerable images be by your means erected again in those parts, as by the lord, the Emperor
Constantine of pious memory, and the blessed Helen, who promulgated the orthodox Faith,
and exalted the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church your spiritual mother, and with
the other orthodox Emperors venerated it as the head of all Churches, so will your Clemency,
that is protected of God, receive the name of another Constantine, and another Helen,
through whom at the beginning the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church derived strength,
and like whom your own imperial fame is spread abroad by triumphs, so as to be brilliant
and deeply fixed in the whole world. But the more, if following the traditions of the orthodox
Faith, you embrace the judgment of the Church of blessed Peter, chief of the Apostles, and,
as of old your predecessors the holy Emperors acted, so you, too, venerating it with honour,
love with all your heart his Vicar, and if your sacred majesty follow by preference their orthodox
Faith, according to our holy Roman Church. May the chief of the Apostles himself,
to whom the power was given by our Lord God to bind and remit sins in heaven and earth,
be often your protector, and trample all barbarous nations under your feet, and everywhere
make you conquerors. For let sacred authority lay open the marks of his dignity, and how
great veneration ought to be shewn to his, the highest See, by all the faithful in the world.
For the Lord set him who bears the keys of the kingdom of heaven as chief over all, and by
Him is he honoured with this privilege, by which the keys of the kingdom of heaven are
entrusted to him. He, therefore, that was preferred with so exalted an honour was thought
worthy to confess that Faith on which the Church of Christ is founded. A blessed reward
followed that blessed confession, by the preaching of which the holy universal Church was
illumined, and from it the other Churches of God have derived the proofs of Faith. For the
blessed Peter himself, the chief of the Apostles, who first sat in the Apostolic See, left the
chiefship of his Apostolate, and pastoral care, to his successors, who are to sit in his most

<pb n="1056"/>
holy seat for ever. And that power of authority, which he received from the Lord God our
Saviour, he too bestowed and delivered by divine command to the Pontiffs, his successors,
etc.</p>
<p><del>As read in Greek to the Council.</del></p>
<p>(Migne, Pat. Lat., Tom. XCVI., col. 1218.)</p>
<p>If the ancient orthodoxy be perfected and restored by your means in those regions, and
the venerable icons be placed in their original state, you will be partakers with the Lord
Constantine, Emperor of old, now in the Divine keeping, and the Empress Helena, who
made conspicuous and confirmed the orthodox Faith, and exalted still more your holy
mother, the Catholic and Roman and spiritual Church, and with the orthodox Emperors
who ruled after them, and so your most pious and heaven-protected name likewise will be
set forth as that of another Constantine and another Helena, being renowned and praised
through the whole world, by whom the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church is restored.
And especially if you follow the tradition of the orthodox Faith of the Church of the holy
Peter and Paul, the chief Apostles, and embrace their Vicar, as the Emperors who reigned
before you of old both honoured their Vicar, and loved him with all their heart: and if your
sacred majesty honour the most holy Roman Church of the chief Apostles, to whom was
given power by God the Word himself to loose and to bind sins in heaven and earth. For
they will extend their shield over your power, and all barbarous nations shall be put under
your feet: and wherever you go they will make you conquerors. For the holy and chief
Apostles themselves, who set up the Catholic and orthodox Faith, have laid it down as a
written law that all who after them are to be successors of their seats, should hold their Faith
and remain in it to the end.</p>

<p>(Found in L. and C., Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 117.)</p>
<p>We greatly wondered that in your imperial commands, directed for the Patriarch of the
royal city, Tarasius, we find him there called Universal: but we know not whether this was
written through ignorance or schism, or the heresy of the wicked. But henceforth we advise
your most merciful and imperial majesty, that he be by no means called Universal in your
writings, because it appears to be contrary to the institutions of the holy Canons and the
decrees of the traditions of the holy Fathers. For he never could have ranked second, save
for the authority of our holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, as is plain to all.521 Because
<note type="footnote">521 This statement seems somewhat open to criticism in view of the position taken by St. Leo, and of the assertion
of Pope Gelasius that Constantinople was a suffragan see to Heraclea.</note>

<pb n="1057"/>
if he be named Universal, above the holy Roman Church which has a prior rank, which is
the head of all the Churches of God, it is certain that he shews himself as a rebel against the
holy Councils, and a heretic. For, if he is Universal, he is recognized to have the Primacy
even over the Church of our See, which appears ridiculous to all faithful Christians: because
in the whole world the chief rank and power was given to the blessed Apostle Peter by the
Redeemer of the world himself; and through the same Apostle, whose place we unworthily
hold, the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church holds the first rank, and the authority
of power, now and for ever, so that if any one, which we believe not, has called him, or assents
to his being called Universal, let him know that he is estranged from the orthodox Faith,
and a rebel against our holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.</p>
<p><del>After the reading was ended (col. 120)</del></p>
<p>Tarasius the most holy patriarch said: Did you yourselves receive these letters from the
most holy Pope, and did you carry them to our pious Emperor?</p>
<p>Peter and Peter the most beloved-of-God presbyters who held the place of Hadrian, the
most holy pope of Rome, said: We ourselves received such letters from our apostolic father
and delivered them to the pious lords.</p>
<p>John, the most magnificent Logothete, said: That this is the case is also known to the
Sicilians, the beloved of God Theodore, the bishop of Catanea, and the most revered deacon
Epiphanius who is with him, who holds the place of the archbishop of Sardinia. For both
of these at the bidding of our pious Emperors, went to Rome with the most reverend apocrisarius
of our most holy patriarch.</p>
<p>Theodore the God-beloved bishop of Catanea, standing in the midst, said: The pious
emperor, by his honourable jussio, bid send Leo, the most god-beloved presbyter (who together
with myself is a slave of your holiness), with the precious letter of his most sacred
majesty; and he who reveres our <del>sic in Greek, “your,” in Latin</del> holiness, being the governor
(στρατηγὸς ) of my province of Sicily, sent me to Rome with the pious jussio of our orthodox
Emperors.522</p>
<p>And when we were gone, we announced the orthodox faith of the pious emperors.</p>
<p>And when the most blessed Pope heard it, he said: Since this has come to pass in the
days of their reign, God has magnified their pious rule above all former reigns. And this
suggestion (ἀναφορὰν) which has been read he sent to our most pious kings together with
a letter to your holiness and with his vicars who are here present and presiding.</p>
<p>Cosmas, the deacon, notary, and chamberlain (Cubuclesius) said: And another letter
was sent by the most holy Pope of Old Rome to Tarasius, our most holy and oecumenical
Patriarch. Let it be disposed of as your holy assembly shall direct.</p>

<p>The Holy Synod said, Let it be read.</p>
<p><del>Then was read Hadrian’s letter to Tarasius of Constantinople, which ends by saying that,
“our dearly-loved proto-presbyter of the Holy Church of Rome, and Peter, a monk, a presbyter,
and an abbot, who have been sent by us to the most tranquil and pious emperors, we
beg you will deem them worthy of all kindness and humane amenity for the sake of St. Peter,
coropheus of the Apostles, and for our sakes, so that for this we may be able to offer you
our sincere thanks.”523 The letter being ended (col. 128),</del></p>
<p>Peter and Peter, the most reverend presbyters and representatives of the most holy Pope
of Old Rome said: Let the most holy Tarasius, Patriarch of the royal city, say whether he
agrees (στοιχεῖ) with the letters of the most holy Pope of Old Rome or not.</p>
<p>Tarasius the most holy patriarch said: The divine Apostle Paul, who was filled with the
light of Christ, and who hath begotten us through the gospel, in writing to the Romans,
commending their zeal for the true faith which they had in Christ our true God, thus said:
“Your faith is gone forth into all the world.” It is necessary to follow out this witness, and
he that would contradict it is without good sense. Wherefore Hadrian, the ruler of Old
Rome, since he was a sharer of these things, thus borne witness to, wrote expressly and truly
to our religious Emperors, and to our humility, confirming admirably and beautifully the
ancient tradition of the Catholic Church. And we also ourselves, having examined both in
writing,524 and by inquisition, and syllogistically and by demonstration, and having been
taught by the teachings of the Fathers, so have confessed, so do confess, and so will confess;
and shall be fast, and shall remain, and shall stand firm in the sense of the letters which have
just been read, receiving the imaged representations according to the ancient tradition of
our holy fathers; and these we venerate with firmly-attached525 affection, as made in the
<note type="footnote">523 Compare with this the statement of the famous historian, Gibbon (Chapter XLIX., N. 79), “The pope’s
legates were casual messengers, two priests without any special commission, and who were disavowed on their
return. Some vagabond monks were persuaded by the Catholics to represent the Oriental patriarchs. This
curious anecdote is revealed by Theodore Studites, one of the warmest Iconoclasts of the age.” And yet to this
tissue of false statements Bury, in his just-published edition of Gibbon (1898), has no note of correction to
make! And this has passed, and will pass, for history among the overwhelming majority of English readers!
Nor does there seem to be any possible excuse for Gibbon in either particular, the first statement is proved to
be false by the letters of Hadrian, the second statement is equally disproved by the letters of the “high priests of
the East,” in which it is quite clear that no claim was set up that they represented the Patriarchs, but the Patriarchates,
which they did, as they proved, in a very real sense. This letter Gibbon must have seen, if indeed he
ever took the trouble to read the Acts, for it is spread out in full in Actio Secunda and was read at length to the
Council.</note>

so that he wept.</p>
<p>Basil, the most holy bishop of Ancyra, said: Many times the father had read the story,

<p>John the most reverend monk and presbyter and representative of the Eastern high

<p>Theodore the most holy bishop of Catanea, said: If the holy Gregory, vigilant526 in divine

<p>Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch, said: But perhaps someone will say, Why do not the
images which we have work miracles? To which we answer, that as the Apostle has said,
signs are for those who do not believe, not for believers. For they who approached that
image were unbelievers. Therefore God gave them a sign through the image, to draw them
to our Christian faith. But “an evil and adulterous generation that seeketh after a sign and
no sign shall be given it.”</p>

<p>Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch said: There are certain affected with the sickness of
ignorance who are scandalized by these canons [viz. of the Trullan Synod] and say, And do
you really think they were adopted at the Sixth Synod? Now let all such know that the holy
great Sixth Synod was assembled at Constantinople concerning those who said that there
was but one energy and will in Christ. These anathematized the heretics, and having expounded
the orthodox faith, they went to their homes in the fourteenth year of Constantine.
But after four or five years the same527 fathers came together under Justinian, the son of
Constantine, and set forth the before-mentioned canons. And let no one doubt concerning
them. For they who subscribed under Constantine were the same as they who under
Justinian signed the present chart, as can manifestly be established from the unchangeable
similarity of their own handwriting. For it was right that they who had appeared at an
ecumenical synod should also set forth ecclesiastical canons. They said that we should be
led as (by the hand) by the venerable images to the recollection of the incarnation of Christ
and of his saving death, and if by them we are led to the realization of the incarnation of
Christ our God, what sort of an opinion shall we have of them who break down the venerable
images?</p>
<p><del>At the close of the Session, after a number of anathematisms had been pronounced, the
following was read, to which all the bishops subscribed (col. 317).</del></p>
<p>Fulfilling the divine precept of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, our holy Fathers did
not hide the light of the divine knowledge given by him to them under a bushel, but they
set it upon the candlestick of most useful teaching, so that it might give light to all in the
house—that is to say, to those who are born in the Catholic Church; lest perchance anyone
of those who piously confess the Lord might strike his foot against the stone of heretical evil
doctrine. For they expelled every error of heretics and they cut off the rotten member if it
was incurably sick. And with a fan they purged the floor. And the good wheat, that is to
say the word which nourisheth and which maketh strong the heart of man, they laid up in
the granary of the Catholic Church; but throwing outside the chaff of heretical evil opinion
they burned it with unquenchable fire. Therefore also this holy and ecumenical Synod, met
together for the second time in this illustrious metropolis of Nice, by the will of God and at
the bidding of our pious and most faithful Emperors, Irene a new Helena, and a new Constantine,
her God-protected offspring, having considered by their perusal the teachings of
our approved and blessed Fathers, hath glorified God himself, from whom there was given
to them wisdom for our instruction, and for the perfecting of the Catholic and Apostolic

Church: and against those who do not believe as they did, but have attempted to overshadow
the truth through their novelty, they have chanted the words of the psalm:528 “Oh how
much evil have thine enemies done in thy sanctuary; and have glorified themselves, saying,
There is not a teacher any more, and they shall not know that we treated with guile the word
of truth.” But we, in all things holding the doctrines and precepts of the same our Godbearing
Fathers, make proclamation with one mouth and one heart, neither adding anything,
nor taking anything away from those things which have been delivered to us by them. But
in these things we are strengthened, in these things we are confirmed. Thus we confess,
thus we teach, just as the holy and ecumenical six Synods have decreed and ratified. We
believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible; and in one
Lord Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son and Word, through whom all things were made,
and in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, consubstantial and coeternal with the same
Father and with his Son who hath had no beginning. The unbuilt-up, indivisible, incomprehensible,
and non-circumscribed Trinity; he, wholly and alone, is to be worshipped and
revered with adoration; one Godhead, one Lordship, one dominion, one realm and dynasty,
which without division is apportioned to the Persons, and is fitted to the essence severally.
For we confess that one of the same holy and consubstantial Trinity, our Lord Jesus Christ
the true God, in these last days was incarnate and made man for our salvation, and having
saved our race through his saving incarnation, and passion, and resurrection, and ascension
into heaven; and having delivered us from the error of idols; as also the prophet says, Not
an ambassador, not an angel, but the Lord himself hath saved us. Him we also follow, and
adopt his voice, and cry aloud; No Synod, no power of kings, no God-hated agreement hath
delivered the Church from the error of the idols, as the Jewdaizing conciliabulum hath madly
dreamed, which raved against the venerable images; but the Lord of glory himself, the incarnate
God, hath saved us and hath snatched us from idolatrous deceit. To him therefore
be glory, to him be thanks, to him be eucharists, to him be praise, to him be magnificence.
For his redemption and his salvation alone can perfectly save, and not that of other men
who come of the earth. For he himself hath fulfilled for us, upon whom the ends of the
earth are come through the economy of his incarnation, the words spoken beforehand by
his prophets, for he dwelt among us, and went in and out among us, and cast out the names
of idols from the earth, as it was written. But we salute the voices of the Lord and of his
Apostles through which we have been taught to honour in the first place her who is properly
and truly the Mother of God and exalted above all the heavenly powers; also the holy and
angelic powers; and the blessed and altogether lauded Apostles, and the glorious Prophets
and the triumphant Martyrs which fought for Christ, and the holy and God-bearing Doctors,
and all holy men; and to seek for their intercessions, as able to render us at home with the
<note type="footnote">528 The reference is to Ps. lxxiv. 3, but the text is quite different from ours.</note>

<pb n="1064"/>
all-royal God of all, so long as we keep his commandments, and strive to live virtuously.
Moreover we salute the image of the honourable and life-giving Cross, and the holy reliques
of the Saints; and we receive the holy and venerable images: and we salute them, and we
embrace them, according to the ancient traditions of the holy Catholic Church of God, that
is to say of our holy Fathers, who also received these things and established them in all the
most holy Churches of God, and in every place of his dominion. These honourable and
venerable images, as has been said, we honour and salute and reverently venerate: to wit,
the image of the incarnation of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, and that of our
spotless Lady the all-holy Mother of God, from whom he pleased to take flesh, and to save
and deliver us from all impious idolatry; also the images of the holy and incorporeal Angels,
who as men appeared to the just. Likewise also the figures and effigies of the divine and alllauded
Apostles, also of the God-speaking Prophets, and of the struggling Martyrs and of
holy men. So that through their representations we may be able to be led back in memory
and recollection to the prototype, and have a share in the holiness of some one of them.</p>
<p>Thus we have learned to think of these things, and we have been strengthened by our
holy Fathers, and we have been strengthened by their divinely handed down teaching. And
thanks be to God for his ineffable gift, that he hath not deserted us at the end nor hath the
rod of the ungodly come into the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put their hands, that
is to say their actual deeds,529 unto wickedness. But he doeth well unto those who are good
and true of heart, as the psalmist David melodiously has sung; with whom also we sing the
rest of the psalm: As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, the Lord shall lead
them forth with the evil doers; and peace shall be upon the Israel of God.</p>

<p>Leo the most renowned secretary said: The holy and blessed Synod know how at the

charges against the holy and spotless Church of the Christians for the setting up of the holy
images. But to-day we have in our hands the written blasphemy of those calumniators of
the Christians, that is to say, the absurd, and easily answered, and self-convicting definition
(ὅρον) of the pseudosyllogus, in all respects agreeing with the impious opinion of the Godhated

<head>Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum held in
Constantinople, A.D. 754.530</head>
<p>The Definition of the Holy, Great, and Ecumenical Seventh Synod.</p>
<p>The holy and Ecumenical synod, which by the grace of God and most pious command
of the God-beloved and orthodox Emperors, Constantine and Leo,531 now assembled in
the imperial residence city, in the temple of the holy and inviolate Mother of God and Virgin
Mary, surnamed in Blachernæ, have decreed as follows.</p>
<p>Satan misguided men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The
Mosaic law and the prophets cooperated to undo this ruin; but in order to save mankind
thoroughly, God sent his own Son, who turned us away from error and the worshipping of
idols, and taught us the worshipping of God in spirit and in truth. As messengers of his
saving doctrine, he left us his Apostles and disciples, and these adorned the Church, his
Bride, with his glorious doctrines. This ornament of the Church the holy Fathers and the
six Ecumenical Councils have preserved inviolate. But the before-mentioned demi-urgos
of wickedness could not endure the sight of this adornment, and gradually brought back
idolatry under the appearance of Christianity. As then Christ armed his Apostles against
the ancient idolatry with the power of the Holy Spirit, and sent them out into all the world,
so has he awakened against the new idolatry his servants our faithful Emperors, and endowed
them with the same wisdom of the Holy Spirit. Impelled by the Holy Spirit they could no
longer be witnesses of the Church being laid waste by the deception of demons, and
summoned the sanctified assembly of the God-beloved bishops, that they might institute
at a synod a scriptural examination into the deceitful colouring of the pictures (ὁμοιωμάτων)
which draws down the spirit of man from the lofty adoration (λατρείας) of God to the low
and material adoration (λατρείαν) of the creature, and that they, under divine guidance,
might express their view on the subject.</p>
<p>Our holy synod therefore assembled, and we, its 338 members, follow the older synodal
decrees, and accept and proclaim joyfully the dogmas handed down, principally those of
the six holy Ecumenical Synods. In the first place the holy and ecumenical great synod assembled
at Nice, etc.</p>
<p>After we had carefully examined their decrees under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
we found that the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental
doctrine of our salvation—namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy
synods. These condemned Nestorius because he divided the one Son and Word of God

into two sons, and on the other side, Arius, Dioscorus, Eutyches, and Severus, because they
maintained a mingling of the two natures of the one Christ.</p>
<p>Wherefore we thought it right, to shew forth with all accuracy, in our present definition
the error of such as make and venerate these, for it is the unanimous doctrine of all the holy
Fathers and of the six Ecumenical Synods, that no one may imagine any kind of separation
or mingling in opposition to the unsearchable, unspeakable, and incomprehensible union
of the two natures in the one hypostasis or person. What avails, then, the folly of the
painter, who from sinful love of gain depicts that which should not be depicted—that is,
with his polluted hands he tries to fashion that which should only be believed in the heart
and confessed with the mouth? He makes an image and calls it Christ. The name Christ
signifies God and man. Consequently it is an image of God and man, and consequently he
has in his foolish mind, in his representation of the created flesh, depicted the Godhead
which cannot be represented, and thus mingled what should not be mingled. Thus he is
guilty of a double blasphemy—the one in making an image of the Godhead, and the other
by mingling the Godhead and manhood. Those fall into the same blasphemy who venerate
the image, and the same woe rests upon both, because they err with Arius, Dioscorus, and
Eutyches, and with the heresy of the Acephali. When, however, they are blamed for undertaking
to depict the divine nature of Christ, which should not be depicted, they take refuge
in the excuse: We represent only the flesh of Christ which we have seen and handled. But
that is a Nestorian error. For it should be considered that that flesh was also the flesh of
God the Word, without any separation, perfectly assumed by the divine nature and made
wholly divine. How could it now be separated and represented apart? So is it with the human
soul of Christ which mediates between the Godhead of the Son and the dulness of the flesh.
As the human flesh is at the same time flesh of God the Word, so is the human soul also
soul of God the Word, and both at the same time, the soul being deified as well as the body,
and the Godhead remained undivided even in the separation of the soul from the body in
his voluntary passion. For where the soul of Christ is, there is also his Godhead; and where
the body of Christ is, there too is his Godhead. If then in his passion the divinity remained
inseparable from these, how do the fools venture to separate the flesh from the Godhead,
and represent it by itself as the image of a mere man? They fall into the abyss of impiety,
since they separate the flesh from the Godhead, ascribe to it a subsistence of its own, a personality
of its own, which they depict, and thus introduce a fourth person into the Trinity.
Moreover, they represent as not being made divine, that which has been made divine by
being assumed by the Godhead. Whoever, then, makes an image of Christ, either depicts
the Godhead which cannot be depicted, and mingles it with the manhood (like the Monophysites),
or he represents the body of Christ as not made divine and separate and as a person
apart, like the Nestorians.</p>

<pb n="1068"/>
<p>The only admissible figure of the humanity of Christ, however, is bread and wine in the
holy Supper. This and no other form, this and no other type, has he chosen to represent
his incarnation. Bread he ordered to be brought, but not a representation of the human
form, so that idolatry might not arise. And as the body of Christ is made divine, so also this
figure of the body of Christ, the bread, is made divine by the descent of the Holy Spirit; it
becomes the divine body of Christ by the mediation of the priest who, separating the oblation
from that which is common, sanctifies it.</p>
<p>The evil custom of assigning names to the images does not come down from Christ and
the Apostles and the holy Fathers; nor have these left behind them any prayer by which an
image should be hallowed or made anything else than ordinary matter.</p>
<p>If, however, some say, we might be right in regard to the images of Christ, on account
of the mysterious union of the two natures, but it is not right for us to forbid also the images
of the altogether spotless and ever-glorious Mother of God, of the prophets, apostles, and
martyrs, who were mere men and did not consist of two natures; we may reply, first of all:
If those fall away, there is no longer need of these. But we will also consider what may be
said against these in particular. Christianity has rejected the whole of heathenism, and so
not merely heathen sacrifices, but also the heathen worship of images. The Saints live on
eternally with God, although they have died. If anyone thinks to call them back again to
life by a dead art, discovered by the heathen, he makes himself guilty of blasphemy. Who
dares attempt with heathenish art to paint the Mother of God, who is exalted above all
heavens and the Saints? It is not permitted to Christians, who have the hope of the resurrection,
to imitate the customs of demon-worshippers, and to insult the Saints, who shine in
so great glory, by common dead matter.</p>
<p>Moreover, we can prove our view by Holy Scripture and the Fathers. In the former it
is said: “God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth;”
and: “Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in
heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath;” on which account God spoke to the Israelites
on the Mount, from the midst of the fire, but showed them no image. Further: “They
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man,…and
served the creature more than the Creator.” <del>Several other passages, even less to the point,
are cited.</del>532</p>
<p>The same is taught also by the holy Fathers. <del>The Synod appeals to a spurious passage
from Epiphanius and to one inserted into the writings of Theodotus of Ancyra, a friend of St.
Cyril’s; to utterances—in no way striking—of Gregory of Nazianzum, of SS. Chrysostom, Basil,
Athanasius of Amphilochius and of Eusebius Pamphili, from his Letter to the Empress Constantia,
who had asked him for a picture of Christ.</del>533</p>

<note type="footnote">533 These are Hefele’s words.</note>

<pb n="1069"/>
<p>Supported by the Holy Scriptures and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name
of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed out of the Christian
Church every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil
art of painters.</p>
<p>Whoever in future dares to make such a thing, or to venerate it, or set it up in a church,
or in a private house, or possesses it in secret, shall, if bishop, presbyter, or deacon, be deposed;
if monk or layman, be anathematised, and become liable to be tried by the secular
laws as an adversary of God and an enemy of the doctrines handed down by the Fathers.
At the same time we ordain that no incumbent of a church shall venture, under pretext of
destroying the error in regard to images, to lay his hands on the holy vessels in order to have
them altered, because they are adorned with figures. The same is provided in regard to the
vestments of churches, cloths, and all that is dedicated to divine service. If, however, the
incumbent of a church wishes to have such church vessels and vestments altered, he must
do this only with the assent of the holy Ecumenical patriarch and at the bidding of our pious
Emperors. So also no prince or secular official shall rob the churches, as some have done
in former times, under the pretext of destroying images. All this we ordain, believing that
we speak as doth the Apostle, for we also believe that we have the spirit of Christ; and as
our predecessors who believed the same thing spake what they had synodically defined, so
we believe and therefore do we speak, and set forth a definition of what has seemed good
to us following and in accordance with the definitions of our Fathers.</p>
<p>(1) If anyone shall not confess, according to the tradition of the Apostles and Fathers,

<head>Excursus on the Conciliabulum Styling Itself the Seventh Ecumenical
Council, But Commonly Called the Mock Synod of Constantinople.</head>
<p>a.d. 754.</p>
<p>The reader will find all the information he desires with regard to the great iconoclastic
controversy in the ordinary church-histories, and the theological side of the matter in the
writings of St. John Damascene. It seems, however, that in order to render the meaning of
the action of the last of the Ecumenical Councils clear it is necessary to provide an account
of the synod which was held to condemn what it so shortly afterward expressly approved.
I quote from Hefele in loco, and would only further draw the reader’s attention to the fact
that the main thing objected to was not (as is commonly supposed) the outward veneration
of the sacred icons, but the making and setting up of them, as architectural ornaments; and
that it was not only representations of the persons of the Most Holy Trinity, and of the Divine
Son in his incarnate form that were denounced, but even pictures of the Blessed Virgin and
of the other saints; all this is evident to anyone reading the foregoing abstract of the decree.</p>
<p>(Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol. V., p. 308 et seqq.)</p>
<p>The Emperor, after the death of the Patriarch Anastasius (a.d. 753), summoned the
bishops of his Empire to a great synod in the palace Hieria, which lay opposite to Constantinople
on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, between Chrysopolis and Chalcedon, a
little to the north of the latter. The vacancy of the patriarchate, facilitated his plans, since
the hope of succeeding to this see kept down, in the most ambitious and aspiring of the
bishops, any possible thought of opposition. The number of those present amounted to
338 bishops, and the place of president was occupied by Archbishop Theodosius of Ephesus,
already known to us as son of a former Emperor—Apsimar, from the beginning an assistant
in the iconoclastic movement. Nicephorus names him alone as president of the synod;
Theophanes, on the contrary, mentions Bishop Pastillas of Perga as second president, and
adds, “The Patriarchates of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem were not represented
<del>the last three were then in the hands of the Saracens</del>, the transactions began on February
10th, and lasted until August 8th (in Hieria); on the latter date, however, the synod assembled
in St. Mary’s Church in Blachernæ, the northern suburb of Constantinople, and the Emperor
now solemnly nominated Bishop Constantine of Sylæum, a monk, as patriarch of Constantinople.
On August 27th, the heretical decree <del>of the Synod</del> was published.”</p>
<p>We see from this that the last sessions of this Conciliabulum were held no longer in
Hieria, but in the Blachernæ of Constantinople. We have no complete Acts of this assembly,
but its very verbose ὅρος (decree), together with a short introduction, is preserved among
the acts of the Seventh Ecumenical Council.</p>

<pb n="1073"/>
<p>This decree was by no means suffered to remain inoperative.</p>
<p>(W. M. Sinclair. Smith and Wace, Dictionary of Chr. Biog., sub voce Constantinus VI.)</p>
<p>The Emperor singled out the more noted monks, and required them to comply with
the decrees of the synod. In a.d. 766 he exacted an oath against images from all the inhabitants
of the empire. The monks refused with violent obstinacy, and Copronymus appears
to have amused himself by treating them with ruthless harshness. The Emperor, indeed,
seems to have contemplated the extirpation of monachism. John the Damascene he persuaded
his bishops to excommunicate. Monks were forced to appear in the hippodrome at
Constantinople hand in hand with harlots, while the populace spat at them. The new patriarch
Constantinus, presented by the emperor to the council the last day of its session, was
forced to foreswear images, to attend banquets, to eat and drink freely against his monastic
vows, to wear garlands, to witness the coarse spectacles and hear the coarse language which
entertained the Emperor. Monasteries were destroyed, made into barracks, or secularized.
Lachanodraco, governor of the Thracian Theme, seems to have exceeded Copronymus in
his ribaldry and injustice. He collected a number of monks into a plain, clothed them with
white, presented them with wives, and forced them to choose between marriage and loss of
eyesight. He sold the property of the monasteries, and sent the price to the Emperor.
Copronymus publicly thanked him, and commended his example to other governors.</p>
<p>(Harnack. History of Dogma, Vol. V., p. 325 <del>Eng. Tr.</del>.)</p>
<p>The clergy obeyed when the decrees were published; but resistance was offered in the
ranks of the monks. Many took to flight, some became martyrs. The imperial police stormed
the churches, and destroyed those images and pictures that had not been secured. The
iconoclastic zeal by no means sprang from enthusiasm for divine service in spirit and in
truth. The Emperor now also directly attacked the monks; he meant to extirpate the hated
order, and to overthrow the throne of Peter. We see how the idea of an absolute military
state rose powerfully in Constantinople; how it strove to establish itself by brute force. The
Emperor, according to trustworthy evidence, made the inhabitants of the city swear that
they would henceforth worship no image, and give up all intercourse with monks. Cloisters
were turned into arsenals and barracks, relics were hurled into the sea, and the monks, as
far as possible, secularized. And the politically far-seeing Emperor, at the same time entered
into correspondence with France (Synod of Gentilly, a.d. 767), and sought to win Pepin.
History seemed to have suffered a violent rupture, a new era was dawning which should
supersede the history of the Church.</p>
<p>But the Church was too powerful, and the Emperor was not even master of Oriental
Christendom, but only of part of it. The orthodox Patriarchs of the East (under the rule of
Islam) declared against the iconoclastic movement, and a Church without monks or pictures,

<pb n="1074"/>
in schism with the other orthodox Churches, was a nonentity. A spiritual reformer was
wanting. Thus the great reaction set in after the death of the Emperor (a.d. 775), the ablest
ruler Constantinople had seen for a long time. This is not the place to describe how it was
inaugurated and cautiously carried out by the skilful policy of the Empress Irene; cautiously,
for a generation had already grown up that was accustomed to the cultus without images.
An important part was played by the miracles performed by the re-emerging relics and
pictures. But the lower classes had always been really favourable to them; only the army
and the not inconsiderable number of bishops who were of the school of Constantine had
to be carefully handled. Tarasius, the new Patriarch of Constantinople and a supporter of
images, succeeded, after overcoming much difficulty, and especially distrust in Rome and
the East, after also removing the excited army, in bringing together a General Council of
about 350 bishops at Nicæa, a.d. 787, which reversed the decrees of a.d. 754. The proceedings
of the seven sittings are of great value, because very important patristic passages have been
preserved in them which otherwise would have perished; for at this synod also the discussions
turned chiefly on the Fathers. The decision (ὅρος) restored orthodoxy and finally settled
it.</p>
<p>I cannot do better than to cite in conclusion the words of the profoundly learned
Archbishop of Dublin, himself a quasi-Iconoclast.</p>
<p>(Trench. Lect. Medieval Ch. Hist., p. 93.)</p>
<p>It is only fair to state that the most zealous favourers and promoters of this ill-directed
homage always disclaimed with indignation the charge of offering to the images any reverence
which did not differ in kind, and not merely in degree, from the worship which they offered
to Almighty God, designating it as they did by altogether a different name. We shall very
probably feel that in these distinctions which they drew between the one and the other,
between the “honour” which they gave to these icons and the “worship” which they withheld
from these and gave only to God, there lay no slightest justification of that in which they
allowed themselves; but these distinctions acquit them of idolatry, and it is the merest justice
to remember this.</p>
<p>(Trench. Ut supra, p. 99.)</p>
<p>I can close this Lecture with no better or wiser words than those with which Dean Milman
reads to us the lesson of this mournful story: “There was this irremediable weakness in the
cause of iconoclasm; it was a mere negative doctrine, a proscription of those sentiments
which had full possession of the popular mind, without any strong countervailing excitement.
The senses were robbed of their habitual and cherished objects of devotion, but there was
no awakening of an inner life of intense and passionate piety. The cold, naked walls from

<pb n="1075"/>
whence the Scriptural histories had been effaced, the despoiled shrines, the mutilated images,
could not compel the mind to a more pure and immaterial conception of God and the Saviour.
Hatred of images, in the process of the strife, might become, as it did, a fanaticism,
it could never become a religion. Iconoclasm might proscribe idolatry; but it had no power

<head>The Decree of the Holy, Great, Ecumenical Synod, the Second of Nice.</head>
<p>(Found in Labbe and Cossart, Concilia. Tom. VII., col. 552.)</p>
<p>The holy, great, and Ecumenical Synod which by the grace of God and the will of the
pious and Christ-loving Emperors, Constantine and Irene, his mother, was gathered together
for the second time at Nice, the illustrious metropolis of Bithynia, in the holy church of God
which is named Sophia, having followed the tradition of the Catholic Church, hath defined
as follows:</p>
<p>Christ our Lord, who hath bestowed upon us the light of the knowledge of himself, and
hath redeemed us from the darkness of idolatrous madness, having espoused to himself the
Holy Catholic Church without spot or defect, promised that he would so preserve her: and
gave his word to this effect to his holy disciples when he said: “Lo! I am with you always,
even unto the end of the world,” which promise he made, not only to them, but to us also
who should believe in his name through their word. But some, not considering of this gift,
and having become fickle through the temptation of the wily enemy, have fallen from the
right faith; for, withdrawing from the traditions of the Catholic Church, they have erred
from the truth and as the proverb saith: “The husbandmen have gone astray in their own
husbandry and have gathered in their hands nothingness,” because certain priests, priests
in name only, not in fact, had dared to speak against the God-approved ornament of the
sacred monuments, of whom God cries aloud through the prophet, “Many pastors have
corrupted my vineyard, they have polluted my portion.”</p>
<p>And, forsooth, following profane men, led astray by their carnal sense, they have calumniated
the Church of Christ our God, which he hath espoused to himself, and have failed
to distinguish between holy and profane, styling the images of our Lord and of his Saints
by the same name as the statues of diabolical idols. Seeing which things, our Lord God (not
willing to behold his people corrupted by such manner of plague) hath of his good pleasure
called us together, the chief of his priests, from every quarter, moved with a divine zeal and
brought hither by the will of our princes, Constantine and Irene, to the end that the traditions
of the Catholic Church may receive stability by our common decree. Therefore, with all
diligence, making a thorough examination and analysis, and following the trend of the truth,
we diminish nought, we add nought, but we preserve unchanged all things which pertain
to the Catholic Church, and following the Six Ecumenical Synods, especially that which met
in this illustrious metropolis of Nice, as also that which was afterwards gathered together
in the God-protected Royal City.</p>
<p>We believe<gap reason="omitted"/>life of the world to come. Amen.535</p>

<p>We detest and anathematize Arius and all the sharers of his absurd opinion; also
Macedonius and those who following him are well styled “Foes of the Spirit” (Pneumatomachi).
We confess that our Lady, St. Mary, is properly and truly the Mother of God, because
she was the Mother after the flesh of One Person of the Holy Trinity, to wit, Christ our God,
as the Council of Ephesus has already defined when it cast out of the Church the impious
Nestorius with his colleagues, because he taught that there were two Persons <del>in Christ</del>.
With the Fathers of this synod we confess that he who was incarnate of the immaculate
Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary has two natures, recognizing him as perfect God and
perfect man, as also the Council of Chalcedon hath promulgated, expelling from the divine
Atrium <del>αὐλῆς</del> as blasphemers, Eutyches and Dioscorus; and placing in the same category
Severus, Peter and a number of others, blaspheming in divers fashions. Moreover, with
these we anathematize the fables of Origen, Evagrius, and Didymus, in accordance with the
decision of the Fifth Council held at Constantinople. We affirm that in Christ there be two
wills and two operations according to the reality of each nature, as also the Sixth Synod,
held at Constantinople, taught, casting out Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Macarius,
and those who agree with them, and all those who are unwilling to be reverent.</p>
<p>To make our confession short, we keep unchanged all the ecclesiastical traditions handed
down to us, whether in writing or verbally, one of which is the making of pictorial representations,
agreeable to the history of the preaching of the Gospel, a tradition useful in many
respects, but especially in this, that so the incarnation of the Word of God is shown forth
as real and not merely phantastic, for these have mutual indications and without doubt have
also mutual significations.</p>
<p>We, therefore, following the royal pathway and the divinely inspired authority of our
Holy Fathers and the traditions of the Catholic Church (for, as we all know, the Holy Spirit
indwells her), define with all certitude and accuracy that just as the figure of the precious
and life-giving Cross, so also the venerable and holy images, as well in painting and mosaic
as of other fit materials, should be set forth in the holy churches of God, and on the sacred
vessels and on the vestments and on hangings and in pictures both in houses and by the
wayside, to wit, the figure of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, of our spotless Lady,
the Mother of God, of the honourable Angels, of all Saints and of all pious people. For by
so much more frequently as they are seen in artistic representation, by so much more
readily are men lifted up to the memory of their prototypes, and to a longing after them;
and to these should be given due salutation and honourable reverence (ἀσπασμὸν καὶ
<note type="footnote">scholar Gemistius Pletho remarked that if this were so, then the Latin theologians, like St. Thomas Aquinas
would long ago have appealed to the Synod. (Cf. Hefele, Hist. Councils, Vol. V., p. 374, Note 2.) This reasoning
is not conclusive if Cardinal Bellarmine is to be believed, who says that St. Thomas had never seen the Acts of
this synod. (De Imag. Sanct., Lib. ii., cap. xxii.)</note>

<pb n="1078"/>
τιμητικὴν προσκύνησιν), not indeed that true worship of faith (λατρείαν) which pertains
alone to the divine nature; but to these, as to the figure of the precious and life-giving Cross
and to the Book of the Gospels and to the other holy objects, incense and lights may be
offered according to ancient pious custom. For the honour which is paid to the image passes
on to that which the image represents, and he who reveres the image reveres in it the subject
represented. For thus the teaching of our holy Fathers, that is the tradition of the Catholic
Church, which from one end of the earth to the other hath received the Gospel, is
strengthened. Thus we follow Paul, who spake in Christ, and the whole divine Apostolic
company and the holy Fathers, holding fast the traditions which we have received. So we
sing prophetically the triumphal hymns of the Church, “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion;
Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Rejoice and be glad with all thy heart. The Lord hath taken
away from thee the oppression of thy adversaries; thou art redeemed from the hand of thine
enemies. The Lord is a King in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more, and peace
be unto thee forever.”</p>
<p>Those, therefore who dare to think or teach otherwise, or as wicked heretics to spurn
the traditions of the Church and to invent some novelty, or else to reject some of those
things which the Church hath received (e.g., the Book of the Gospels, or the image of the
cross, or the pictorial icons, or the holy reliques of a martyr), or evilly and sharply to devise
anything subversive of the lawful traditions of the Catholic Church or to turn to common
uses the sacred vessels or the venerable monasteries,536 if they be Bishops or Clerics, we
command that they be deposed; if religious or laics, that they be cut off from communion.</p>
<p><del>After all had signed, the acclamations began (col. 576).</del></p>
<p>The holy Synod cried out: So we all believe, we all are so minded, we all give our consent
and have signed. This is the faith of the Apostles, this is the faith of the orthodox, this is
the faith which hath made firm the whole world. Believing in one God, to be celebrated in
Trinity, we salute the honourable images! Those who do not so hold, let them be anathema.
Those who do not thus think, let them be driven far away from the Church. For we follow
the most ancient legislation of the Catholic Church. We keep the laws of the Fathers. We
anathematize those who add anything to or take anything away from the Catholic Church.
We anathematize the introduced novelty of the revilers of Christians. We salute the venerable
images. We place under anathema those who do not do this. Anathema to them who presume
to apply to the venerable images the things said in Holy Scripture about idols. Anathema
to those who do not salute the holy and venerable images. Anathema to those who
call the sacred images idols. Anathema to those who say that Christians resort to the sacred

<head>Excursus on the Present Teaching of the Latin and Greek Churches
on the Subject.</head>
<p>To set forth the present teaching of the Latin Church upon the subject of images and
the cultus which is due them, I cite the decree of the Council of Trent and a passage from
the Catechism set forth by the authority of the same synod.</p>
<p>(Conc. Trid., Sess. xxv. December 3d and 4th, 1563. <del>Buckley’s Trans.</del>)</p>
<p>The holy synod enjoins on all bishops, and others sustaining the office and charge of
teaching that, according to the usage of the Catholic and Apostolic Church received from
the primitive times of the Christian religion, and according to the consent of the holy
Fathers, and to the decrees of sacred councils, they especially instruct the faithful diligently
touching the intercession and invocation of saints; the honour paid to relics; and the lawful
use of images—teaching them, that the saints, who reign together with Christ, offer up their
own prayers to God for men; that it is good and useful suppliantly to invoke them, and to
resort to their prayers, aid and help, for obtaining benefits from God, through his Son, Jesus
Christ our Lord, who alone is our Redeemer and Saviour; but that they think impiously,
who deny that the saints, who enjoy eternal happiness in heaven, are to be invoked; or to
assert either that they do not pray for men; or, that the invocation of them to pray for each
of us, even in particular, is idolatry; or, that it is repugnant to the word of God, and is opposed
to the honour of the one mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus, or, that it is
foolish to supplicate, orally or inwardly, those who reign in heaven. Also, that the holy
bodies of holy martyrs and of others now living with Christ, which were the living members
of Christ, and the temples of the Holy Ghost, and which are by him to be raised unto eternal
life, and to be glorified, are to be venerated by the faithful, through which <del>bodies</del> many
benefits are bestowed by God on men; so that they who affirm that veneration and honour
are not due to the relics of saints; or, that these, and other sacred monuments, are uselessly
honoured by the faithful; and that the places dedicated to the memories of the Saints are
vainly visited for the purpose of obtaining their aid; are wholly to be condemned, as the
Church has already long since condemned, and doth now also condemn them.</p>
<p>Moreover, that the images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God and of the other Saints,
are to be had and retained particularly in temples, and that due honour and veneration are
to be awarded them; not that any divinity or virtue is believed to be in them, on account of
which they are to be worshipped; or that anything is to be asked of them; or that confidence
is to be reposed in images, as was of old done by Gentiles, who placed their hope in idols;
but because the honour which is shown unto them is referred to the prototypes which they
represent; in such wise that by the images which we kiss, and before which we uncover the

<pb n="1081"/>
head, and prostrate ourselves, we adore Christ, and venerate the Saints, whose similitude
they bear. And this, by the decrees of councils, and especially of the second synod of Nicæa,
has been ordained against the opponents of images.</p>
<p>And the bishops shall carefully teach this; that, by means of the histories of the mysteries
of our Redemption, depicted by paintings or other representations, the people are instructed,
and strengthened in remembering, and continually reflecting on the articles of faith; as also
that great profit is derived from all sacred images, not only because the people are thereby
admonished of the benefits and gifts which have been bestowed upon them by Christ, but
also because the miracles of God through the means of the Saints, and their salutary examples,
are set before the eyes of the faithful; that so, for those things they may give God thanks;
may order their own life and manners in imitation of the Saints; and may be excited to adore
and love God, and to cultivate piety. But if any one shall teach or think contrary to these
decrees, let him be anathema. And if any abuses have crept in amongst these holy and
salutary observances, the holy synod earnestly desires that they be utterly abolished; in such
wise that no images conducive to false doctrine, and furnishing occasion of dangerous error
to the uneducated, be set up. And if at times, when it shall be expedient for the unlearned
people, it happen that the histories and narratives of Holy Scripture are pourtrayed and
represented; the people shall be taught, that not thereby is the Divinity represented, as
though it could be perceived by the eyes of the body, or be depictured by colours or figures.
Moreover, in the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics, and the sacred use of images,
every superstition shall be removed, all filthy lucre be abolished, finally, all lasciviousness
be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a wantonness of
beauty: nor shall men also pervert the celebration of the saints, and the visitation of relics,
into revellings and drunkenness; as if festivals are celebrated to the honour of the saints by
luxury and wantonness. Finally, let so great care and diligence be used by bishops touching
these matters, as that there appear nothing disorderly, or unbecomingly or confusedly arranged,
nothing profane, nothing indecorous; since holiness becometh the house of God.</p>
<p>And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy synod ordains, that
it be lawful for no one to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image in any place, or
church, howsoever exempted, except it shall have been approved of by the bishop: also, that
no new miracles are to be admitted, or new relics received, unless the said bishop has taken
cognizance and approved thereof; who, as soon as he has obtained some certain information
in regard of these matters shall, after having taken advice with theologians, and other pious
men, act therein as he shall judge to be agreeable to truth and piety. But if any doubtful, or
difficult abuse is to be extirpated, or, in fine, if any more serious question shall arise touching
these matters, the bishop, before he decides the controversy, shall await the sentence of the
metropolitan and of the bishops of the same province, in a provincial council; yet so, that

<pb n="1082"/>
nothing new, or that has not previously been usual in the Church, shall be decreed, without
the most holy Roman Pontiff having been first consulted.</p>
<p>(Catechism of the Council of Trent.537 Pt. IV., Chap. VI. <del>Buckley’s Trans.</del>)</p>
<p>Question III.</p>
<p>God and the Saints addressed differently.</p>
<p>From God and from the Saints we implore assistance not after the same manner: for
we implore God to grant us the blessing which we want, or to deliver us from evils; but the
Saints, because favourites with God, we solicit to undertake our advocacy with God, to obtain
of him for us those things of which we stand in need. Hence we employ two different forms
of prayer: for to God, we properly say, Have mercy on us, hear us; to the saints, Pray for us.</p>
<p>Question IV.</p>
<p>In what Manner we may beseech the Saints to have mercy on us.</p>
<p>We may, however, also ask the saints themselves to have mercy on us, for they are most
merciful; but we do so on a different principle, for we may beseech them that, touched with
the misery of our condition, they would interpose, in our behalf, their favour and intercession
with God. In the performance of this duty, it is most strictly incumbent on all, to beware
lest they transfer to any creature the right which belongs exclusively to the Deity; and when
we repeat before the image of any Saint the Lord’s Prayer, our idea must then be to beg of
the Saint to pray with us, and ask for us those favours that are contained in the form of the
Lord’s Prayer, to become, in fine, our interpreter and intercessor with God; for that this is
an office which the saints discharge, St. John the apostle has taught in the Revelation.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Eastern Church may be seen from the following from The Orthodox
Confession of the faith of the Catholic and Apostolic Church of the East.</p>
<p>(Confes. Orthodox. P. III. Q. LII. <del>apud Kimmel, Libri Symbolici Ecclesiæ Orientalis538</del>.)</p>
<note type="footnote">537 The reader will remember that while of great weight the Catechism was not set forth by the Council, nor
are its statements de fide in the Latin Church.</note>
<note type="footnote">538 This is not found in Schaff’s, The Creeds of Christendom, Vol. II., although part of the Orthodox Concession
(viz. Pt. I.) is reprinted. The editor explains (p. 275) that he has printed “the doctrinal part in full,” and has
omitted the rest because it “belongs to Ethics rather than Symbolics.” A somewhat extraordinary opinion to be
held by anyone who has read the omitted parts.</note>

<pb n="1083"/>
<p>Rightly therefore do we honour the Saints of God, as it is written (Ps. cxxxix. 17) “How
dear are thy friends unto me, O God.” And divine assistance we ask for through them, just
as God ordered the friends of Job to go to his faithful servant, and that he should offer sacrifice
and pray for them that they might obtain remission of sin through their patronage.
And in the second place this [First] commandment forbids men to adore any creature with
the veneration of adoration (λατρείας). For we do not honour the Saints as though adoring
them, but we call upon them as our brothers, and as friends of God, and therefore we seek
the divine assistance through these, our brethren. For they go between the Lord and us for
our advantage. And this in no respect is opposed to this commandment of the decalogue.</p>
<p>Wherefore just as the Israelites did not sin when they called upon Moses to mediate
between them and God, so neither do we sin, when we call for the aid and intercession of
the Saints.</p>
<p>(Ibid. Quæstio LIV.)</p>
<p>This <del>Second</del> Commandment is separate from the first. For that treated of the Unity
of the true God, forbidding and taking away the multitude of gods. But the present treats
of external religious ceremonies. For besides the not honouring of false gods, we ought to
dedicate no carved likeness in their honour, nor to venerate with adoration such things, nor
to offer the sacrifices of adoration to them. Therefore they sin against this commandment
who venerate idols as gods, and offer sacrifices to them, and place their whole confidence
and hope in them; as also the Psalmist says (Ps. cxxxv. 15), “The images of the heathen are
silver and gold, etc.” They also transgress this precept who are given up to covetousness,
etc.</p>
<p>(Ibid. Quæstio LV.)</p>
<p>There is a great distinction between idols and images (τῶν εἰδώλων καὶ τῶν εἰκόνων).</p>
<p>For idols are the figments and inventions of men, as the Apostle testifies when he says (1
Cor. viii. 4), “We know that an idol is nothing in the world.” But an image is a representation
of a true thing having a real existence in the world. Thus, for example, the image of our
Saviour Jesus Christ and of the holy Virgin Mary, and of all the Saints. Moreover, the Pagans
venerated their idols as gods, and offered to them sacrifices, esteeming the gold and silver
to be God, as did Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p>But when we honour and venerate the images, we in no way venerate the colours or the
wood of which they are made; but we glorify with the veneration of dulia (δουλείας), those
holy beings of which these are the images, making them by this means present to our minds

<pb n="1084"/>
as if we could see them with our eyes. For this reason we venerate the image of the crucifixion,
and place before our minds Christ hung upon the cross for our salvation, and to such
like we bow the head, and bend the knee with thanksgiving. Likewise we venerate the image
of the Virgin Mary, we lift up our mind to her the most holy Mother of God, bowing both
head and knees before her; calling her blessed above all men and women, with the Archangel
Gabriel. The veneration, moreover, of the holy images as received in the orthodox Church,
in no respect transgresses this commandment.</p>
<p>But this is not one and the same with that we offer to God; nor do the orthodox give it
to the art of the painting, but to those very Saints whom the images represent. The Cherubim
which overshadowed the mercy-seat, representing the true Cherubim which stand before
God in heaven, the Israelites revered and honoured without any violation of the commandment
of God, and likewise the children of Israel revered the tabernacle of witness with a
suitable honour (II Sam. vi. 13), and yet in no respect sinned nor set at naught this precept,
but rather the more glorified God. From these considerations it is evident that when we
honour the holy images, we do not transgress the commandment of the decalogue, but we
most especially praise God, who is “to be admired in his Saints” (Ps. lxviii. 35). But this
only we should be careful of, that every image has a label, telling of what Saint it is, that thus
the intention of him who venerates it may be the more easily fulfilled.</p>
<p>And for the greater establishment of the veneration of the holy images, the Church of
God at the Seventh Ecumenical Synod anathematized all those who made war against the
images, and set forth the veneration of the august images, and established it forever, as is
evident from the ninth canon of that synod.</p>
<p>(Ibid. Quæstio LVI.)</p>
<p>Why was he praised in the Old Testament who broke down the brazen serpent (II Kgs.
xviii. 4) which long before Moses had set up on high? Answer: Because the Jews were beginning
an apostasy from the veneration of the true God, venerating that serpent as the true
God; and offering to it incense as the Scripture saith. Therefore wishing to cut off this evil,
lest it might spread further, he broke up that serpent in order that the Israelites might have
no longer that incentive to idolatry. But before they honoured the serpent with the veneration
of adoration, no one was condemned in that respect nor was the serpent broken.</p>
<p>But Christians in no respect honour images as gods, neither in their veneration do they
take anything from the true adoration due to God. Nay, rather they are led by the hand, as
it were, by the image to God, while under their visible representations they honour the Saints
with the veneration of dulia (δουλικῶς) as the friends of God; asking for their mediation
(μεσιτεύουσιν) to the Lord. And if perchance some have strayed, from their lack of knowledge,
in their veneration, it were better to teach such an one, rather than that the veneration
of the august images should be banished from the Church.</p>

<head>The Canons of the Holy and Ecumenical Seventh Council.539</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<head>Canon I.</head>
<p>That the sacred Canons are in all things to be observed.</p>
<p>The pattern for those who have received the sacerdotal dignity is found in the testimonies
and instructions laid down in the canonical constitutions, which we receiving with a glad
mind, sing unto the Lord God in the words of the God-inspired David, saying: “I have had
as great delight in the way of thy testimonies as in all manner of riches.” “Thou hast commanded
righteousness as thy testimonies for ever.” “Grant me understanding and I shall
live.” Now if the word of prophesy bids us keep the testimonies of God forever and to live
by them, it is evident that they must abide unshaken and without change. Therefore Moses,
the prophet of God, speaketh after this manner: “To them nothing is to be added, and from
them nothing is to be taken away.” And the divine Apostle glorying in them cries out,
“which things the angels desire to look into,” and, “if an angel preach to you anything besides
that which ye have received, let him be anathema.” Seeing these things are so, being thus
well-testified unto us, we rejoice over them as he that hath found great spoil, and press to
our bosom with gladness the divine canons, holding fast all the precepts of the same, complete
and without change, whether they have been set forth by the holy trumpets of the Spirit,
the renowned Apostles, or by the Six Ecumenical Councils, or by Councils locally assembled
for promulgating the decrees of the said Ecumenical Councils, or by our holy Fathers. For
all these, being illumined by the same Spirit, defined such things as were expedient. Accordingly
those whom they placed under anathema, we likewise anathematize; those whom they
deposed, we also depose; those whom they excommunicated, we also excommunicate; and
those whom they delivered over to punishment, we subject to the same penalty. And now
“let your conversation be without covetousness,” crieth out Paul the divine Apostle, who
was caught up into the third heaven and heard unspeakable words.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</p>
<p>We gladly embrace the Divine Canons, viz.: those of the Holy Apostles, of the Six Ecumenical
Synods, as also of the local synods and of our Holy Fathers, as inspired by one and the
same Holy Spirit. Whom they anathematize we also anathematize; whom they depose, we
depose; whom they cut off, we cut off; and whom they subject to penalties, we also so subject.</p>

<pb n="1086"/>
<p>(Hist. of Dogma <del>Eng. Trans.</del>, Vol. V., p. 327).</p>
<p>Just as at Trent, in addition to the restoration of mediæval doctrine, a series of reforming
decrees was published, so this Synod promulgated twenty-two canons which can be similarly
described. The attack on monachism and the constitution of the Church had been of some
use. They are the best canons drawn up by an Ecumenical Synod. The bishops were enjoined
to study, to live simply, and be unselfish, and to attend to the cure of souls; the monks to
observe order, decorum, and also to be unselfish. With the State and the Emperor no
compromise was made; on the contrary, the demands of Maximus Confessor and John of
Damascus are heard, though in muffled tones, from the canons.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>From the wording of this canon it is clearly seen that by the Fathers of this Council the
canons commonly called “Apostolical” are attributed to the Apostles themselves as to their
true authors, conformably to the Trullan Synod540 and to the opinion then prevalent among
the Greeks.</p>
<p>For since the Fathers were well persuaded that the discipline and doctrine contained in
these canons could be received and confirmed, they cared but little to enquire anxiously
who were their true authors, being content in this question to follow and embrace the then
commonly received opinion, and to ascribe these canons to them, just as, the other day, the
Tridentine Synod (Sess. XXV., cap. j., De Reform) calls these, without any explanation, the
“Canons of the Apostles,” because then as now they were commonly called by that name.</p>
<p>Beveridge.</p>
<p>(Annotat., p. 166, at end of Vol. II.).</p>
<p>Here are recognized and confirmed the canons set forth by the Six Ecumenical Councils.
And although all agree that the fifth and sixth Synods adopted no canons, unless that those
of the Council in Trullo be attributed to them, yet when Tarasius the Patriarch of Constantinople
claimed Canon 82 of the Trullan Canons as having been set forth by the sixth
synod (as is evident from the annotations on that canon), all the canons of Trullo seem to
be confirmed as having issued from the Sixth Synod. Or else, perchance, as is supposed by
Balsamon and Zonaras, as also by this present synod, the Trullan was held to be Quinisext
(πενθέκτη), and the canons decreed by it to belong to both the fifth and the sixth council.
Otherwise I do not see what meaning these words <del>“of the Six Ecumenical Synods”</del> can
have, for it will be remembered that the reference is to the ecclesiastical canons of the Six
Ecumenical Synods, and not to their dogmatic decrees.</p>

<head>Canon II.</head>
<p>That he who is to be ordained a Bishop must be steadfastly resolved to observe the canons,
otherwise he shall not be ordained.</p>
<p>When we recite the psalter, we promise God: “I will meditate upon thy statutes, and
will not forget thy words.” It is a salutary thing for all Christians to observe this, but it is
especially incumbent upon those who have received the sacerdotal dignity. Therefore we
decree, that every one who is raised to the rank of the episcopate shall know the psalter by
heart, so that from it he may admonish and instruct all the clergy who are subject to him.
And diligent examination shall be made by the metropolitan whether he be zealously inclined
to read diligently, and not merely now and then, the sacred canons, the holy Gospel, and
the book of the divine Apostle, and all other divine Scripture; and whether he lives according
to God’s commandments, and also teaches the same to his people. For the special treasure
(οὐσία) of our high priesthood is the oracles which have been divinely delivered to us, that
is the true science of the Divine Scriptures, as says Dionysius the Great. And if his mind be
not set, and even glad, so to do and teach, let him not be ordained. For says God by the
prophet, “Thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest
to me.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</p>
<p>Whoever is to be a bishop must know the Psalter by heart: he must thoroughly understand
what he reads, and not merely superficially, but with diligent care, that is to say the Sacred
Canons, the Holy Gospel, the book of the Apostle, and the whole of the Divine Scripture. And
should he not have such knowledge, he is not to be ordained.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>Whoso is to be elevated to the grade of the episcopate should know…the book of the
Apostle Paul, and the whole divine scripture and search out its meaning and understand
the things that are written. For the very foundation and essence of the high priesthood is
the true knowledge of holy Scripture, according to Dionysius the Great. And if he has this
knowledge let him be ordained, but if not, not. For God hath said by the prophet: “Thou
hast put away from thee knowledge, therefore I have also put thee away from me, that thou
mayest not be my priest.”</p>

<p>The persecution of the Iconoclasts had driven all the best Christians into hiding, or into
far distant exile; this had made them rustic, and had taken from them their taste for study.
The council therefore is forced to be content with a knowledge of only what is absolutely
necessary, provided it was united with a willingness to learn. The examination with which
the ceremony of the ordination of bishops begins seems to be a remains of this discipline.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>The Synod teaches in this canon that “all Christians” will find it most profitable to
meditate upon God’s justifyings and to keep his words in remembrance, and especially is
this the case with bishops.</p>
<p>And it should be noted that formerly not only the clergy, but also the lay people, learned
the Psalms, that is the whole Psalter, by heart, and made a most sweet sound by chanting
them while about their work.</p>
<p>But as time went on, little by little this pious custom of reciting the Psalter and of imposing
its recitation and a meditation thereon at certain intervals, slipped away to the clergy
only and to monks and nuns, as to those specially consecrated to the service of God and to
meditation upon the divine words, as Lupus points out. And from this discipline and
practice the appointment of the Ecclesiastical or Canonical Office had its rise, which imposes
the necessity of reciting the Psalms at certain intervals of time.</p>

<p>That it does not pertain to princes to choose a Bishop.</p>
<p>Let every election of a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, made by princes stand null, according
to the canon which says: If any bishop making use of the secular powers shall by their means
obtain jurisdiction over any church, he shall be deposed, and also excommunicated, together
with all who remain in communion with him. For he who is raised to the episcopate must
be chosen by bishops, as was decreed by the holy fathers of Nice in the canon which says:
It is most fitting that a bishop be ordained by all the bishops in the province; but if this is
difficult to arrange, either on account of urgent necessity, or because of the length of the
journey, three bishops at least having met together and given their votes, those also who are
absent having signified their assent by letters, the ordination shall take place. The confirmation
of what is thus done, shall in each province be given by the metropolitan thereof.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</p>
<p>Every election made by a secular magistrate is null.</p>
<p>This is a canon of a synod recognized by East and West as ecumenical! The reader can
hardly resist the reflection that in this case there have been and are a great many intruding
clergymen in the world, whose appointment to their several offices is “null.” Van Espen,
however, suggests an ingenious way out of the difficulty, which is followed with great approval
by Hefele.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Canon xxix. of those commonly called Apostolic, and canon iv. of Nice are renewed in
this canon.</p>
<p>From the words of this canon it is sufficiently clear that in this canon the synod is
treating of the choice and intrusion of persons into ecclesiastical offices which the magistrates
and Princes had arrogated to themselves under the title of Domination (Dominatio); and
by no means of that choice or rather nomination which Catholic princes and kings have
everywhere and always used.</p>

<head>Canon IV.</head>
<p>That Bishops are to abstain from all receiving of gifts.</p>
<p>The Church’s herald, Paul the divine Apostle, laying down a rule (κανόνα) not only for
the presbyters of Ephesus but for the whole company of the priesthood, speaks thus explicitly,
saying, “I have coveted no man’s silver or gold, or apparel. I have shewed you all things,
how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak;” for he accounted it more blessed to
give. Therefore we being taught by him do decree, that under no circumstances, shall a
Bishop for the sake of filthy lucre invent feigned excuses for sins, and exact gold or silver
or other gifts from the bishops, clergy, or monks who are subject to him. For says the
Apostle, “The unrighteous shall not possess the kingdom of God,” and, “The children ought
not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.” If then any is found, who
for the sake of exacting gold or any other gift, or who from personal feeling, has suspended
from the ministry, or even excommunicated, any of the clergy subject to his jurisdiction, or
who has closed any of the venerable temples, so that the service of God may not be celebrated
in it, pouring out his madness even upon things insensible, and thus shewing himself to be
without understanding, he shall be subjected to the same punishment he devised for others,
and his trouble shall return on his own head, as a transgressor of God’s commandment and
of the apostolic precepts. For Peter the supreme head (ἡ κερυφαία ἀκρότης) of the Apostles
commands, “Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not
by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind; neither as being lords
over the clergy (τῶν κλήρων [A.V. God’s heritage]); but being ensamples to the flock. And
when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</p>
<p>We decree that no bishop shall extort gold or silver, or anything else from bishops, clerics,
or monks subject to his jurisdiction. And if anyone through the power of gold or of any other
thing or through his own whims, shall be found to have prevented any one of the clergy who
are subject to him, from the celebration of the holy offices, or shall have shut up a venerable
temple so that the sacred worship of God could not be performed in it, he shall be subject to
the lex talionis. For Peter the Apostle says: Feed the flock of God, not of necessity but willingly,
and according to God; not for filthy lucre’s sake, but with a prompt mind; not exercising
lordship over the clergy, but being an example to the flock.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>

<pb n="1091"/>
<p>Note the present canon, which punishes those bishops by the lex talionis, who for filthy
lucre’s sake, or out of private affection, separate any from themselves, or close temples.
Wherefore he who cuts off others thus, let him be cut off. But he who shuts off a temple
shall be punished even more than by cutting off. But lest any one should say, by the argument
á contrario, that a bishop should not be punished who neither for the sake of filthy lucre
nor out of private spite, but lawfully cuts some off, or closes temples, I answer that this argument
only holds good of the cutting off. For a bishop who for any reason, whether just
or unjust, shuts up a temple, should be punished, so it seems to me, as I have said above.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>It would seem that at that time among the Greeks the use of local interdict (interdicti
localis) was not known. But very many theologians wish to find a vestige of this interdict
in the IVth century, in St. Basil’s epistle cclxx. (otherwise ccxliv.), where the holy doctor
teaches that the person who carries off by force a virgin, and those who are cognizant of this
wickedness ought to be smitten with excommunication, and that the village or its inhabitants,
to which the ravisher shall escape and where he shall be kept in safety, shall be shut out from
the prayers.</p>
<p>This canon, or rather the first part of it, is found in the Corpus Juris Canonici, Gratian’s

<head>Canon V.</head>
<p>That they who cast contumely upon clerics because they have been ordained in the church
without bringing a gift with them, are to be published with a fine.</p>
<p>It is a sin unto death when men incorrigibly continue in their sin, but they sin more
deeply, who proudly lifting themselves up oppose piety and sincerity, accounting mammon
of more worth than obedience to God, and caring nothing for his canonical precepts. The
Lord God is not found among such, unless, perchance, having been humbled by their own
fall, they return to a sober mind. It behoves them the rather to turn to God with a contrite
heart and to pray for forgiveness and pardon of so grave a sin, and no longer to boast in an
unholy gift. For the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart. With regard,
therefore, to those who pride themselves that because of their benefactions of gold they were
ordained in the Church, and resting confidently in this evil custom (so alien from God and
inconsistent with the whole priesthood), with a proud look and open mouth vilify with abusive
words those who on account of the strictness of their life were chosen by the Holy
Ghost and have been ordained without any gift of money, we decree in the first place that
they take the lowest place in their order; but if they do not amend let them be subjected to
a fine. But if it appear that any one has done this <del>i.e., given money</del>, at any time as a price
for ordination, let him be dealt with according to the Apostolic Canon which says: “If a
bishop has obtained possession of his dignity by means of money (the same rule applies
also to a presbyter or deacon) let him be deposed and also the one who ordained him, and
let him also be altogether cut off from communion, even as Simon Magus was by me Peter.”
To the same effect is the second canon of our holy fathers of Chalcedon, which says: If any
bishop gives ordination in return for money, and puts up for sale that which cannot be sold,
and ordains for money a bishop or chorepiscopus, or presbyter, or deacon, or any other of
those who are reckoned among the clergy; or who for money shall appoint anyone to the
office of oeconomus, advocate, or paramonarius; or, in a word, who hath done anything else
contrary to the canon, for the sake of filthy lucre—he who hath undertaken to do anything
of this sort, having been convicted, shall be in danger of losing his degree. And he who has
been ordained shall derive no advantage from the ordination or promotion thus negotiated;
but let him remain a stranger to the dignity and responsibility which he attained by means
of money. And if any one shall appear to have acted as a go-between in so shameful and
godless a traffic, he also, if he be a cleric, shall be removed from his degree; if he be a layman
or a monk, let him be excommunicated.</p>

<pb n="1093"/>
<p>It seems that such as glory in the fact that they owe their position to their liberality in gold
to the Church, and who contemn those who were chosen because of their virtue and were appointed
without any largess, should receive the lowest place in their order. And should they
continue in their ways, let them be punished. But those who made such gifts so as to get ordinations,
let such be cast forth from communion, as Simon Magus was by Peter.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Zonaras and Balsamon in earlier times, and later Christian Lupus and Van Espen, remarked
that the second part of this canon treats of simony, but not the first. This has in
view rather those who, on account of their large expenditure on churches and the poor,
have been raised, without simony, to the clerical estate as a reward and recognition of their
beneficence; and being proud of this, now depreciate other clergymen who were unable or
unwilling to make such foundations and the like.</p>

<head>Canon VI.</head>
<p>Concerning the holding of a local Synod at the time appointed.</p>
<p>Since there is a canon which says, twice a year in each province, the canonical enquiries
shall be made in the gatherings of the bishops; but because of the inconveniences which
those who thus came together had to undergo in travelling, the holy fathers of the Sixth
Council decreed that once each year, without regard to place or excuse which might be
urged, a council should be held and the things which are amiss corrected. This canon we
now renew. And if any prince be found hindering this being carried out, let him be excom-
municated. But if any of the metropolitans shall take no care that this be done, he being
free from constraint or fear or other reasonable excuse, let him be subjected to the canonical
penalties. While the council is engaged in considering the canons or matters which have
regard to the Gospel, it behoves the assembled Bishops, with all attention and grave thought
to guard the divine and life-giving commandments of God, for in keeping of them there is
great reward; because our lamp is the commandment, and our light is the law, and trial and
discipline are the way of life, and the commandment of the Lord shining afar giveth light
to the eyes. It is not permitted to a metropolitan to demand any of those things which the
bishops bring with them, whether it be a horse or any other gift. If he be convicted of doing
anything of this sort, he shall restore fourfold.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</p>
<p>Whenever it is not possible for a synod to meet according to the decree formulated long
ago, twice in each year, at least let it be held once, as seemed good to the Sixth Synod. Should
any magistrate forbid such meeting, let him be cast out: and a bishop who shall take no pains
to assemble it, shall be subject to punishment. And when the synod is held, should it appear
that the Metropolitan has taken anything away from any bishop, let him restore four-fold.</p>
<p>Hefele.</p>
<p>Anastasius remarks on this, that this ordinance (whether the whole canon or only its
last passage must remain undecided) was not accepted by the Latins. That this canon did
not forbid the so-called Synodicum, which the metropolitans had lawfully to receive from
the bishops, and the bishops from the priests, is remarked by Van Espen, l. c. p. 464.</p>

<head>Canon VII.</head>
<p>That to churches consecrated without any deposit of the reliques of the Saints, the defect should
be made good.</p>
<p>Paul the divine Apostle says: “The sins of some are open beforehand, and some they
follow after.” These are their primary sins, and other sins follow these. Accordingly upon
the heels of the heresy of the traducers of the Christians, there followed close other ungodliness.
For as they took out of the churches the presence of the venerable images, so likewise
they cast aside other customs which we must now revive and maintain in accordance with
the written and unwritten law. We decree therefore that relics shall be placed with the accustomed
service in as many of the sacred temples as have been consecrated without the
relics of the Martyrs. And if any bishop from this time forward is found consecrating a
temple without holy relics, he shall be deposed, as a transgressor of the ecclesiastical traditions.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</p>
<p>Let reliques of the Holy Martyrs be placed in such churches as have been consecrated
without them, and this with the accustomed prayers. But whoever shall consecrate a church
without these shall be deposed as a transgressor of the traditions of the Church.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>But someone may be surprised that oratories to-day are consecrated without any deposition
of reliques. And they may ask why the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated in them by
bishops and not by priests only. The answer is that the superaltars (ἀντιμένσια) which are
made by the bishops when a church is consecrated, suffice oratories in lieu of consecration
or enthronement when they are sent to them, on the occasion of their dedication or opening.
They are called ἀντιμένσια because they are in place of, and are antitypes of those many
like tables which furnish thoroughly the holy Lord’s table.</p>
<p>On the rite of consecrating churches with reliques see Cardinal Bona. (De Rebus Lit.,
Lib. I., cap. xix.)</p>
<p>The Antimensia are consecrated at the same time as the church; a full account of the
ceremony is found in the Euchologion (Goar’s ed., p. 648). A piece of cloth is placed on the
altar and blessed, and then subsequently, as need requires, pieces are cut off from it and sent
to the various oratories, etc. The main outline of the ceremony of consecration is as follows.</p>

<p>Relics being pounded up with fragrant gum, oil is poured over them by the bishop, and,
distilling out to the corporals, is supposed to convey to them the mysterious virtues of the
relics themselves. The holy Eucharist must then be celebrated on them for seven days, after
which they are sent forth as they are wanted.</p>

<p>Since certain, erring in the superstitions of the Hebrews, have thought to mock at Christ
our God, and feigning to be converted to the religion of Christ do deny him, and in private
and secretly keep the Sabbath and observe other Jewish customs, we decree that such persons
be not received to communion, nor to prayers, nor into the Church; but let them be openly
Hebrews according to their religion, and let them not bring their children to baptism, nor
purchase or possess a slave. But if any of them, out of a sincere heart and in faith, is converted
and makes profession with his whole heart, setting at naught their customs and observances,
and so that others may be convinced and converted, such an one is to be received and baptized,
and his children likewise; and let them be taught to take care to hold aloof from the
ordinances of the Hebrews. But if they will not do this, let them in no wise be received.</p>

<p>The Greek commentators Balsamon and Zonaras understood the words “nor to baptize
their children” to mean, “these seeming Christians may not ‘baptize their own children,’”

own children, and the true sense of the words in question comes out clearly from the second

<p>What here is styled Episcopium was the palace of the Patriarch. In this palace were the
archives, and this was called the “Cartophylacium,” in which the charts and episcopal laws
were laid up. To this there was a prefect, the grand Chartophylax, one of the principal officials
and of most exalted dignity of the Church of Constantinople, whose office Codinus explains
as follows: “The Chartophylax has in his keeping all the charts which pertain to ecclesiastical
law (that is to say the letters in which privileges and other rights of the Church are
contained) and is the judge of all ecclesiastical causes, and presides over marriage controversies
which are taken cognizance of, and proceedings for dissolution of the marriage bond;
moreover, he is judge in other clerical strifes, as the right hand of the Patriarch.”</p>
<p>In this Cartophylaceum or Archives, therefore, under the faithful guardianship of the

<p>Since certain of the clergy, misinterpreting the canonical constitutions, leave their own

up their abode with princes, celebrating liturgies in their oratories, it is not permitted to
receive such persons into any house or church without the license of their own Bishop and
also that of the Bishop of Constantinople. And if any clerk shall do this without such license,
and shall so continue, let him be deposed. With regard to those who have done this with
the knowledge of the aforesaid Bishops, it is not lawful for them to undertake mundane and
secular responsibilities, since this is forbidden by the sacred canons. And if anyone is discovered
holding the office of those who are called Meizoteroi; let him either lay it down, or
be deposed from the priesthood. Let him rather be the instructor of the children and others
of the household, reading to them the Divine Scriptures, for to this end he received the
priesthood.</p>

<p>A clergyman who after leaving his own parish has settled in another far off from his own

<p>Since we are under obligation to guard all the divine canons, we ought by all means to
maintain in its integrity that one which says oeconomi are to be in each church. If the metropolitan
appoints in his Church an oeconomus, he does well; but if he does not, it is permitted
to the Bishop of Constantinople by his own (ἰδίας) authority to choose an oeconomus
for the Church of the Metropolitan. A like authority belongs to the metropolitans, if the
Bishops who are subject to them do not wish to appoint oeconomi in their churches. The
same rule is also to be observed with respect to monasteries.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</p>
<p>If the Metropolitan does not elect an oeconomus of the metropolis, the patriarch shall do
so. If the bishop shall not do so, the Metropolitan shall; for so it seemed good to the fathers
assembled at Chalcedon. The same law shall hold in monasteries.</p>

<p>If bishop or hegumenos is found alienating any part of the farm lands of the bishoprick

such act is null according to the canon of the holy Apostles, which says: “Let the bishop
take care of all the Church’s goods, and let him administer the same according as in the
sight of God.” It is not lawful for him to appropriate any part himself, or to confer upon
his relations the things which belong to God. If they are poor let them be helped among
the poor; but let them not be used as a pretext for smuggling away the Church’s property.
And if it be urged that the land is only a loss and yields no profit, the place is not on that
account to be given to the secular rulers, who are in the neighbourhood; but let it be given
to clergymen or husbandmen. And if they have resorted to dishonest craft, so that the ruler
has bought the land from the husbandman or cleric, such transaction shall likewise be null,
and the land shall be restored to the bishoprick or monastery. And the bishop or hegumenos
doing this shall be turned out, the bishop from his bishoprick and the hegumenos from his
monastery, as those who wasted what they did not gather.</p>

<p>As at the time of this Synod by the favour of kings and princes the way was frequently
open to ecclesiastical dignities, clergymen might easily be induced through ambition to
make over to princes some part of the Church’s possessions, if only by so doing they might
arrive at the coveted preferment through their patronage, and then desiring to make good
this simoniacal promise, they studied to transfer the church’s goods to their patrons; with
regard to these the present decree of the synod was made.</p>
<p>But because human ambition is cunning, and solicitously seeks a way of attaining its
ends, ambitious clerics tried by various colouring to give a tone to and to palliate these
translations of church-goods to princes and magistrates, so that they might attain to that

<head>Canon XIII.</head>
<p>That they are worthy of special condemnation who turn the monasteries into public houses.</p>
<p>During the calamity which was brought to pass in the Churches, because of our sins,
some of the sacred houses, for example, bishops’ palaces and monasteries, were seized by
certain men and became public inns. If those who now hold them choose to give them back,
so that they may be restored to their original use, well and good; but if not, and these persons
are on the sacerdotal list, we command that they be deposed; if they be monks or laymen,
that they be excommunicated, as those who have been condemned from the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and assigned their place where the worm dieth not and the
fire is not quenched, because they set themselves against the voice of the Lord, which says:
“Make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</p>
<p>Those who make common diocesan or monastic goods, unless they restore to the bishop
or superior the things belonging to the diocese or monastery, the whole proceeding shall be
null. If they are persons in Holy Orders they shall be deposed, but if laymen or monks they
shall be cast out.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>No doubt by “the calamity” here is intended a reference to the troubles occasioned by
the Iconoclasts, during whose time of domination many nefarious things were perpetrated
against the orthodox, and most bitter of all was the persecution of the monks and priests
by Leo the Isaurian and by his son Constantine Copronymus, both of them supporters of
the Iconoclasts.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that by this persecution and through the nefarious vexations of
the Iconoclasts, many monks and clerics fled from their monasteries and left vacant the
Episcopia or holy houses, and so it became easy for people to come in and occupy the empty
monasteries and religious houses, and to turn them to common and profane uses, especially
when the anger of the Emperors and of the Iconoclasts was known to be fierce against the
monks, and such bishops and priests as were worshippers of images.</p>

<head>Canon XIV.</head>
<p>That no one without ordination ought to read in the ambo during the synaxis.</p>
<p>That there is a certain order established in the priesthood is very evident to all, and to
guard diligently the promotions of the priesthood is well pleasing to God. Since therefore
we see certain youths who have received the clerical tonsure, but who have not yet received
ordination from the bishop, reading in the ambo during the Synaxis, and in doing this violating
the canons, we forbid this to be done (from henceforth,) and let this prohibition be
observed also amongst the monks. It is permitted to each hegumenos in his own monastery
to ordain a reader, if he himself had received the laying on of hands by a bishop to the dignity
of hegumenos, and is known to be a presbyter. Chorepiscopi may likewise, according to
ancient custom and with the bishop’s authorization, appoint readers.541</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</p>
<p>No one shall read from the ambon unless he has been ordained by the bishop. And this
shall be in force also among monks. The superior of a monastery, if he has been ordained by
the bishop, may ordain a lector but only in his own monastery. A chorepiscopus also can
make a lector.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>I say therefore from this present canon and from canon xix. that they may properly be
made superiors, who have never received holy orders; since women may be placed in such
positions in our monasteries. And as these women do not hear confessions, nor make
readers, so neither do superiors do this who are neither monks nor priests, nor could they</p>

<p>Van Espen (l. c. p. 469 sqq., and Jus Canon., t. i. pt. xxxi. tit. 31, c. 6), professes to show
(a) that at that time there was no special benediction of abbots (different from their ordination
as priests), and that therefore the words, “if he (the superior of the monastery) himself is
consecrated by the bishop to the office of hegumenus,” and “evidently is a priest,” mean the
same; (b) that at the time of our Synod every superior of a monastery, a prior as well as an
abbot, had the power of conferring upon the monks of his monastery the order of lector;
but (c) that the way in which Anastasius translated the canon (si dumtaxat Abbati manus
impositio facta noscatur ab episcopo secundum morem præficiendorum abbatum), and the

<p>That a clerk ought not to be set over two churches.</p>
<p>From henceforth no clergyman shall be appointed over two churches, for this savours
of merchandise and filthy lucre, and is altogether alien from ecclesiastical custom. We have
heard by the very voice of the Lord that, “No man can serve two masters, for either he will
hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.” Each
one, therefore, as says the Apostle, in the calling wherein he was called, in the same he ought
to abide, and in one only church to give attendance. For in the affairs of the Church, what
is gained through filthy lucre is altogether separate from God. To meet the necessities of
this life, there are various occupations, by means of which, if one so desire, let him procure
the things needful for the body. For says the Apostle, “These hands have ministered unto
my necessities, and to them that were with me.” Occupations of this sort may be obtained
in the God-protected city. But in the country places outside, because of the small number
of people, let a dispensation be granted.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.</p>
<p>Hereafter at Constantinople a cleric may not serve two churches. But in the outskirts this
may be permitted on account of the scarcity of men.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>This means that in the country or where men are so scarce that each parish cannot have
its own presbyter, one presbyter should be allowed to serve two churches, not that so he
may supply his own need, (as to-day is allowed by the combination of benefices), but that
so the necessities of the parishioners may be provided for.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the synod deems it “filthy lucre” and “separate from God” if ecclesiastical
ministries are performed “for the necessaries of life,” and is of opinion that the
clergy should seek their support from some honest employment or work by the example of
Paul, rather than to turn ecclesiastical ministrations to the attaining of temporal things, and
to use these as an art by which to gain bread.</p>

<head>Canon XVI.</head>
<p>That it does not become one in holy orders to be clad in costly apparel.</p>
<p>All buffoonery and decking of the body ill becomes the priestly rank. Therefore those
bishops and clerics who array themselves in gay and showy clothing ought to correct
themselves, and if they do not amend they ought to be subjected to punishment. So likewise
they who anoint themselves with perfumes. When the root of bitterness sprang up, there
was poured into the Catholic Church the pollution of the heresy of the traducers of the
Christians. And such as were defiled by it, not only detested the pictured images, but also
set at naught all decorum, being exceedingly mad against those who lived gravely and religiously;
so that in them was fulfilled that which is written, “The service of God is abominable
to the sinner.” If therefore, any are found deriding those who are clad in poor and grave
raiment, let them be corrected by punishment. For from early times every man in holy orders
wore modest and grave clothing; and verily whatever is worn, not so much because of necessity,
as for the sake of outward show, savours of dandyism, as says Basil the Great. Nor did
anyone array himself in raiment embroidered with silk, nor put many coloured ornaments
on the border of his garments; for they had heard from the lips of God that “They that wear
soft clothing are in kings’ houses.”</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.</p>
<p>Bishops and clergymen arraying themselves in splendid clothes and anointed with perfumes
must be corrected. Should they persist, they must be punished.</p>
<p>Balsamon and Zonaras tell of the magnificence in dress assumed by some of the superior
clergy among the Iconoclasts, wearing stuffs woven with threads of gold, and their loins
girt with golden girdles, and sentences embroidered in gold on the edge of their raiment.
It is curious to note how often heretics fall into extremes. We have seen how Eustathius
wore a conspicuous garb and was not willing to appear in the ordinary dress of a clergyman
of his day. His was the one extreme of ultra clerical or, I should say, ascetic clothing. These
Iconoclasts went to the other extreme and dressed themselves like men of the world, giving
themselves the dandy airs of the fops of the day, thus, as always, making themselves ridiculous
in the eyes of the wise, and their office contemptible in the eyes of the common people.</p>

<p>That women ought not to live in bishops’ houses, nor in monasteries of men.</p>
<p>“Be ye without offence to those who are without,” says the divine Apostle. Now for
women to live in Bishops’ houses or in monasteries is ground for grave offence. Whoever
therefore is known to have a female slave or freewoman in the episcopal palace or in a
monastery for the discharge of some service, let him be rebuked. And if he still continue
to retain her, let him be deposed. If it happens that women are on the suburban estates,
and the bishop or hegumenos desires to go thither, so long as the bishop or hegumenos is
present, let no woman at that time continue her work, but let her betake herself to some
other place until the bishop [or hegumenos542] has departed, so that there be no occasion
of complaint.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.</p>
<p>It is not fitting that women should be kept in episcopal houses or in monasteries. If anyone
shall dare to do so, he shall be reproved; but if he persists, he shall be deposed. No woman is
allowed to serve or even to appear where a bishop or a superior of a monastery is present, but
let her keep herself apart until he be gone.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>Every woman the present canon expels from the Episcopium or bishop’s house, agreeably
to Novel CXXIII, chapter 29, of the Emperor Justinian, which, (although the Nicene canon
on the subject makes a mother, sister, daughter and other persons free from all suspicions,
exceptions), admits no exceptions in the case of a bishop, but says, “We allow no bishop to
have any woman or to live with one.”</p>
<p>For as bishops are set in a higher grade above the rest of the clergy, and ought to be like
lights set on a candlestick to give light, rightly they are ordered more than others to take
care to avoid all appearance of evil, and to remove all from them that might cause suspicion.</p>

<head>Canon XIX.</head>
<p>That the vows of those in holy orders and of monks, and of nuns are to be made without
the exaction of gifts.</p>
<p>The abomination of filthy lucre has made such inroads among the rulers of the churches,
that certain of those who call themselves religious men and women, forgetting the commandments
of the Lord have been altogether led astray, and for the sake of money have received
those presenting themselves for the sacerdotal order and the monastic life. And hence the
first step of those so received being unlawful, the whole proceeding is rendered null, as says
Basil the Great. For it is not possible that God should be served by means of mammon.543
If therefore, anyone is found doing anything of this kind, if he be a bishop or hegumenos,
or one of the priesthood, either let him cease to do so any longer or else let him be deposed,
according to the second canon of the Holy Council of Chalcedon. If the offender be an abbess,
let her be sent away from her monastery, and placed in another in a subordinate position.
In like manner is a hegumenos to be dealt with, who has not the ordination of a presbyter.
With regard to what has been given by parents as a dowry for their children, or which
persons themselves have contributed out of their own property, with the declaration that
such gifts were made to God, we have decreed, that whether the persons in whose behalf
the gifts were made, continue to live in the monastery or not, the gifts are to remain with
the monastery in accordance with their first determination; unless indeed there be ground
for complaint against the superior.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</p>
<p>Whoever for money admits those coming to Holy Orders or to the monastic life, if he be
bishop, or superior of a monastery or any other in sacred orders, shall either cease or be deposed.
And the Superior of a monastery of women shall be expelled [if she have done so] and
shall be given over to subjection. The same shall be the case with a superior of monks, if he
be not a priest. But the possessions brought by those who come in, let them remain, whether
the persons remain or not, provided the superior be not to blame.</p>
<p>Balsamon.</p>
<p>But someone may ask how it is that canon V., orders that he that performs an ordination
for money is eo ipso to be deposed, whereas this canon provides that he who receives a
cleric or monk on account of a pecuniary gift is to cease or else to be deposed. The answer
<note type="footnote">543 Bev. “To serve God and mammon.”</note>

<pb n="1111"/>
is, that whenever anyone performs an ordination for money, according to canon V., he is
to be deposed; but when it was only a reception of a person which took place, whether into
the list of the clergy or into a monastery by reason of money, who did this is only to be deposed,
if after being denounced he persists in this evil. The canons therefore are diverse in
their scope. The fifth treats of unlawful ordination, but this one of improper receptions.</p>

<p>That from henceforth, no double monastery shall be erected; and concerning the double

<p>We decree that from henceforth, no double monastery shall be erected; because this has
become an offence and cause of complaint to many. In the case of those persons who with
the members of their family propose to leave the world and follow the monastic life, let the
men go into a monastery for men, and the women into a monastery for women; for this is
well-pleasing to God. The double monasteries which are already in existence, shall observe
the rule of our holy Father Basil, and shall be ordered by his precepts, monks and nuns shall
not dwell together in the same monastery, for in thus living together adultery finds its occasion.
No monk shall have access to a nunnery; nor shall a nun be permitted to enter a
monastery for the sake of conversing with anyone therein. No monk shall sleep in a monastery
for women, nor eat alone with a nun.544 When food is brought by men to the canonesses,
let the abbess accompanied by some one of the aged nuns, receive it outside the gates
of the women’s monastery. When a monk desires to see one of his kinswomen, who may
be in the nunnery, let him converse with her in the presence of the abbess, and that in a very
few words, and then let him speedily take his departure.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.</p>
<p>Monasteries shall not be double, neither shall monks and nuns live in the same building,
nor shall they talk together apart. Moreover if a man takes anything to a canoness, let him
wait without and hand it to her, and let him see his relative in the presence of her superior.</p>
<p>Van Espen.</p>
<p>It is evident, as Zonaras remarks, that the double monasteries here referred to are not
those in which men and women live together, in one house, which in this canon is not tolerated
at all, but those which were situated so close together that it was evident there could
easily be an entrance from one to the other, these are allowed under certain cautions by this
canon.</p>
<p>But not only the Greeks but the Latins also often disapproved of such monasteries. See

professing the rule of St. Augustine, with the additions called by them the Rule of the
Saviour. “These two convents had one church in common, the nuns lived in the upper part
under the roof, the brothers on the ground-floor, and each convent had a separate inclosure;
and after profession no one went forth, except by special licence of the Lord Pope.”</p>

however proper that he be made a member of the monastery, without the consent of his
hegumenos.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.</p>
<p>It is not allowed to a monk or a nun to leave her own house and enter another; but if he
(or she) enters let (him or her) be received as a guest; but let him (or her) not be admitted at
all nor given hospitality contrary to the will of the superior.</p>
<p>Aristenus.</p>
<p>The present canon does not allow a monk or a nun who goes to another house to be
received into, nor even to be admitted as a guest, lest by force of necessity he be led astray
to worldly things and so remain. Moreover it does not permit a woman to be admitted and
received and reckoned in the number of the sisters without the consent of the superior.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in Aristenus an οὐκ must have crept into the text and that the first
sentence should read as now but omitting the “not.” This makes him agree with Zonaras
who says “the man must be received as a guest lest he go to a profane tavern and be forced
to associate with those who have never learned how to live decently.” It is clear that the
“superior” referred to is that of the house whence the monk or nun went forth.</p>

<head>Canon XXII.</head>
<p>That when it happens that monks have to eat with women they ought to observe giving
of thanks, and abstemiousness, and discretion.</p>
<p>To surrender all things to God, and not to serve our own wills, is great gain. For says
the divine Apostle, “whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God.” And Christ our
God has bidden us in his Gospels, to cut off the beginning of sins; for not only is adultery
rebuked by him, but even the movement of the mind towards the act of adultery when he
says, “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her
already in his heart.” We who have been thus taught ought therefore to purify our minds.
Now although all things are lawful, all things are not expedient, as we have been taught by
the mouth of the Apostle. It is needful that all men should eat in order that they may live.
And for those to whom life consists of marrying, and bringing forth children, and of the
condition of the lay state, there is nothing unbecoming in men and women eating together,
only let them give thanks to the giver of the food; but if there be the entertainments of the
theatre, that is, Satanic songs accompanied with the meretricious inflections of harps, there
come upon them, through these things, the curse of the prophet, who thus speaks: “Woe
to them who drink wine with harp and psaltery, but they regard not the works of the Lord,
and consider not the works of his hands.” Whenever persons of this sort are found among
Christians, let them amend their ways; but if they will not do so, let there overtake them the
penalties which have been enacted in the canons by our predecessors. With regard to those
whose life is free from care and apart from men, that is, those who have resolved before the
Lord God to carry the solitary yoke, they should sit down alone and in silence. Moreover
it is also altogether unlawful for those who have chosen the priestly life to eat in private with
women, unless it be with God-fearing and discreet men and women, so that even their feast
may be turned to spiritual edification. The same rule is to be observed with relatives. Again,
if it happen that a monk or priest while on a journey does not have with him what is absolutely
necessary for him, and, because of his pressing needs, thinks well to turn aside into
an inn or into someone’s house, this he is permitted to do, seeing that need compels.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.</p>
<p>There is no objection to laywomen eating with men: it is not right however for men who
have chosen the lonely life, to eat privately with women; unless perchance together with them
that fear God and with religious men and women. But when travelling, a monk or anyone
in sacred orders, not carrying necessary provisions with him, may enter a public house.</p>

<p>(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 577.)</p>
<p>To our most religious and most serene princes, Constantine and Irene his mother.
Tarasius, the unworthy bishop of your God-protected royal city, new Rome, and all the holy
Council which met at the good pleasure of God and upon the command of your Christloving
majesty in the renowned metropolis of Nice, the second council to assemble in this
city.</p>
<p>Christ our God (who is the head of the Church) was glorified, most noble princes, when
your heart, which he holds in his hands, gave forth that good word bidding us to assemble
in his name, in order that we might strengthen our hold on the sure, immovable, and Godgiven
truth contained in the Church’s dogmas. As your heads were crowned with gold and
most brilliant stones, so likewise were your minds adorned with the precepts of the Gospel
and the teachings of the Fathers. And being the disciples and companions, as it were, of
those whose sounds went forth into all the earth, ye became the leaders in the way of piety
of all who bore the name of Christ, setting forth clearly the word of truth, and giving a
brilliant example of orthodoxy and piety; so that ye were to the faithful as so many burning
lamps. The Church which was ready to fall, ye upheld with your hands, strengthening it
with sound doctrine, and bringing into the unity of a right judgment those who were at
variance. We may therefore well say with boldness that it was through you that the good
pleasure of God brought about the triumph of godliness, and filled our mouth with joy and
our tongue with gladness. And these things our lips utter with a formal decree. For what
is more glorious than to maintain the Church’s interests; and what else is more calculated
to provoke our gladness?</p>
<p>Certain men rose up, having the form of godliness, inasmuch as they were clothed with
the dignity of the priesthood, but denying the power thereof; and thus deserving for themselves
the charge of being but priests of Babylon. Of such the word of prophecy had before
declared that “lawlessness went forth from the priests545 of Babylon.” Nay more, they
banded themselves together in a sanhedrim, like to that which Caiaphas held, and became
the propagators of ungodly doctrines. And having a mouth full of cursing and bitterness,
they thought to win the mastery by means of abusive words. With a slanderous tongue and
a pen of a like character, and objecting to the very terms used by God himself, they devised
marvellous tales, and then proceeded to stigmatise as idolaters the royal priesthood and the
holy nation, even those who had put on Christ, and by his grace had been kept safe from
the folly of idols. And having a mind set upon evil, they took in hand unlawful deeds,
<note type="footnote">545 “Presbyters” in LXX.</note>

<pb n="1118"/>
thinking to suppress altogether the depicting of the venerable images. Accordingly, as many
icons as were set in mosaic work they dug out, and those which were in painted waxwork,
they scraped away; thus turning the comely beauty of the sacred temples into complete
disorder. Among doings of this sort, it is to be specially noted that the pictures set up on
tablets in memory of Christ our God and of his Saints, they gave over to the flames. Finally,
in a word, having desecrated our churches, they reduced them to utter confusion. Then
some bishops became the leaders of this heresy and where before was peace, they fomented
strife among the people; and instead of wheat sowed tares in the Church’s fields. They
mingled wine with water, and gave the foul draught to those about them. Although but
Arabian wolves, they hid themselves under sheeps’ clothing, and by specious reasoning
against the truth sought to commend their lie. But all the while “they hatched asps’ eggs
and wove a spider’s web,” as says the prophet; and “he that would eat of their eggs, having
crushed one, found it to be addled, with a basilisk within it,” and giving forth a deadly stench.</p>
<p>In such a state of affairs, with a lie busy destroying the truth, ye, most gracious and most
noble princes, did not idly allow so grave a plague, and such soul-destroying error long to
continue in your day. But moved by the divine Spirit which abideth in you, ye set yourselves
with all your strength utterly to exterminate it, and thus preserve the stability of the Church’s
government, and likewise concord among your subjects; so that your whole empire might
be established in peace agreeably with the name [Irene] you bear. Ye rightly reasoned, that
it was not to be patiently endured, that while in other matters we could be of one mind and
live in concord, yet in what ought to be the chief concern of our life, the peace of the
Churches, there was amongst us strife and division. And that too, when Christ being our
head, we ought to be members one of another, and one body, by our mutual agreement and
faith. Accordingly, ye commanded our holy and numerously-attended council to assemble
in the metropolis of Nice, in order that after having rid the Church of division, we might
restore to unity the separated members, and might be careful to rend and utterly destroy
the coarse cloak of false doctrine, which they had woven of thorn fibre, and unfold again
the fair robe of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>And now having carefully traced the traditions of the Apostles and Fathers, we are bold
to speak. Having but one mind by the inbreathing of the most Holy Spirit, and being all
knit together in one, and understanding the harmonious tradition of the Catholic Church,
we are in perfect harmony with the symphonies set forth by the six, holy and ecumenical
councils; and accordingly we have anathematised the madness of Arius, the frenzy of
Macedonius, the senseless understanding of Appolinarius, the man-worship of Nestorius,
the irreverent mingling of the natures devised by Eutyches and Dioscorus, and the manyheaded
hydra which is their companion. We have also anathematised the idle tales of Origen,
Didymus, and Evagrius; and the doctrine of one will held by Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, and
Pyrrhus, or rather, we have anathematised their own evil will. Finally, taught by the Spirit,

<pb n="1119"/>
from whom we have drawn pure water, we have with one accord and one soul, altogether
wiped out with the sponge of the divine dogmas the newly devised heresy, well-worthy to
be classed with those just mentioned, which springing up after them, uttered such empty
nonsense about the sacred icons. And the contrivers of this vain, but revolutionary babbling
we have cast forth far from the Church’s precincts.</p>
<p>And as the hands and feet are moved in accordance with the directions of the mind, so
likewise, we, having received the grace and strength of the Spirit, and having also the assistance
and co-operation of your royal authority, have with one voice declared as piety and
proclaimed as truth: that the sacred icons of our Lord Jesus Christ are to be had and retained,
inasmuch as he was very man; also those which set forth what is historically narrated in the
Gospels; and those which represent our undefiled Lady, the holy Mother of God; and likewise
those of the Holy Angels (for they have manifested themselves in human form to those who
were counted worthy of the vision of them), or of any of the Saints. <del>We have also decreed</del>
that the brave deeds of the Saints be pourtrayed on tablets and on the walls, and upon the
sacred vessels and vestments, as hath been the custom of the holy Catholic Church of God
from ancient times; which custom was regarded as having the force of law in the teaching
both of those holy leaders who lived in the first ages of the Church, and also of their successors
our reverend Fathers. <del>We have likewise decreed</del> that these images are to be reverenced
(προσκυνεῖν), that is, salutations are to be offered to them. The reason for using the
word is, that it has a two-fold signification. For κυνεῖν in the old Greek tongue signifies
both “to salute” and “to kiss.” And the preposition προς gives to it the additional idea of
strong desire towards the subject; as for example, we have φέρω and προσφέρω, κυρῶ and
προσκυρῶ, and so also we have κυνέω and προσκυνέω. Which last word implies salutation
and strong love; for that which one loves he also reverences (προσκυνεῖ) and what he reverences
that he greatly loves, as the everyday custom, which we observe towards those we love,
bears witness, and in which both ideas are practically illustrated when two friends meet together.
The word is not only made use of by us, but we also find it set down in the Divine
Scriptures by the ancients. For it is written in the histories of the Kings, “And David rose
up and fell upon his face and did reverence to (προσεκυνήσε) Jonathan three times and
kissed him” (1 Kings xx. 41). And what is it that the Lord in the Gospel says concerning
the Pharisees? “They love the uppermost rooms at feasts and greetings (ἀσπασμοὺς) in the
markets.” It is evident that by “greetings” here, he means reverence (προσκύνησιν) for the
Pharisees being very high-minded and thinking themselves to be righteous were eager to
be reverenced by all, but not <del>merely</del> to be kissed. For to receive salutations of this latter
sort savoured too much of lowly humility, and this was not to the Pharisees’ liking. We
have also the example of Paul the divine Apostle, as Luke in the Acts of the Apostles relates:
“When we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly, and the day following
Paul went in with us unto James, and all the presbyters were present. And when he had

<pb n="1120"/>
saluted (ἀσπασάμενος) them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among
the Gentiles by his ministry” (Acts xxi. 17, 18, 19). By the salutation here mentioned, the
Apostle evidently intended to render that reverence of honour (τιμητικὴν προσκύνησιν)
which we shew to one another, and of which he speaks when he says concerning Jacob, that
“he reverenced (προσεκύνησεν) the top of his staff” (Heb. xi. 21). With these examples
agrees what Gregory surnamed Theologus says: “Honour Bethlehem, and reverence
(προσκυνήσον) the manger.”</p>
<p>Now who of those rightly and sincerely understanding the Divine Scriptures, has ever
supposed that these examples which we have cited speak of the worship in spirit (τῆς ἐν
πνεύματι λατρείας)? <del>Certainly no one has ever thought so</del> except perhaps some persons
utterly bereft of sense and ignorant of all knowledge of the Scriptures and of the teaching
of the Fathers. Surely Jacob did not adore (ἐλάτρευσεν) the top of his staff; and surely
Gregory Theologus does not bid us to adore (λατρεύειν) the manger? By no means.</p>
<p>Again, when offering salutations to the life-giving Cross, we together sing: “We reverence
(προσκυνῶμεν), thy cross, O Lord, and we also reverence (προσκυνῶμεν) the spear which
opened the life-giving side of thy goodness.” This is clearly but a salutation, and is so called,
and its character is evinced by our touching the things mentioned with our lips. We grant
that the word προσκύνησις is frequently found in the Divine Scriptures and in the writings
of our learned and holy Fathers for the worship in spirit (ἐπὶ της ἐν πνεύματι λατρείας),
since, being a word of many significations, it may be used to express that kind of reverence
which is service. As there is also the veneration of honour, love and fear. In this sense it is,
that we venerate your glorious and most noble majesty. So also there is another veneration
which comes of fear alone, thus Jacob venerated Esau. Then there is the veneration of
gratitude, as Abraham reverenced the sons of Heth, for the field which he received from
them for a burying place for Sarah his wife. And finally, those looking to obtain some gift,
venerate those who are above them, as Jacob venerated Pharaoh. Therefore because this
term has these many significations, the Divine Scriptures teaching us, “Thou shalt venerate
the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve,” says simply that veneration is to be given
to God, but does not add the word “only;” for veneration being a word of wide meaning is
an ambiguous term; but it goes on to say “thou shalt serve (λατρεύσεις) him only,” for to
God alone do we render latria.</p>
<p>The things which we have decreed, being thus well supported, it is confessedly and
beyond all question acceptable and well-pleasing before God, that the images of our Lord
Jesus Christ as man, and those of the undefiled Mother of God, the ever-virgin Mary, and
of the honourable Angels and of all Saints, should be venerated and saluted. And if anyone
does not so believe, but undertakes to debate the matter further and is evil affected with regard
to the veneration due the sacred images, such an one our holy ecumenical council (fortified
by the inward working of the Spirit of God, and by the traditions of the Fathers and of the

<pb n="1121"/>
Church) anathematises. Now anathema is nothing less than complete separation from God.
For if any are quarrelsome and will not obediently accept what has now been decreed, they
but kick against the pricks, and injure their own souls in their fighting against Christ. And
in taking pleasure at the insults which are offered to the Church, they clearly shew themselves
to be of those who madly make war upon piety, and are therefore to be regarded as in the
same category with the heretics of old times, and their companions and brethren in ungodliness.</p>
<p>We have sent our brethren and fellow priests, God-beloved Bishops, together with certain
of the Hegumenoi and clergy, that they may give a full report of our proceedings to your
godly-hearing ears. In proof and confirmation of what we have decreed, and also for the
assurance of your most religious majesty, we have submitted proofs from the Fathers, a few
of the many we have gathered together in illustration of the brightly shining truth.</p>
<p>And now may the Saviour of us all, who reigns with you (συμβασιλεύων ὑμῖν) and who
was pleased to vouchsafe his peace to the Churches through you, preserve your kingdom
for many years, and also your council, princes, and faithful army, and the whole estate of
the empire; and may he also give you victory over all your enemies. For he it is, who says:
“As I live, saith the Lord, they that glorify me, I will glorify.” He it is also who hath girded
you with strength, and will smite all your enemies, and make your people to rejoice.</p>
<p>And do thou, O city, the new Sion, rejoice and be glad; thou that art the wonder of the
whole world. For although David hath not reigned in thee, nevertheless thy pious princes
here preside over thy affairs as David would have done. The Lord is in the midst of thee;
may his name be blessed forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Two Letters of Gregory II. To the Emperor Leo.</head>
<p>(J. B. Bury, Appendix 14 to Vol. V. of his edition of Gibbon’s Rome. 1898.)</p>
<p>It is incorrect to say that “the two epistles of Gregory II. have been preserved in the Acts
of the Nicene Council” <del>as Gibbon does</del>. In modern collections of the Acts of Ecclesiastical
Councils, they have been printed at the end of the Acts of the Second Nicene Council. But
they first came to light at the end of the XVIth. century and were printed for the first time
in the Annales Ecclesiastici of Baronius, who had obtained them from Fronton le Duc. This
scholar had copied the text from a Greek ms. at Rheims. Since then other mss. have been
found, the earliest belonging to the XIth., if not the Xth century.</p>
<p>In another case we should say that the external evidence for the genuineness of the
epistles was good. We know on the authority of Theophanes that Gregory wrote one or
more letters to Leo (ἐπιστολὴν δογματικήν , sub a. m. 6172, οι ἐπιστολῶν, sub a. m. 6221);
and we should have no external reasons to suspect copies dating from about 300 years later.
But the omission of these letters in the Acts of the Nicene Council, though they are stated
to have been read at the council, introduces a shadow of suspicion. If they were preserved,
how comes it that they were not preserved in the Acts of the Council, like the letter of
Gregory to the Patriarch Germanus? There is no trace anywhere of the Latin originals.</p>
<p>Turning to the contents, we find enough to convert suspicion into a practical certainty
that the documents are forgeries. This is the opinion of M. l’abbé Duchesne (the editor of
the Liber Pontificalis), M. L. Guérard (Mélanges d’Archéologie et d’Histoire, p. 44 sqq., 1890);
Mr. Hodgkin (Italy and her Invaders, Vol. vi., p. 501 sqq.). A false date (the beginning of
Leo’s reign is placed in the XIVth. instead of the XVth. indiction), and the false implication
that the Imperial territory of the “Ducatus Romæ” terminated at twenty-four stadia, or three
miles, from Rome, point to an author who was neither a contemporary of Leo nor a resident
in Rome. But the insolent tone of the letters is enough to condemn them. Gregory II. would
never have addressed to his sovereign the crude abuse with which these documents teem.
Another objection (which I have never seen noticed) is that in the First Letter the famous
image of Christ which was pulled down by Leo, is stated to have been in the “Chalkoprateia”
(bronzesmith’s quarter), whereas, according to the trustworthy sources, it was above the
Chalkâ gate of the Palace.</p>
<p>Rejecting the letters on these grounds—which are supported by a number of smaller
points—we get rid of the difficulty about a Lombard siege of Ravenna before a.d. 727: a
siege which is not mentioned elsewhere and was doubtless created by the confused knowledge
of the fabricator.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Reception of the Seventh Council.</head>
<p>The reception of the Seventh Council in the East was practically universal. No historian
pretends that the iconoclastic opinions had any hold over the masses of the people. It was
strictly speaking a court movement, backed by the army, and whenever the images were
laid low and their veneration condemned it was by the power of the State, enforcing its will
upon a yielding and (as we would call them to-day) Erastian clergy. (Cf. Harnack, History
of Dogma, Eng. tr. Vol. iv., p. 326.)</p>
<p>The struggle indeed was not quite put an end to by the conciliar decree. After the death
of the Empress in a.d. 803, several iconoclastic rulers sat on the throne of the East, among
them Michael the Stammerer, who (as Michaud wittily says) “fought the images and married
the nuns.”546 He sent a letter, which is still extant, to Louis le Débonnaire of France, setting
forth the superstitions of the orthodox, which is most curious and interesting reading. (Vide
Mansi.)</p>
<p>His successor was Theophilus, who reigned from 829 until 842, and was a fanatical
iconoclast. The Patriarchs of Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem wrote to him officially,
several years after his accession, begging him not to imitate the bad example of the iconoclasts.
At that time the only Patriarch who sided with the heretics was John the Grammarian,
the Patriarch of Constantinople, the very same who in 814 had repudiated the iconoclast
doctrine! With the death of this Emperor, the power of the Iconoclasts likewise died; and
at the accession of Michael III with his mother Theodora and his sister Thecla came the final
triumph of the images. I shall quote here the words of Harnack: “Then came an Empress,
Theodora, who finally restored the worship. This took place at the Synod held at Constantinople
a.d. 842. This Synod decreed that a Feast of Orthodoxy (ἡ κυριακὴ τῆς
ὀρθοδοξίας ) should be celebrated annually, at which the victory over the iconoclasts should
be regularly remembered. Thus the whole of orthodoxy was united in image-worship. In
this way the Eastern Church reached the position which suited its nature. We have here
the conclusion of a development, consistent in the main points. The divine and sacred, as
that had descended into the sensuous world by the incarnation, had created for itself in the
<note type="footnote">546 It was during this period that St. Theodore, writing in 826 to Arsenius, observes: “Rome has not received
it as an Ecumenical Council, but only as a provincial Synod, assembled to remedy a particular evil; Legates of
the other Patriarchs were not there; those of Rome had come on different business: Legates, indeed, there were
from the East, but they were brought by our deputies, not sent by their Patriarchs, who knew nothing of the
matter till afterwards. Our countrymen acted thus for the purpose of more easily bringing back the heretics by
persuading them that it was an OEcumenical Council.” “Theodore, however, it is fair to add, afterwards changed
his opinion.” Such is Dr. Neale’s candid admission. Hist. of the East. Ch., Vol. II., p. 135. How often, alas! has
this passage been quoted by controversialists, and the word of warning to the reader been wholly omitted.</note>

<pb n="1124"/>
Church a system of material, supernatural things, which offered themselves for man’s use.”
(Hist. Dogma. Vol. iv., p. 328.)</p>
<p>Much has been written, and truly written, of the superiority of the iconoclastic rulers;
but when all has been said that can be, the fact still remains, that they were most of them
but sorry Christians, and the justice of the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin’s summing up
of the matter will not be disputed by any impartial student. He says, “No one will deny that
with rarest exceptions, all the religious earnestness, all which constituted the quickening
power of a church, was ranged upon the other <del>i.e. the orthodox</del> side. Had the Iconoclasts
triumphed, when their work showed itself at last in its true colours, it would have proved
to be the triumph, not of faith in an invisible God, but of frivolous unbelief in an incarnate
Saviour.” (Trench. Mediæval History, Chap. vii.)</p>
<p>We come now to consider what reception the Seventh of the General Councils met with
in the West. And first we find that it was accepted, so far at least as its dogmatic decrees
went, by the Pope, the whole Roman Church and, so far as we know, by all the West except
the realm of Charlemagne and, as would naturally be expected, the English Church.</p>
<p>It is true that this was a large and very important exception; so large and so important
that it becomes necessary to examine in detail the causes which led to this rejection.</p>
<p>Some persons have supposed that the English council held at Calcuth in 787 rejected
the ecumenical character of II. Nice, because in two of its canons (the 1st and the 4th) it
only speaks of “the faith of the Six General Councils.” But it is evident that the reason for
this was that it had not yet heard of the Nicene synod; moreover such action would have
been clearly impossible, since the council was presided over by the Bishop of Ostia, the
legate of Pope Hadrian.</p>
<p>The first opposition to the council in the West was made apparently by Charlemagne
himself. Pope Hadrian sent him a translation of the acts into Latin and signified his accept
ance of the council. But this translation was so badly done that not only was a large part of
the acts utterly unintelligible, but also, in at least one place, a bishop of the council was made
to say that the sacred images were to be adored with the same supreme worship as is paid
to the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>It may not be wholly charitable to suggest the possibility of such a thing having any influence
in the matter. On the other hand it would be unfair to the reader not to state that
Charlemagne had, or thought that he had, serious grievances against the Empress Irene,
and that he might not have been sorry to have discovered some reason for which to reject
her council. It should, moreover, be remembered how much the Pope in his struggle for
independence of the Eastern Empire trusted to Charlemagne, and therefore how reluctant
he might readily have been to break with so important an ally; and so might be induced to
tolerate the rejection by the Frankish Emperor of what had been received by him, the Vicar
of Christ and the successor of Peter, as the Seventh Ecumenical Synod of the Catholic Church.</p>

<pb n="1125"/>
<p>As a result of this feeling of Charlemagne’s, there were written what we call the “Caroline
Books,” and these exercised so mighty an influence on this whole question, and so completely
misled even the learned, that I shall give a careful examination of their authorship, authority,
and contents; for there can be no doubt that it was the influence of these books (which appeared
in 790) that induced the unfortunate action of the Council of Frankfort four years
later (in 794); and that of the Convention of Paris in 825.</p>

<head>Examination of the Caroline Books.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<head>I. Authorship of the Caroline Books.</head>
<p>I find that many writers on the subject of what they call “image worship,” speak frequently
of these “Caroline Books,” and refer to them with great admiration. It is also absolutely
certain that many of these writers have never read, possibly never seen, the books of
which they write so eloquently. I have used the reprint of Melchior Goldast’s edition
(Frankfort, 1608) in Migne’s Patrologia Latina, Tom. xcviij., in this article.</p>
<p>The work begins thus. “In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ beginneth the
work of the most illustrious and glorious man Charles, by the will of God, king of the Franks,
Gauls, Germany, etc., against the Synod which in Greek parts firmly and proudly decreed
in favour of adoring (adorandis) images,” then follows immediately what is called “Charlemagne’s
Preface.”</p>
<p>Now of course nobody supposes for a moment that Charlemagne wrote these books
himself. But Sir William Palmer (Treatise on the Church, Vol. II., p. 204) says that the
prelates of the realm of France “composed a reply to this Synod,” he further says that “This
work was published by the authority and in the name of the Emperor Charlemagne and
with the consent of his bishops, in 790” (p. 205). I am entirely at a loss to know on what
authority these statements rest. The authorship of the work has not without great show of
reason, been attributed to Alcuin. Besides the English tradition that he had written such a
book, there has been pointed out the remarkable similarity of his commentary on St. John
(4, 5, et seqq.) to a passage in Liber IV., cap. vj., of these Caroline Books. (On this point see
Forster, General Preface to the Works of Alcuin n. 10.) But after all whether Alcuin was the
author or no, matters little, the statement that the “bishops of France” were in any sense
responsible for it is entirely gratuitous, unless indeed some should think it may be gathered
from the statement of the Preface;</p>
<p>“We have undertaken this work with the priests who are prelates of the Catholic flocks
in the kingdom which has been granted to us of God.”547 But this would not be the only
book written at the command of, and set forth by, a secular prince and yet claiming the authority
of the Church. I need only give as examples “The Institution of a Christian Man”
and the Second Prayer Book of Edward the VIth.</p>
<note type="footnote">547 It is curious that Michaud (Sept. Conciles OEcuméniques, p. 294) should say “the title priest given to those
who composed the book proves that no one of them was a bishop.” The Latin is “Sacerdotum Prælatorum”!</note>
</div>

<pb n="1127"/>
<head>II. Authority of the Caroline Books.</head>
<p>But be their authorship what it may, we come next to consider their authority; and here
we are met with the greatest difficulty, for it is certain that despite the statements to the
contrary, these books were not those sent to Pope Hadrian by Charlemagne, those of which
the Pope deigned to write a refutation. This Hefele has clearly proved, by pointing out that
those sent to the Pope treated the matter in an entirely different order; that there were in
those sent only 85 chapters, while these books have 120 (or 121 if the authenticity of the last
chapter is granted). Moreover the quotations made by Hadrian do not occur verbatim in
the Caroline books, but are in some cases enlarged, in others abbreviated. (Cf. Hefele’s
treatment of the whole subject in the original German.) Petavius thinks that what Hadrian
received were extracts from the Caroline Books, made by the Council of Frankfort.</p>
<p>Hefele arrives at a directly opposite conclusion, viz., that the Caroline Books are an expansion
of the Capitula sent to the Pope, and that this expansion was made at the bidding
of Charlemagne.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that Baronius, Bellarmine, Binius, and Surius all question the
authenticity of the Caroline Books altogether. (Vide Baron, Annal., a.d., 794.) But this extreme
position seems to be refuted by the fact that certain quotations made by Hincmar are
found in the books as we have them. (Cf. Sirmond in Mansi, Tom. XIII., 905, Labbe, Tom.
VII., col. 1054.)</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
<pb n="1128"/>
<head>III. Contents of the Caroline Books.</head>
<p>If the authorship and authority of these books are difficult subjects, the contents of the
books are still more extraordinary, for it seems to be certain, past all possibility of doubt,
that the authors of these books had never read the acts nor decrees of the Seventh Ecumenical
Synod, of which they were writing; and further that he or they were also completely ignorant
of what took place at the Conciliabulum of 754.</p>
<p>One example will be sufficient to prove this point. In Book IV., Chapter XIV., and also
in chapter XX., (Migne’s ed., col. 1213 and col. 1226), the charge is made that the Seventh
Council, especially Gregory, the bishop of Neocæsarea, unduly flattered the Empress. Now
as a matter of fact the remarks referred to were made at the Conciliabulum of 754, and not
at the Second Council of Nice; they were not made by Gregory of Neocæsarea at all, and
the reason they are attributed to him is because he read them in the proceedings of that
pseudo-council to the true council of 787.</p>
<p>Other examples could easily be given, but this is sufficient. Ab uno disce omnes. The
most famous however of all the ignorant blunders found in these books must not here be
omitted. It occurs in Book III., chapter xvij., and is no less serious than to attribute to
Constantius, the bishop of Cyprus, the monstrous statement that the sacred images were to
be given the supreme adoration due to the Holy Trinity. What a complete mistake this was,
we have already pointed out, and will have been evident to anyone who has read the extracts
of the acts given in the foregoing pages. I have said “mistake;” and I have said so deliberately,
because I am convinced that the Caroline books, the decree of Frankfort, and the decision
of the Convention of Paris, all sprung from ignorance and blundering; and largely through
the force of this particular false statement on which I am writing. But I must not omit the
statement of Sir William Palmer, a champion of these books, that “the acts of the synod of
Nice having been sent to Rome in the year 787, Pope Hadrian himself, according to Hincmar,
transmitted them into France to Charlemagne, to be confirmed by the bishops of his kingdom;
and the Emperor <del>i.e. Charlemagne</del> also received the acts directly from Constantinople
according to Roger Hovedon. These prelates, thus furnished with an authentic copy and
not a mere translation, composed a reply to the synod” (Treatise on the Church, Vol. II., p.
203).</p>
<p>If Sir William is right, then the author of the Caroline books is thrown into a dark shade
indeed, for either he was too ignorant or too careless to read the original Greek, or else,
knowing the real state of the case, deliberately misrepresented the synod. Sir William feels
this difficulty, and, a few lines below the sentence I have quoted, attributes the misstatements
to a “mistranslation,” viz. the false statement—upon which alone all the rest hung—attributed
to the bishop of Cyprus. But the two claims are contraria inter se. If they were using an
authentic copy of the original sent from Constantinople then they could not have been
misled by a “mistranslation;” if they used a mistranslation and took no pains to read the

<pb n="1129"/>
decrees, their opinion and their writings—as well as the decrees which followed from
them—were evidently entirely without theological value, and this is the estimation in which
they have been held by all unprejudiced scholars without exception, whether agreeing with
their conclusions or no.</p>
<p>It will be well to set plainly before the reader the foundation upon which rests the dogmatic
teaching of the Caroline Books. This is, in short, the authority of the Roman See.
That there may be no possible doubt upon this point, I proceed to quote somewhat at length
chapter vi., of Book I.; the heading of which reads as follows: “That the Holy Roman Catholic
and Apostolic Church is placed above all other Churches, and is to be consulted at every
turn when any controversy arises with regard to the faith.”</p>
<p>“Before entering upon a discussion of the witnesses which the Easterns have absurdly
brought forward in their Synod, we think well to set forth how greatly the holy Roman
Church has been exalted by the Lord above the other Churches, and how she is to be consulted
by the faithful: and this is especially the case since only such books as she receives
as canonical and only such Fathers as she has recognized by Gelasius and the other Pontiffs,
his successors, are to be accepted and followed; nor are they to be interpreted by the private
will of anyone, but wisely and soberly.<gap reason="omitted"/>For as the Apostolic Sees in general are to be preferred
to all the other dioceses of the world, much more is that see to be preferred which is
placed over all the other apostolic sees. For just as the Apostles were exalted above the
other disciples, and Peter was exalted above the other Apostles, so the apostolic sees are
exalted above the other sees, and the Roman See is eminent over the other apostolic sees.
And this exaltation arises from no synodical action of the other Churches, but she holds the
primacy (primatum) by the authority of the Lord himself, when he said, ‘Thou art Peter,
etc.’<gap reason="omitted"/></p>
<p>“This church, therefore, fortified with the spiritual arms of the holy faith, and satiated
with the health-giving fountains which flow from the well of light and from the source of
goodness, resists the horrible and atrocious monsters of heresies, and ministers the honeysweet
cups of teaching to the Catholic Churches of the whole world.<gap reason="omitted"/>Whence <del>i.e. from
St. Jerome consulting the Pope</del> we can understand how Saints and learned men who were
shining lights in different parts of the world, not only did not depart in faith from the holy
Roman Church, but also asked aid of her in time of necessity for the strengthening of the
faith. And this all Catholic Churches should regularly observe, so that they may seek help
from her, after Christ, for protecting the faith: which (quæ) having neither spot nor wrinkle,
smites the portentous heads of heresies, and strengthens the minds of the faithful in the
faith. And although many have separated from this holy and venerable communion, nevertheless
never have the Churches of our part done so, but instructed by that apostolical erudition,
and by his assistance from whom cometh every good and perfect gift, have always
received the venerable charismata<gap reason="omitted"/>; and are careful to follow the see of blessed Peter in all

<pb n="1130"/>
things, as they desire thither to arrive where he sits as keeper of the keys. To which
blessedness may he who deigned to found his Church upon Peter bring us, and make us to
persevere in the unity of the holy Church; and may we merit a place in that kingdom of
heaven through the intervention of him whose See we follow and to whom have been given
the keys.”</p>
<p>Such is the doctrinal foundation of the Caroline books, viz.: the absolute authority of
the Roman See in matters pertaining to the faith of the Church. It is certainly very difficult
to understand how the author of these books could have known that the doctrinal decree
of the Synod of Nice had received the approbation of this supreme power which it was so
necessary to consult and defer to; and that the Synod which he denounces and rejects had
been received by that chief of all the Apostolic Sees as the Seventh of the Ecumenical
Councils of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Whether the author <del>or authors</del> had ever seen the Pope’s letter or no, one thing is certain,
he never read with any care even the imperfect translation with which he had been
furnished, and of that translation Anastasius Bibliothetius says: “The translator both misunderstood
the genius of the Greek language as well as that of the Latin, and has merely
translated word for word; and in such a fashion that it is scarcely ever possible to know (aut
vix aut nunquam) what it means; moreover nobody ever reads this translation and no copies
of it are made.”548</p>
<p>This being the case, when we come to examine the Caroline Books, we are not astonished
to find them full of false statements.</p>
<p>In the Preface we are told that the Conciliabulum was “held in Bithynia;” of course as
a matter of fact it met in Constantinople.</p>
<p>In Bk. I., chapter j., we find certain words said to occur in the letters of the Empress and
her son. On this Hefele remarks: “One cannot find the words in either of the two letters of
these sovereigns, which are preserved in the acts of the Council of Nice, it is the synod that
uses them.549”</p>
<p>In the Second Book, chapter xxvij., the council is charged with saying “Just as the Lord’s
body and blood pass over from fruits of the earth to a notable mystery, so also the images,
made by the skill of the artificers, pass over to the veneration of those persons whose images
they bear.” Now this was never said nor taught by the Nicene Synod, but something like it
was taught by the Constantinopolitan conciliabulum of 754; but the very words cited occur
neither in the one set of acts nor in the other! The underlying thought however was, as we
have said, clearly exposed by the iconoclastic synod of 754 and as clearly refuted by the orthodox
synod of 787.</p>
<note type="footnote">548 Mansi, Tom. xii., 981.</note>
<note type="footnote">549 Hefele. Hist. of Councils, Bk. xx., chap. ij., § 400.</note>

<pb n="1131"/>
<p>In Book III., chapter V., we are told that “Tarasius said in his confession of faith that
the Holy Spirit was the companion (contribulum in the Caroline Books) of the Father and
of the Son.” It was not Tarasius who said so at all, but Theodore of Jerusalem, and in using
the word ὁμόφυλος he was but copying Sophronius of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Chapter XVII. begins thus: “How rashly and (so to speak) like a fool, Constantine,
bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, spoke when he said, with the approval of the rest of the
bishops, that he would receive and honourably embrace the images; and babbled that the
service of adoration which is due to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity, should be
given images, we need not here discuss, since to all who either read or hear this it will be
clear that he was swamped in no small error, to wit to confess that he exhibited to creatures
the service due to the Creator alone, and through his desire to favour the pictures overturned
all the Holy Scriptures. For what sane man ever either said or thought of saying such an
absurdity, as that different pictures should be held in the same honour as the holy, victorious
Trinity, the creator of all things, etc.” But as will be seen by a glance at the acts this is exactly
the opposite of what Constantine did say. Now if, as Sir William Palmer asserts, the author
had before him the genuine acts in the original, I do not see how his honesty can be defended,
or if his honesty is kept intact, it must be at the expense of his learning or carefulness. Bower
felt this so keenly that he thinks the Caroline Books attribute the words to Constantine the
bishop alone and not to the council. But the subterfuge is vain, for, as we have just seen,
the author affirms that Constantine’s speech received “the assent of the rest of the bishops
(cæteris consentientibus),” and further not obscurely suggests that Constantine had the
courage to say what the others were content to think, but did not dare to say.</p>
<p>In Book IV., the third chapter distinctly states that while lights and incense were used
by them in their churches, yet that neither the one nor the other was placed before images.
If this can be relied upon it would seem to fix the Frankish custom of that date.</p>
<p>Chapters XIV. and XX. are distinguished by the most glaring blunders, for they attribute
to the Council of Nice the teachings of the Conciliabulum, and in particular they lay them
to the door of Gregory of Neocæsarea because he it was who read them.</p>
<p>Finally, in chapter the twenty-eighth, the ecumenical character of II. Nice is denied, on
the ground that it has not preserved the faith of the Fathers, and that it was not universal
in its constitution. I beg the reader, who has fresh in his memory the Papal claims set forth
in a previous chapter, to consider whether it is possible that the author of that chapter should
have seen and known of the Papal acceptance of the Seventh Synod and yet have written as
follows: “Among all the inanities said and done by this synod, this does not seem by any
means to be the least, that they styled it ecumenical, for it neither held the purity of the
ecumenical faith, nor did it obtain authority through the ecumenical action of the
Churches.<gap reason="omitted"/>If this synod had kept clear of novelties and had rested satisfied with the
teachings of the ancient Fathers, it might have been styled ecumenical. But since it was not

<pb n="1132"/>
contented with the teachings of the ancient Fathers it cannot be styled ecumenical,” etc.,
etc.</p>
<p>Such are in brief the contents and spirit of the Caroline Books. Binius indeed says that
he found a twenty-ninth chapter in a French ms. of Hadrian’s Epistle. It is lacking in the
ordinary codices. Petavius thinks it was added by the Council of Frankfort. It is found in
Migne (col. 1218) and the main point is that St. Gregory’s advice is to be followed, viz.: “We
permit images of the Saints to be made by whoever is so disposed, as well in churches as out
of them, for the love of God and of his Saints; but never compel anyone who does not wish
to do so to bow to them (adorare eas); nor do we permit anyone to destroy them, even if he
should so desire.” I cannot but think that this would be a very lame conclusion to all the
denunciation of the preceding chapters.</p>

<head>IV. The Chief Cause of Trouble a Logomachy.</head>
<p>Now from all this one thing is abundantly clear, that the great point set forth with such
learning and perspicuity by the Seventh Synod, to wit, the distinction between λατρεία and
προσκύνεσις was wholly lost upon these Frankish writers; and that their translation of both
words by “adoro” gave rise to nine-tenths of the trouble that followed. The student of ecclesiastical
history will remember how a similar logomachy followed nearly every one of the
Ecumenical Synods, and will not therefore be astonished to find it likewise here. The
“homousion,” the “theotocos,” the “two natures,” “the two wills,” each one gave rise to
heated discussion in different sections of the Church, even after it had been accepted and
approved by a Synod which no one now for an instant disputes to have been ecumenical.</p>
<p>Moreover, that after this serious error and bungling on the part of the Caroline divines
and of the French and Allemanic Churches, the Pope did not proceed to enforce the acceptance
of the council will not cause astonishment to any who are familiar with what St. Athanasius
said with regard to the Semi-Arians, who even after I. Nice refused to use the word
“homousios;” or with the extreme gentleness and moderation of St. Cyril of Alexandria in
his treatment of John of Antioch.</p>
<p>Perhaps before leaving the subject I should give here the chief strictures which Hefele
makes upon these books (§ 400).</p>
<p>(1) The Caroline Books condemn passages which they quote (without saying so) from
Pope Hadrian’s own letter to the Empress.</p>
<p>(2) They blame St. Basil for teaching that the reverence done to the image passes on to
the prototype.</p>
<p>(3) They treat St. Gregory Nyssen with contempt, and refuse to listen to him (Lib. II.,
c. xvij.).</p>
<p>(4) They are full of most careless and inexcusable blunders.</p>
<p>(a) They attribute to the Emperors a phrase which belongs to the Synod (I. j.).</p>
<p>(b) They confound Leontius with John (I. xxj.).</p>
<p>(c) They confound Tarasius with Theodore of Jerusalem (III. v.).</p>
<p>(d) They impute to the Council the opinions of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum
(IV., xiv. and xx. ).</p>
<p>(e) They attribute to Epiphanius the deacon the propositions of others when he
merely read (IV., xv.)</p>
<p>It had usually been supposed that these Four Books were the “quædam capitula” which
Charlemagne had sent by Angelbert to Pope Hadrian “to be corrected by his judgment (ut
illius judicio corrigerentur). Considering the nature of the contents of the Caroline Books
as we now have them, such would seem à priori highly improbable, but this matter has been

<pb n="1134"/>
practically settled, as we have already pointed out, by Bishop Hefele, who has shown from
Pope Hadrian’s answer “correcting” those “capitula,” that they must have been entirely
different in order though no doubt their contents were similar. The differing views of
Petavius and Walch will be found in full in Hefele (§ 401).</p>
<p>In concluding his masterly treatment of this whole matter, Hefele makes (§ 402) a remark
well worthy of repetition in this place:</p>
<p>“The great friendship which Charles shewed to Pope Hadrian down to the hour of his
death proves that their way of thinking with regard to the cultus of images was not so opposite
as many suppose, and—above all—as many have tried to make out.”</p>
<p>I shall close this matter with the admirably learned and judicious words of Michaud.
“No doubt there had been abuses in connexion with the worship of images; but the
Council of Nice never approved of these. No doubt, too, certain marks of veneration used
in the East were not practised in Gaul; but the Council of Nice did not go into these particulars.
It merely determined the principle, to wit, the lawfulness and moral necessity of
honouring the holy images; and in doing this it did not in any degree innovate. Charlemagne
ought to have known this, for, already in the sixth century Fortunatus, in his Poem on St.
Martin, tells how in Gaul they lighted lamps before the images.550 The great point that
Charlemagne made was that what was called in the West ‘adoration,’ in the strict sense (that
is to say the worship of Latria) should be rendered to none other than God; now this is exactly
the doctrine of the Council of Nice. Charlemagne himself admits that the learned may
venerate images, meaning thereby that the veneration is really addressed to the prototypes,
but that such veneration is a source of scandal to the ignorant who in the image venerate551
nothing but the material image itself (Lib. III., cap. xvj.).”552</p>
<note type="footnote">550 “Here on the wall is an image of the Saint and under its feet a little window, and a lamp, in the glass bowl

<head>Excursus on the Council of Frankfort, a.d. 794.</head>
<p>It has been commonly represented that the Council of Frankfort, which was a large
Synod of the West, with legates of the Pope present and composed of the bishops of Gaul,
Germany, and Aquitaine, devoted its attention to a consideration of the question of the ven
eration due to images and of the claims of the Second Council of Nice to being an Ecumenical
Synod. I do not know upon what grounds such statements have rested, but certainly
not upon anything revealed by any remains of the council we possess, for among these we
find but one brief paragraph upon the subject, to wit, the Second Canon, which reads as
follows (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. vii, col. 1057):</p>
<p>“II. The question was brought forward concerning the recent synod which the Greeks
had held at Constantinople concerning the adoration of images, that all should be judged
as worthy of anathema who did not pay to the images of the Saints service and adoration
as to the Divine Trinity. Our most holy fathers rejected with scorn and in every way such
adoration and service, and unanimously condemned it.”</p>
<p>Now in the first place I call the reader’s attention to the fact that the Conciliabulum of
754 was held at Constantinople but that the Seventh Council was held at Nice. It would
seem as if the two had got mixed in the mind of the writer.553</p>
<p>In the second place neither of these synods, nor any other synod, decreed that the “service”
(λατρεία) and “adoration” (προσκύνησις) due to the holy Trinity was under pain of
anathema to be given to “the images of the Saints.”</p>
<p>On this second canon Hefele writes as follows:</p>
<p>(Hefele. Concil., § 398).</p>
<p>The second of these canons deserves our full attention; in it, as we have seen, the Synod
of Frankfort expresses its feeling against the Second Ecumenical Council of Nice, and against
the veneration of images; Eginhard also gives us the information that it took this action,
viz.: “for it was decided by all <del>i.e. at Frankfort</del> that the synod, which a few years before
was gathered together in Constantinople (sic) under Irene and her son Constantine, and is
called by them not only the Seventh but also Ecumenical, should neither be held nor declared
to be the Seventh nor ecumenical but wholly without authority.”</p>
<p>Hefele rejects the views of Baronius, Bellarmine, Surius, and Binius. I have no intention
of defending the position of any one of these writers but I translate Binius’s note, merely
remarking that it is easier to reject his conclusion than to answer the arguments upon which
it rests.</p>
<note type="footnote">553 This has been explained by saying that the last meeting was in the palace at Constantinople.</note>

<pb n="1136"/>
<p>(Severinus Binius, Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VII., col. 1070.)</p>
<p>Baronius was of opinion that the Second Council of Nice was condemned by this
council; and before him Bellarmine had taught the same thing. But two things make me
dissent from their conclusion:</p>
<p>First. That as the history and acts of this council inform us that the legates of Pope
Hadrian (whom Ado in his chronology names Theophylact and Stephen) were present at
this council, it was not possible that the whole council was ignorant by what authority the
true Seventh Council was assembled at Nice, and what its decrees had been. For as this
Synod at Nice was assembled under the same Pontiff, the legates of that same Pontiff could
not have been ignorant of its authority and teaching. Therefore even if false rumours concerning
the Seventh Synod had been scattered about, as Genebrardus affirms (on what
foundation I know not), the Fathers of the Council of Frankfort could have been instructed
by the papal legates, and been given information and taught what were the writings of that
Seventh Council. Moreover since the celebration of that Nicene Council was an event most
celebrated and most widely published throughout the whole Church, it is not credible that
among the bishops of all France and Germany, assembled in this place, no single one was
found who had accurate information concerning the manner in which the Council of Nice
was assembled, or of how it had received the approval of the Supreme Pontiff. For as a
matter of fact, that error of adoring images as gods is rather an error of the Gentiles than of
any heretics or of any who profess the faith of Christ. Therefore in no way is it credible that
the fathers of the Council of Frankfort should have thought this, or rashly on account of
certain rumours have believed this; especially since at that time in no Church was there the
suspicion of any such error; and the bishops of the council were too pious and Catholic to
allow the suspicion that out of base enmity to the Orientals they were led to attribute error
to the fathers of the most sacred Council of Nice, or that they would have attached an
heretical sense to their decision.</p>
<p>Another reason is this; that the fathers of this council often made profession of acting
under the obedience of the Roman Pontiffs; and in the book Sacrosyllabus at the end, when
they gave sentence against the heretics, they subjoin these words: “The privilege of our lord
and father the Supreme Pontiff, Hadrian I. Pope of the most blessed See, being in all respects
maintained.” And this same principle the same fathers often professed in this council, that
they followed the tradition of their predecessors, and did not depart from their footsteps;
and that Charlemagne, who was present, at this council, in his letter to the Spanish bishops,
said that in the first place he had consulted the pontiff of the Apostolic See, what he thought
concerning the matter treated of in that council: and that a little further on he adds these
words: “I am united to the Apostolic see, and to the ancient Catholic traditions which have
come down from the beginnings of the new-born Church, with my whole mind, and with
complete alacrity of heart.”</p>

<pb n="1137"/>
<p>Now the fathers of this council could not make such a profession if they had condemned
the Sacrosant Synod of Nice, which had been confirmed by the Apostolic See. For as I have
shown above they could not have been misled by false information upon this point. If
therefore knowingly and through heretical pravity they did these things, so too they did
them out of pertinacity and heresy; and so concerning the authority of the Apostolic See
one way they had thought and another way spoken. But in my judgment such things are
not to be imputed to so great and to such an assembly of bishops, for it is not likely that the
fathers of this council, in the presence of the legates of the Supreme Pontiff and of a Catholic
Prince, would have condemned the Seventh Synod, confirmed as it was by the authority of
the Pontiff and have referred the matter to Hadrian the Supreme Pontiff.</p>
<p>Moreover it would have surely come to pass that if the Nicene Council had been condemned
by the authority of this synod, and so the error of the Iconoclasts had been approved
through erroneous information, before our days some follower of that error would have
tried to back up himself and his opinion by its authority: but no one did this, and this is all
the more noteworthy since, only shortly after the time of Charlemagne, Claudius of Turin
sprang up in that very Gaul, and wished to introduce that error into the Western Church,
and he could have confirmed his teaching in the highest manner if he could have shewn
that that plenary council of the West had confirmed his error. But as a matter of fact
Claudius did not quote it in his favour; nor did Jonas of Orleans, who wrote against him at
that time, and overthrew his foundations, make any mention in this respect of the Council
of Frankfort in his response.</p>
<p>Lastly I add that the Roman Church never gave its approbation and received any provincial
synod, so far as one part of its action was concerned while in another part it was
persistently heretical. But this provincial council so far as it defined concerning the servitude
and filiation of Christ was received and approved by the Church, it is not then credible that
in the same council the Nicene Synod would have been condemned.</p>
<p>I need only add that every proposed theory is so full of difficulties as to seem to involve
more absurdities and improbabilities than it explains. The reader is referred especially to
Vasquez (De adorat. imag., Lib. II., Dispt. VII., cap. vij.) and to Suarez (Tom. I, Disp. LIV.,
Sec. iij.), for learned and instructive discussions of the whole matter.</p>

<head>Excursus on the Convention said to have been held in Paris, a.d. 825.</head>
<p>It is curious that besides the Caroline Books and the second canon of Frankfort, another
matter of great difficulty springs up with regard to the subject of the authority of the Seventh
Synod. In 1596 there appeared what claims to be an ancient account of a convention of
bishops in Paris in the year 824.554 The point in which this interests us is that the bishops
at this meeting are supposed to have condemned the Seventh Council, and to have approved
the Caroline books. The whole story was rejected by Cardinal Bellarmine and he promptly
wrote a refutation. Sismondi accepted this view of the matter, and Labbe has excluded the
pretended proceedings from his “Concilia” altogether.</p>
<p>But while scholars are agreed that the assigned date is impossible and that it must be
825, they have usually accepted the facts as true, I need not mention others than such widely
differing authors as Fleury (Hist. Eccles., Lib. xlvij. iv.), Roisselet de Sauclières (Hist. Chronol.,
Tome III., No. 792, p. 385), and Hefele (Concilien, § 425).</p>
<p>It would be the height of presumption were I to express any opinion upon this most
disputed point, the reader will find the whole matter at length in Walch (Bd. XI., S. 135,
139). I only here note that if the account be genuine, then it is an established fact that as
late as 825, an assembly of bishops rejected an Ecumenical Council accepted by the pope,
and further charged the Supreme Pontiff with having “commanded men to adore superstitiously
images (quod superstitiose eas adorare jussit),” and asked the reigning Pontiff to
correct the errors of his predecessors, and all this without any reproof from the Holy See!</p>
<p>Hefele points out also that they not only entirely misrepresent the teaching of Hadrian
and the Seventh Council, but that they also cite a passage from St. Augustine, “which teaches
exactly the opposite of that which this synod would make out, for the passage says that the
word colere can be applied to men.”</p>
<note type="footnote">554 This is reprinted in full in Mansi, and from him in Migne’s Pat. Lat., Tom. XCVIII., col. 1299, et seqq.

<head>Historical Note on the So-Called “Eighth General Council” and Subsequent
Councils.</head>
<p>Whatever may be the final verdict of history with regard to the Caroline books, to the
action of this Synod of Frankfort, and to the genuineness of the account of the Convention
of Paris, there can be no doubt with regard to the position held by the Seventh of the Ecumenical
Synods in all subsequent conciliar action.</p>
<p>In 869555 was held at Constantinople what both the Easterns and Westerns then considered
to be the Eighth of the Ecumenical Synods. Its chief concern was to restore peace
and it thought to accomplish this by taking the strongest position against Photius. At this
Synod the Second Council of Nice was accepted in the most explicit manner, not only its
teaching but also its rank and number.556</p>
<p>But not many years afterwards Photius again got the upper hand and another synod
was held, also at Constantinople, in a.d. 879, which restored Photius and which was afterwards
accepted by many Easterns as the Eighth of the Ecumenical Synods. But at this synod, as
well as in that of 869, the position of Second Nice was fully acknowledged. So that after that
date, roughly speaking one century after the meeting of the Seventh Synod, despite all opposition
it was universally recognized and revered, even by those who were so rapidly
drifting further and further apart as were the East and West in the time of Photius and his
successors.</p>
<p>At the Council of Lyons in a.d. 1274 there was consent on all hands that all were united
in accepting the Seven Synods as a basis of union.</p>
<p>And finally when the acts and agreements of the Council of Florence (1438) appeared
in the first edition issued under papal authority, that synod was styled the “Eighth,” and in
this there was no accident, for during the debate the Cardinal Julian Cæsarini had asked the
Greeks for the proceedings of the Eighth Synod and Mark answered: “We cannot be forced
to count that synod as ecumenical, since we do not at all recognize it but in fact reject it.<gap reason="omitted"/>“A
few years afterwards was held a second synod which restored Photius and annulled the acts
of the preceding assembly, and this synod also bears the title of the Eighth Ecumenical. But
Cardinal Julian did not enter on any defence of the Ecumenical character of this so-called
“Eighth Synod.”557</p>
<note type="footnote">555 Hefele. Concilien, § 487, also Fleury.</note>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, the matter is perfectly clear, and even if some later
writers speak still of the “Six Ecumenical Councils” in doing so they are rejecting the Eighth
as much as the Seventh; in fact they are rejecting neither, but speaking as did St. Gregory,
who still mentioned the Four General Councils and compared them to the Four Gospels,
although the fifth had been already held. Those few Frankish writers who continued to
speak of II. Nice as a pseudo council did so out of ignorance or else in contrariety to the
teaching of the Roman Church to whose obedience they professed subjection. It is no place
of mine to offer moral reflections upon their doings.</p>

<head>Prefatory Note.</head>
<p>As this volume only professes to contain the conciliar decrees of the Ecumenical
Councils, it would seem that canons and rulings which were of private or quasi-private
origin should have no place in it; and yet a very considerable number of such determinations
are expressly approved by name in the Canons of the Synod in Trullo, which canons were
received, to some extent at least (as we have seen), by the Seventh Ecumenical Council.
Under these circumstances I have felt that the reader might justly expect to find some
mention made of these decrees, which while indeed non-conciliar in origin, yet had received
such high conciliar sanction. I have therefore placed a translation of the text of the
“Apostolical Canons” with a brief introduction, and have reprinted Johnson’s epitome of
the other decrees and canons, supplying a few omissions and adding a few notes, chiefly
taken from the Greek scholiasts, Zonaras and Balsamon. It is hoped that thus the present
volume has been made practically complete, and that from it, any student can obtain a satisfactory
knowledge of all the doctrinal definitions and of all the disciplinary enactments of
the undivided Church.</p>

<head>The Apostolical Canons.</head>
<p>Introduction.</p>
<p>To affirm that the “Apostolical Canons” were a collection of canons made by the Apostles
would be about as sensible as to affirm that the “Psalterium Davidicum”559 was a collection
of his own psalms made by David, or that the “Proverbs of Solomon” was a collection of
proverbs made by Solomon.</p>
<p>Many of the Psalms had David for their composer; many of the Proverbs had Solomon
for their originator; but neither the book we call “The Psalter” nor the book we call “The
Proverbs” had David or Solomon for its compiler. The matter contained in the one is largely,
many think chiefly, of Davidic origin, the matter contained in the other is no doubt Solomonic;
and just so “The Apostolical Canons” may well be to a great extent of Apostolic origin,
committed to writing, some possibly by the Apostles themselves, others by their immediate
successors, who heard them at their mouth; and these at some period not far removed from
the date of the Nicene Council (a.d. 325), probably earlier than the Council of Antioch, were
gathered together into a code which has since then been somewhat enlarged and modified.
This is the view of the matter to which the general drift of the learned seems to be moving,
and it is substantially the view so ably defended by Bishop Beveridge in his Synodicon, and
in his remarkably learned and convincing answer to his French opponent,560 entitled Codex
Canonum Ecclesiæ Primitivæ vindicatus ac illustratus. (This last volume, together with the
“Preface to the Notes on the Apostolical Canons” has been reprinted in Vol. XII. of Bishop
Beveridge’s Works in the “Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology.”)561</p>
<p>In thus accepting in the main the old conclusions I am far from intending to imply that
more recent research has not shewn some of the details of the bishop’s view to be erroneous.
In brief, the proposition which seems to be most tenable is that in the main the Apostolic
Canons represent the very early canon-law of the Church, that the canons which make up
the collection are of various dates, but that most of them are earlier than the year 300, and
that while it is not possible to say exactly when the collection, as we now have it, was made,
<note type="footnote">559 The reader may remember that when it was proposed in a first draft to the Council of Trent to say the
“Psalms of David,” the Fathers refused to pass it as proposed, because the Psalter contained Psalms not by
David, and substituted the expression “The Davidic Psalter” (Psalterium Davidicum).</note>

<note type="footnote">561 It is most unfortunate that the Rev. A. B. Grosart, LL.D., in the article “Beveridge” in that usually accurate
and learned work, the Dictionary of English Biography, should have written “regretting” this republication of
the Vindicatio, on the ground that Bp. Beveridge in its pages “demonstrates that he lacked the instincts of the
genuine scholar as distinguished from the merely largely read man!” There seem to be a great many soidisant
“genuine scholars” who lack all sense of humour!</note>

<pb n="1144"/>
there is good reason for assigning it a date not later than the middle of the fourth century.
With regard to the name “Apostolic Canons” there need be no more hesitation in applying
it to these canons than in calling Ignatius an “Apostolic Father,” the adjective necessarily
meaning nothing more than that the canons set forth the disciplinary principles which were
given to the early Church by the Apostles, just as we speak of the “Apostles’ Creed.”</p>
<p>While this is true there can be no question that in the East the Apostolic Canons were
very generally looked upon as a genuine work prepared by the Holy Apostles. I proceed
now to quote Bishop Hefele, but I have already (Cf. Council in Trullo) expressed my own
opinion that there is not contained in the Quinisext decree any absolute definition of what
is technically known as the “authenticity” of the Canons of the Apostles.</p>
<p>(Hefele. Hist. of the Councils, Vol. I., p. 451 et seqq.).</p>
<p>The Synod in Trullo being, as is well known, regarded as ecumenical by the Greek
Church, the authenticity of the eighty-five canons was decided in the East for all future
time. It was otherwise in the West. At the same period that Dionysius Exiguus translated
the collection question for Bishop Stephen, Pope Gelasius promulgated his celebrated decree
de libris non recipiendis. Drey mentions it, but in a way which requires correction. Following
in this the usual opinion, he says that the Synod at Rome in which Gelasius published this
decree was held in 494; but we shall see hereafter that this synod was held in 496. Also Drey
considers himself obliged to adopt another erroneous opinion, according to which Gelasius
declared in the same decree the Apostolic Canons to be apocryphal. This opinion is to be
maintained only so long as the usual text of this decree is consulted, since the original text
as it is given in the ancient manuscripts does not contain the passage which mentions the
Apostolic Canons.562 This passage was certainly added subsequently, with many others,
probably by Pope Hormisdas (514–543) when he made a new edition of the decree of
Gelasius. As Dionysius Exiguus published his collection in all probability subsequently to
the publication of the decree of Gelasius, properly so called, in 496, we can understand why
this decree did not mention the Apostolical Canons. Dionysius did not go to Rome while
Gelasius was living, and did not know him personally, as he himself says plainly in the
Præfatio of his collection of the papal decrees. It is hence also plain how it was that in another
collection of canons subsequently made by Dionysius, of which the preface still remains
to us, he does not insert the Apostolic Canons, but has simply this remark: Quos non admisit
uniniversalitas, ego quoque in hoc opere prætermisi. Dionysius Exiguus in fact compiled
this new collection at a time when Pope Hormisdas had already explicitly declared the
Apostolic Canons to be apocryphal.</p>
<note type="footnote">562 Cf. Ballerini, Opp. S. Leon. M., Vol. III. p. 158; Mansi, Conc., Tom. VIII., 170.</note>

<pb n="1145"/>
<p>Notwithstanding this, these canons, and particularly the fifty mentioned by Dionysius,
did not entirely fall into discredit in the West; but rather they came to be received, because
the first collection of Dionysius was considered of great authority. They also passed into
other collections, and particularly into that of the pseudo-Isidore; and in 1054, Humbert,
legate of Pope Leo IX., made the following declaration: Clementis libel, id est itinerarium
Petri Apostoli et Canones Apostolorum numerantur inter apocrypha, Exceptis Capitulis
Quisquaginta, quæ decreverunt regulis orthodoxis adjungenda. Gratian also, in his decree,
borrowed from the fifty Apostolic Canons, and they gradually obtained the force of laws.
But many writers, especially Hincmar of Rheims, like Dionysius Exiguus, raised doubts
upon the apostolical origin of these canons. From the sixteenth century the opinion has
been universal that these documents are not authentic; with the exception, however, of the
French Jesuit Turrianus, who endeavoured to defend their genuineness, as well as the authenticity
of the pseudo-Isidorian decrees. According to the Centuriators of Magdeburg,
it was especially Gabriel d’Aubespine, Bishop of Orleans, the celebrated Archbishop Peter
de Marca, and the Anglican Beveridge, who proved that they were not really compiled by
the Apostles, but were made partly in the second and chiefly in the third century. Beveridge
considered this collection to be a repertory of ancient canons given by synods in the second
and third centuries. In opposition to them, the Calvinist Dallæus (Daillé) regarded it as the
work of a forger who lived in the fifth and sixth centuries; but Beveridge refuted him so
convincingly, that from that time his opinion, with some few modifications, has been that
of all the learned.</p>
<p>Beveridge begins with the principle, that the Church in the very earliest times must have
had a collection of canons; and he demonstrates that from the commencement of the fourth
century, bishops, synods, and other authorities often quote, as documents in common use,
a κανὼν αποστολικὸς, or ἐκκλησιαστικὸς, or ἀρχαῖος; as was done, for instance, at the
Council of Nice, by Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, and by the Emperor Constantine,
etc.563 According to Beveridge, these quotations make allusion to the Apostolic Canons,
and prove that they were already in use before the fourth century.</p>
<p>In opposition to Beveridge Dr. von Drey wrote with profound learning;564 and Bickell,
in his work just quoted, to a great degree accepts his conclusions as being well-founded.</p>
<p>These conclusions in short are that the so-called “Apostolic Canons” are a patchwork
taken from the “Apostolic Constitutions,” which are said to have been of Eastern origin and
to date from the latter part of the third century, and from the canons of various synods,
notably Nice, Antioch, and Chalcedon.</p>
<note type="footnote">563 Cf. (for catena) Bickell, Geschichte des Kirchenrechts, S. 82.</note>
<note type="footnote">564 Neue Untersuchungen über die Const. und Canones der Apostel. Tübing., 1832.</note>

<pb n="1146"/>
<p>But this last reference to Chalcedon is too much for Bickell to stomach; and for many
reasons he makes the date of the collection earlier.</p>
<p>Hefele points out a rather significant document which he says both “Drey and Bickell
have overlooked. In 1738 Scipio Maffei published three ancient documents, the first of
which was a Latin translation of a letter written on the subject of Meletius by the Egyptian
bishops Hesychius, Phileas, etc. This letter was written during the persecution of Diocletian,
that is, between 303 and 305: it is addressed to Meletius himself, and especially accuses him
of having ordained priests in other dioceses. This conduct, they tell him, is contrary to all
ecclesiastical rule (aliena a more divino et regula ecclesiastica), and Meletius himself knows
very well that it is a lex patrum et propatrum…in alienis paræciis non licere alicui episcoporum
ordinationes celebrare. Maffei himself supposes that the Egyptian bishops were here referring
to the thirty-fifth canon (the thirty-sixth according to the enumeration of Dionysius), and
this opinion can hardly be controverted.”</p>
<p>After Bickell and Drey about ten years passed and then Bunsen and Ültzen wrote on
the subject. Of these Bunsen renewed Beveridge’s arguments, and considers the “Apostolic
Canons” as a reflex of the customs of the Primitive Church, if not in the Johannean age, at
latest in that which immediately succeeded; and he is of opinion that the legend attributing
them to the Apostles is earlier in date than the Council of Nice. Ültzen does not express
himself definitely on the point, but in a note to p. xvj. of the Preface to his book regrets that
Bunsen should have renewed Beveridge’s argument with regard to the relative age of the
Apostolic Canons and those of Antioch because in his judgment “all the more recent judges
of this matter had refuted it.”</p>
<p>I think I should here interrupt my narrative to warn the reader that Beveridge has been
often misunderstood and misrepresented. For example he expressly says that according to
his theory565 “these canons were set forth by various synods, so too they seem to us to have
been collected by different persons, of whom some collected more, some fewer.…And these
canons, thus collected, some called ecclesiastical and some called them Apostolical; not that
they believed them to have been written by the very Apostles, for they had made the collection
themselves, but because they were consonant to the doctrine and traditions of the Apostles,
and they were persuaded that they had been originally established at least by apostolic men.”
This is Beveridge’s position in his own words.</p>
<p>I come now to the most recent writings upon the subject. Harnack has developed a
theory which is partly his own with regard to the Apostolical Constitutions, in his edition
of the “Didache,” and has also considered the question of the Apostolic Canons. The fullest
discussion however of the matter is in a work entitled, Die Apostolischen Konstitutionem,
<note type="footnote">565 Bev. Præfatio ad Annotat. in Can. Apost., § xiii.</note>

<pb n="1147"/>
Eine Litteran-historische Untersuchung, von Franz Zaver Funk. Rottenburg am Neckar.
1891.</p>
<p>Funk gives the history of the controversy, and refuses to allow that Hefele’s citation of
the Letter of the Egyptian bishops throws any light upon the point. In most matters he
agrees with Bickell, and declares (p. 188) that “the Synod of Antioch is certainly to be regarded
as the source of the Apostolic Canons,” and that thus by comparing the canons, it is manifest
that the Apostolic “are certainly to be regarded as the dependent writing” (p. 185). And
after considering their relation to the Apostolical Constitutions, Funk states his conclusion
as follows (p. 190): “The drawing up of the canons falls therefore not earlier than the interpolation
of the Didaskalia and the preparation of the two last books of the Constitution,
hence not before the beginning of the fifth century. On the other hand there is no ground
for fixing the writing at a later period, not a single canon bears the mark of a later time.”</p>
<p>Such was the state of things until Mgr. Rihmani, the Syrian Archbishop of Aleppo, gave
notice that he had found in a codex at Mossul a Syrian version of the Apocryphal book
known as the Testamentum Jesu Christi. It is stated that in the discoverer’s opinion the
Testamentum is earlier in date than the Apostolic Canons, than the Canons of Hippolytus,
and than the VIIIth Book of the Apostolic Constitutions; and further that it was the direct
source of the Apostolic Canons. As I know nothing further of this matter, I must simply
note it for the guidance of the reader in his further study of the subject.</p>
<p>Having now traced the history of the discussion, I need only add that Mr. Turner has
just issued a very critical text of the version of Dionysius Exiguus, the full title of which is
as follows:</p>

the mouth. Moreover we might add many things and explain how the excretions from the
belly are necessary to animal life. But if we believe that man is the work of God’s hand, as
we are taught in holy Scripture, how can it be supposed necessary that we perform anything
impure? And if we are the children of God, as the holy Acts of the Apostles teaches, we
have in us nothing unclean, etc., etc.”</del>; nor is matrimony unclean, though virginity <del>“which

<p>As the heretics are quoting apocryphal writings, an evil which was rife even as early as
when St. Luke wrote his gospel, therefore I have thought good to set forth clearly what books
have been received by us through tradition as belonging to the Canon, and which we believe
to be divine. For there are in all twenty-two books of the Old Testament. Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. After this comes Joshua, and Judges, and Ruth. The
four books of the Kings, counted as two. Then Chronicles, counted the two as one. Then
First and Second Esdras <del>i.e. Ezra and Nehemiah</del>. After these Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
and Cantica. To these follow Job, and the Twelve Prophets, counted as one book. Then
Isaiah, Jeremiah together with the Epistle of Baruch, the Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel.</p>
<p>Of the New Testament these are the books <del>then follows the complete list ending with
“the Apocalypse of John”</del>. These are the fountains of salvation, that whoso thirsteth, may
be satisfied by the eloquence which is in them. In them alone (ἐν τούτοις μόνοις) is set
forth the doctrine of piety. Let no one add to them, nor take aught therefrom.</p>
<p>I also add for further accuracy that there are certain other books, not edited in the
Canon, but established by the Fathers, to be read by those who have just come to us and
wish to be instructed in the doctrine of piety. The Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of
Sirach, Esther, Judith, Tobit, the Doctrine (Διδαχή) of the Apostles and the Pastor. And let
none of the Apocrypha of the heretics be read among you.</p>
<note type="footnote">595 Johnson says: “This contains the Canon of Scripture as we now receive it in all respects, save that the
Epistle of Baruch is reckoned in the Canon, but Esther is not. He tells us, there are other books never reckoned
in the Canon but authorized by the fathers to be read by the Catechumens, viz.: Wisdom of Solomon, of Sirach,
Esther, Judith, and Tobias, and that which is called The Doctrine of the Apostles, and Pastor. These (says he) are
read, the other reckoned of the Canons: Apocryphal books are the invention of heretics.” To this Johnson appends
a note, to wit: “It is the common opinion of learned men that the reason why some of the ancients reckoned
the book of Esther not to belong to the Canon, was the Apocryphal chapters added to it by another hand. That
The Doctrine of the Apostles is a book now lost, see Dr. Grabe’s Essay on this subject.” Who these “learned men”
may be, I do not know, but at the time of the writing of St. Athanasius the position of the Hebrew Esther was
not well assured in the restricted Palestinian Jewish Canon. On this point the reader should make himself familiar
with The Canon of the Old Testament by the Rt. Rev. Tobias Mullen, Roman Catholic Bishop of Erie, U.S.A.</note>

<head>Canon I.</head>
<p>As to the question concerning the Puritans the custom of every country is to be observed,
since they who have discussed this point are of various sentiments. The [baptism] of the
Pepuzenes I make no account of, and I wonder that Dionysius the canonist was of another
mind. The ancients speak of heresies, which entirely break men off, and make them aliens
from the faith. Such are the Manichæans, Valentinians, Marcionites and Pepuzenes, who
sin against the Holy Ghost, who baptize into the Father, Son and Montanus, or Priscilla.
Schisms are caused by ecclesiastical disputes, and for causes that are not incurable, and for
differences concerning penance. The Puritans are such schismatics. The ancients, viz.
Cyprian and Fermilian, put these, and the Encratites, and Hydroparastatæ, and Apotactites,
under the same condemnation; because they have no longer the communication of the Holy
Ghost, who have broken the succession. They who first made the departure had the spiritual
gift; but by being schismatics, they became laymen; and therefore they ordered those that
were baptized by them, and came over to the Church, to be purged by the true baptism, as
those that are baptized by laymen. Because some in Asia have otherwise determined, let
<del>heir baptism</del> be allowed: but not that of the Encratites; for they have altered their baptism,
to make themselves incapable of being received by the Church. Yet custom and the Fathers,
that is bishops, who have the administration, must be followed; for I am afraid of putting
an impediment to the saved; while I would raise fears in them concerning their baptism.
We are not to allow their baptism, because they allow ours, but strictly to observe the canons.
But let none be received without unction. When we received Zois and Saturninus to the
Episcopal chair, we made, as it were, a canon to receive those in communion with them.</p>

all which the Fathers concealed from those who were not initiated. He says the dogmata

<p>Because the fast of Epiphany chances to fall on a Lord’s day, let us take a few dates, and

<p>Let <del>the priests</del> who have communicated with the Arians, be retained or rejected, as
the custom of every church is; but so, that other orthodox <del>priests</del> be ordained, though the
others continue. As the orthodox bishops did in Thebais, so let it be in other cities. They
who were ordained by Bishop Apollo, and afterwards communicated with the Arians, if
they did it of their own accord, let them be censured; but if they only did it in obedience to
the bishop, let them be continued; but if all the people abdicate them, others must be ordained.
And if Bistus the priest be found to have committed uncleanness with a woman
dismissed from her husband, let him not be permitted to be a priest. But this is no prejudice
to the bishop who ordained him, if he did it ignorantly; since the Holy Synod commands
unworthy men to be ejected, though they be not convicted until after ordination.</p>

The Canonical Epistle of Our Holy Father Among the Saints, Cyril,
Archbishop of Alexandria, on the Hymns.607
Cyril to Domnus.</head>
<p>This letter contains a complaint of one, Peter, deposed from his See, yet retaining the
character of a bishop, who thought his cause good, but complains that he had not time and
opportunity given him for his defence; and that whatever he had, was taken away from him.
He desires Domnus, who was a Metropolitan, that he would call a synod, and let him have
a hearing; and that such bishops as Peter suspected of prejudice against him should not be
permitted to be his judges. He thinks it very hard, that not only what belonged to the Church,
but every thing else was taken from him; and complains that all bishops were called to account
for every thing they received, whether from the Church, or by any other means. Peter had
indeed signed an instrument of resignation; but Cyril says, that he was terrified into it; and
that he would have no such resignation be of force except he that made it deserved deposition.</p>

<p>There is another Epistle of the same father, complaining to the bishops of Libya and
Pentapolis. That some who had been refused ordination by their own bishop, or cast out
of the monasteries for their irregularity, were ordained by a surprise upon some other
bishop, and that just as they came from their bride-bed, and then went and performed the
oblation, or any other office, in the monasteries from which they had been ejected, which
gave great offence. He charges the bishops to take care of this for the future and, if any were
to be ordained, to enquire into their lives, and whether they are married, and when, and
how; and orders, that catechumens, who had been separated for lapsing, be baptized at the
hour of death.</p>

<p>To the most beloved of God, fellow-minister, Gennadius and the most holy synod assembled
in the royal city which is New Rome, sendeth greeting.</p>
<p>As our Lord without money and without price ordained his Apostles, so should we ordain
the clergy, for the Lord has placed us in their grade and in their stead (ἐις τὸν ἐκείνων
βαθηόν τε καὶ τόπον). Nor should we use any ingenious sophisms to avoid this plain duty,
explicitly laid upon us, not only by the words of the Gospel but also by a canon of the great
Ecumenical Synod of Chalcedon.</p>
<note type="footnote">608 The Greeks speak of the canons of The Thirteen Holy Fathers, counting in the number St. Cyprian’s
canon, but as this was really Synodal I have placed it in that category.</note>

Westminster Confession of Faith by Anonymous</head>
<p>In 1643, one hundred and twenty-one Puritan clergymen met in Westminster Abbey for
the purpose of drafting official documents that would serve to reform the Church of England.
The Westminster Confession of Faith, an extended, systematic summary of Reformed doctrine,
was one of these documents. The Confession still serves as one of the standard texts
of the Church of Scotland, and it remains influential within Presbyterian churches across
the world. This version of the Westminster Confession of Faith is that currently adopted
by the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) and the United Presbyterian Church
in the United States of America (UPCUSA).

<head>Creeds of the Evangelical Protestant Churches. by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>In 1876, this three volume collection of cross-denominational creeds and confessions was
deemed by its publisher a "symbolical library" well worth visiting. Volume III is dedicated
to the Lutheran, Anglican, Calvinistic, and later Protestant Confessions of Faith. Schaff's
third volume is the first publication to compile the Modern Protestant Creeds, a rare group
of documents containing the Congregational, Baptist, and Presbyterian Confessions. It also
includes the Quaker Confession, the Easter Litany of the Moravians, and the Methodist
Articles of Religion. This book is an excellent resource for comparative analysis, as Schaff
provides the documents in their original languages alongside their English translations.
Through Creeds of Christendom, Schaff aims to bring understanding to those who adhere
to different creeds. He wisely reminds us that despite varying Christian denominations,
Christ always remains at the center of the creeds.
